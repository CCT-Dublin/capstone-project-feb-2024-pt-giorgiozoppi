30,Great lunch & great service,"Carmen was an amazing server! She was attentive and the service was quick ‚Äî just what we needed. 

We very much enjoyed the Marguerita pizza and the gazpacho for a light lunch at the hotel. 

The snacks of olives and nuts were a nice treat before the meal.",5,2024,10,16
30,Beautiful hotel and great customer service,"Eva, the hostess @ Azimut restaurant, is so gracious and pleasant each and every morning we had breakfast there.  She even remembered our room number- which made It  so personal!  Thank you Eva for making us feel special!

Also,  I wanted to recognize Carlotta, (Manager or Customer Care Specialist) who provided us with extra care and attention to satisfy our needs.  We needed bottles of water in our room and she promptly had them sent along with some goodies!  She also took the time to stop by my table at breakfast to ensure our stay was going well!  She provided us with excellent customer service! Thank you Carlotta!",5,2024,10,16
30,A great (mostly) Business oriented Hotel in Barcelona.,"QUICK REVIEW:  A very nice (mostly) Business oriented hotel in Barcelona. Outstanding service, friendly staff, excellent amenities.  Solid 4.8 Stars.  Highly Recommend. YES, we will be back.  LONGER DETAILED REVIEW:  We travel extensively and needed a hotel with relatively easy access to the medical area of Barcelona and the airport.  The bonus was the architecture of this hotel was amazing.  Based on reviews and location, decided to give the Hyatt Regency a try.  SERVICE:  From the email arrangements before we arrived, to check in, breakfast service, even maid service - all the people here were outstanding.  Everyone was friendly and attentive. Being a Hyatt Lifetime Globalist - these small details are important.  AMENITIES:  We did not experience all of the amenities, but they do have several lounges, restaurants, gym, and Regency Club.  ROOMS:  We were upgraded to an Executive Suite which are situated in its own private floor.  The layout of the room was well thought out - you can walk through the closet, and it also has a 1/2 extra bath for convenience.  Internet was adequately quick and had a nice work area.  OVERALL:  Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower is a very nice business hotel.  Could be used for a jumping off point for Barcelona's tourist attractions.  Recommend. YES, we would go back.",5,2024,10,15
30,Good as usual...club service was average...good overall,"Great customer service from reception to servers to service team...reception directed me on how to book trains...very timely as trains started getting booked/full by the hour...food was good and they had a DJ..
Ambiance was a little different with a large screen behind lobby...overall great",4,2024,10,15
30,Excellent customer service !!!,"We just arrived Barcelona after settle down and came to lounge for happy hour. I was checking out the drink selection, I told the bartender ‚ÄúPablo‚Äù that we just came from Madrid and I was falling in love with Vermouth.  His eyes light up and said : we do , I can make some for you ! 
I was like : you sure? I don‚Äôt see it on your station . 
Pablo: wait,  I‚Äôll get it for you ! 
Then he went out his way and came back with the bottle and made a vermouth for me and also made sure is the way I wanted. 
Now that‚Äôs called excellent customer service ! 
Customer service is about experience detail . 
We just stayed in Thompson Madrid and we didn‚Äôt get that kind of service, they were too busy to pay attention on the customer experience detail !",4,2024,10,12
30,Wish we could have stayed longer‚Ä¶,A great stay. Alan was very helpful and accommodating during our stay. The rooms were very spacious and breakfast had a great selection.

30,Wonderful front desk experience,"The front desk receptionist (Abria) was wonderful.   She was so warm and welcoming.  I know I can be a little high maintenance but she was very patient and accommodating.  She was very friendly even before finding out I had globalist status.  I would definitely come back here again.  

I travel quite a bit for business and this time I was traveling for leisure with my family and appreciated how they took care of us.",5,2024,10,12
30,Review of anniversary stay at the Hyatt.,"We were amazed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The cleanliness, size and stylish room exceeded our expectations.

30,Great stay!,"Our stay was just 2 nights in Barcelona but we were pleased with the hotel. It‚Äôs clean, staff are friendly and the location is convenient with regard to public transportation. We upgraded to be able to utilize the Regency Club for drinks/happy hour and breakfast. We directly interacted with a guest specialist named Ani. She was sweet, pleasant, helpful and accommodating. We met her on the first night, when we were not sure if we would book a second night and she sealed the deal! Because her level of attentiveness, we decided to stay the second night even though the price was higher. We had decided that with customer service like hers, it was worth the extra money. Also, shout out to front door and registration staff upon our arrival, they were also helpful and friendly.",5,2024,10,09

30,Over all great place to stay,"The breakfast was fantastic, Staff were very friendly.
The rooms are very neat and clean with very comfy pillows.
Room service staff are very careful about your privacy.

30,Outstanding Service,"Facilities, accommodations, and amenities were great‚Ä¶.given that, what stood out as exceptional was the service. 
From the start at check in, Marcella was very helpful in correcting some reservation issues. From there, every step of the way, all of our needs were taken care of. A special shout to Paulo at the club, who made sure we always had a fresh cocktail.
The entire staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy and taken care of.",5,2024,10,08
30,GREAT Service with Smiles,"The wait service was EXCELLENT.  Carmen started us off at the bar with a light dinner and glass of wine, smiling and assisting us with deciding which wine and food we‚Äôd like.  The food arrived hot, the wine was good, just an overall pleasant experience.  The next morning was breakfast with Mercedes, again smiling and ensuring I had hot coffee.  Carlotta came to ask if my breakfast was as I preferred.  This Hyatt is doing a stellar job with service training and the vibe at the restaurants/bars is excellent.  Thank you for an excellent overnight in Barcelona.",5,2024,10,07

30,Great staff,"My wife and I had a great time at this hotel.  The location was very convenient, a 5 minute walk to the train station so it was very easy to get to all the main attractions in the city.
There was an excellent breakfast in the morning and if you signed up for the club lounge there were very good tapas, wine and beer in the evening.
There‚Äôs a small gym in the basement and full sized gym next door which I think costs 15 euros for a pass.  The gym in the basement could use some heavier dumbells.
The best thing about this hotel was the staff.  I travel internationally on business and Maria, Ivan, Pablo, and Jordi were probably the best that I have had the pleasure of meeting.",5,2024,10,05
30,Great place to Stay,"The bed and pillows are comfortable. Nice room with great view, the service is great and people in the reception and restaurant are helpful and friendly.

30,Great stay,"Great hotel for a work trip. Not much around the actual hotel, but a 30 minute ride on the metro into main areas, metro is a 5 min walk away. The staff are very helpful, thanks to Ivan who went out of his way to help. Breakfast was brilliant and so was the restaurant food. Overall great stay.",5,2024,10,03
30,Best Airport Hotel I've Ever Stayed At,This hotel is fantastic for a night before/after the airport. The staff is very helpful and friendly. We stayed in the Junior Suite and it was spacious and clean. Food options mean you never have to leave the hotel if you don't want to; which is good because there really isn't anything in walking distance. Taxi's are at the ready for any transportation needs. Beds were comfy and shower was awesome. The elevators are bit confusing but you'll figure it out eventually.,5,2024,10,01
30,Breakfast at the Hyatt,"Our experience was fabulous. My family and I went to the restaurant for breakfast. The lady that received us was so helpful. She was also very pleasant and had a lovely smile. The food was good on top of that. Was a most enjoyable experience.

The staff down stairs amazing and very helpful with a big shout to Sebi in breakfast for his consistent smile and helpful attitude. 
Hyatt with those staff big tick please put milk in rooms and free water as the idea of no water coming from airport and paying 6 eur 
Regardless thank you staff.",2,2024,09,29
30,Amazing experience ,"We arrived at the hotel after a l8ng day of travel and were having a horrible day. We  visited Terrum for dinner, and we were transformed!  The customer service delivered by Ali was impeccable. He is knowledgeable. about the menu and the food was delicious. Thank you, Ali, for being you!",5,2024,09,27
30,Beautiful Stay in Barcelona,"This is the 3rd time I visited Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower. Hotel is great from outside and amazing inside. Lobby is beautiful with the infused water provided. Room is clean and comfortable. I love how the housekeeping hang the bath robe together with the slippers and provides such a complete amenities. Front Office team are amazing, every time I need some information they will find for me very fast and with smile. Cheers to Imen & Virginia, they are so helpful. I want also want to highlight the Breakfast Spot, Azimut Restaurante. The buffet was amazing, thank you for being generous to us. The fruit cut in big pieces, oatmeal porridge in buffet, lactose free & gluten free items, Bloody Mary station and fresh orang juice. Croissant is superb! Thank you for the Chefs & team. All staffs really friendly & helpful and always ask what I need during my breakfast. The hostess, Lucia and Eva the server, they are amazing. Thank you Hyatt Regency for the great great experience.

30,The Staff Really Makes This Property,"The staff really makes this property special.  The property itself is a little off the beaten path - don‚Äôt expect to go out and walk a couple of blocks to find food, drinks, or tourist spots. However, it is super convenient to the subway, which allows easy access to anywhere in Barcelona. I am a Globalist with Hyatt, and typically get excellent service, but this property went way beyond my expectations. They gave me a great room and welcome amenity and provided great service. Special shoutout to Ani (club lounge), Maria (concierge), and Jordi (GM). They truly made our stay fantastic!!",5,2024,09,26
30,Great experience,"The hotel is well maintained, and staff are very friendly and helpful. Maria at the service desk was very helpful and patience, followed up our inquires thoroughly. ",5,2024,09,23
30,Nice hotel,"Pros - Nice hotel, located near airport (by taxi it is approx 20‚Ç¨ to the hotel).
Good breakfast, good coffee.
Very good view to the city from 24th floor.
Advanced level of services (especially guest relations - Ani is absolutely best!).
Cons - maybe needs a little renovation.",4,2024,09,23
30,Great and convenient facility with wonderful staff.,"My wife and I visited Barcelona and stayed at the Hyatt Regency. Besides the hotel cleanness, great Regency Club & Restaurants, fantastic amenities, close to metro stations. And near by workout facility, I was most impressed with warm and welcoming staff. They were extremely courteous and helpful. I can‚Äôt help myself to mention Miss Carlota Martinez for her wonderful suggestion to visit sites and nearby towns. If it wasn‚Äôt for her list of sites/towns to visit, we would have missed many wonderful places. Than you sincerely.",5,2024,09,22
30,Great experience!,The service was great and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Location was convenient to the metro. Ani and Marie were exceptionally and great at their jobs. I would highly recommend this location and will choose it next time I am in the country.,5,2024,09,22
30,"Hidden gem, I was truly impressed with this hotel","This hotel was an unexpected surprise, the moment you walk in you will notice how clean and tranquil it is, you will be greeted by the most friendly and welcoming staff. Food, Rooms, service and there attention to details will definitely impress you.",5,2024,09,22
30,Fantastic view of the city,"Check in was smooth and fast. I am an Explorist and was pleasantly surprised to find out that my room has been upgraded to a suite. The suite was really nice with a view of the city you would die for. The night view, from the 24 floor was fantastic, especially while lying in bed at night. The food was nice in the Club Access. The only complaint I would have is that the room seem to be under the night club and you could hear the thumping base. Front desk provided me with ear plugs. Would definitely recommend staying here.",4,2024,09,21
30,Friendly Service and wonderful bartender ( Charlie),"Charlie, the bartender at the Axis Bar was outstanding.  The drinks he made were fantastic and he had such a great personality.  He was extremely outgoing and provider service with a smile.  In my opinion, he is rated 10 out of 10 for customer service.",5,2024,09,20
30,Best experience in Barcelona,"Charlie in Axis bar and restaurant explained all the meal options and drinks.  His service was incredible and was very customer oriented. Americans ask for Charlie he will take good care of you.  
Maria our guest relations manager made sure we were very conveniently checked in. She checked on us 3 times after to make sure we were taken care of by staff. She also made recommendations of places to see and do.  
Cudos the staff at the Hyatt because they were relentless in making the customers feel welcome and at home.  Five stars to Hyatt",5,2024,09,20
30,Better than expected,"Very Welcoming, wow effect.
I had an amazing experience in the hotel, specially with the staff service - reception and guest service (doorbell young man).

30,"Great hotel , don‚Äôt order room service","Great hotel, however a bit out of town , beautiful rooms with great views and they were  spotlessly clean .
Attentive and caring staff who would do anything to help.
Breakfast was great. 
The only let down was room service , menu was very limited and what I had was terrible",4,2024,09,19
30,Highly recommended,"Very nice hotel and service, especially at breakfast buffet.
Friendly staff
Nice gym
Nice business facilities
Overall very good experience with this hotel.
Close to the airport
Highly recommend to people visiting Barcelona
Only negative side is that it‚Äôs far to the city",5,2024,09,19
30,The Hyatt Regency at the Barcelona Tower was fantastic!,The suite was large and spacious. Had a very warm and luxurious feel. The customer service at the front desk was spectacular. Specifically Maite did a fantastic job of making us feel welcome and getting us settled into our room. I would highly recommend anybody to come visit this hotel.,5,2024,09,18
30,Help to find a lost wallet,"When I lost my wallet in the taxi upon arrival from the airport, the whole front of house staff were fantastic in trying to help me locate and retrieve my wallet, including the front desk and also the luggage team. Arnau and Catalina particularly were the ones who dealt with my issue, contacting the taxi company and arranging for them to redeliver my wallet, keeping me informed throughout my stay. I cannot praise the front of house staff enough, they truly went above and beyond what was expected. 

Furthermore, the breakfast was exceptional quality, and the food from the bar in the lobby was surprisingly good for bar food. Overall the quality of service and food was exceptional, worthy of 5 star hotel.",5,2024,09,18
30,Disappointed,"Currently staying at the hotel and unfortunately have another night and just wish I was home.  Booked and paid for a king bed to be given a twin room, after a battle I was finally moved to a king room albeit an accessible room and it stinks of smoke it‚Äôs so overpowering you can taste it on your lips.  

This is my fourth year here and I will never return.",2,2024,09,18
30,Excellent staff!,"I had a lovely stay at the Hyatt and Maisie was incredibly helpful at reception. She made sure I had everything I needed and was well taken care of.

The room was very lovely and had an absolutely stunning view of the city! I very much look forward to returning in the future.",5,2024,09,17
30,Excellent Customer Service,"My flight from Barcelona to Menorca was cancelled due to weather, so after spending 8hrs in the airport, I had to stay in town so I could take the ferry the next day. Kevin at the World of Hyatt desk was extremely helpful and very empathetic to my situation. He helped book me on the ferry the next day, give me local recommendations and upgraded me to a suite to help make my day less terrible. 

I‚Äôve always been loyal to Hyatt hotels and this was just another example of why I keep coming back.",5,2024,09,17
30,Skip it.,"Skip this property. We stayed for a night before the airport and its horribly outdated. The shower door leaked on the floor into the hallway. The staff was nice, and the food was just acceptable. Traffic area was very difficult to maneuver and access the parking.",2,2024,09,16
30,Best Hyatt Regency experience,"I have stayed at over 10 different Hyatt regencies and at least 20+ Hyatt properties overall. This stay by far was the best experience I have have. The staff went above and beyond with everything, including getting a suite ready early (arrived on a 7am cruise), sending goodies to the room, checking in on how we were doing, etc, etc. Granted, I do have status with Hyatt, but this has been the best I have been treated at any hotel. I cannot recommend this hotel more!!",5,2024,09,16
30,Highly recommended,"Excellent facility and service.  Beautiful Tapas and excellent complimentary wine at Hyatt club. Near convention center, so not in city center but Metro station adjacent , so easy to get around. One issue is a disco club next door. Bring ear plugs if your room is faced in that direction. Otherwise, highly recommended.",5,2024,09,15
30,Wonderfully personalized stay.,What an enjoyable and personalized stay I received.  I was traveling to Barcelona from NYC as part of my Honeymoon. The team at Hyatt was quick to acknowledge the special occasion and made us feel very welcome. The views from our Loft Suite were breathtaking. The room itself was spotless and well maintained. The team also went out of their way to deliver strawberries and champagne! Every team member I encountered was in positive moods and went out of their way to greet us and make sure our stay was enjoyable.,5,2024,09,14
30,Great Experience,Spacious rooms. Check in process was smooth. Maite at the front desk was lovely and gave us a good overview of the room. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The host was warm. A lot of different variety of food to choose from. ,5,2024,09,14
30,Great hotel for families with lots of amenities without breaking the bank,"We had such a great experience at this hotel. We were on a 10 day Porto/Lisbon/Barcelona vacation. This hotel was on our last leg and it was our kids favorite. Check in was done by *Aaron who was so pleasant, and attentive. He was just great and the young man tending the entrance; can't remember his name but he was awesome - maybe Javier was his name...? both so welcoming. We booked a 2 room, family suite (1 king and 2 twins) and were so happy with our connecting rooms and all the space; because it is not close to the city center, it cheaper than other hotels close to city center so we got 2 rooms or a family suite. As many have mentioned, the breakfast is pretty special and service was top notch. 

I was concerned about the distance because a few people mentioned it on the reviews but we are from Los Angeles where everything is so spread out that we were willing to travel/commute. However, unlike L.A., Barcelona's public transportation is much better and far more efficient and so we rode the metro during our entire stay. We purchased a multi-trip, family metro pass and used it for all 4 of us. We just scanned one at a time. If transfer is needed, no need to pay again, as transfer are done within metro station. The station is right next door at the university/medical school. 

Because we were traveling with children, we opted for a taxi from airport which was pretty reasonably, just ask for taxi meter. Our taxi driver quoted us $30 but I said no, and asked for taximeter to be on; meter said $22; not bad for door-to-door service for a family of 4 with multiple bags. Honestly the ""distance"" was not a problem at all. It's literally 18 minutes more or less from airport by taxi and 20 minutes to city center by metro (about $10 for 8 trips).  I am already thinking about going back and staying here and perhaps renting a car for a day and take a day trip to other nearby cities since driving in this area seemed pretty easy and not hectic like city center. Thank you Aaron and Hyatt Barcelona Tower for a great and memorable stay.",5,2024,09,03
30,Amazing,Customer Servive was hands down the best I e encountered We will definitely stay here next time. USA should take lessons because Europe is hands down the best! Breakfast was amazing and the 29 floor bar was amazing with 360 views of the city. Thank you!,5,2024,09,03
30,Recomended,"The hotel was modern,clean and comfortable. Staff wss very helpful especially Any , she was amazing and good guidance , metro was near the hotel which make location good as its not in the center, in genearl it was very good experience and can be recomended",4,2024,09,01
30,Another fabulous stay in Barcelona,"Another fabulous stay at the Hyatt Towers, Barcelona. The hotel is lovely and fresh and clean. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. All of the staff is so professional and friendly.Arnau checked us in with ease, and was very helpful with our many questions. This is our second stay, and it will always be our go to property in Barcelona.",5,2024,09,01
30,Great drinks,"Charlie (no E) aka Carlos the bartender was freaking awesome. He‚Äôs the man! Definitely recommend the lobby bar.

The Skyfall lounge was fully reserved so we couldn‚Äôt experience that. But the views were dope. 

The gym leaves a lot to be desired but I think that‚Äôs because the Metropolitan Fitness and Spa is attached to hotel.",5,2024,08,31
30,Birthday stay,"My stay started with a rough start but that was quickly resolved. A special thank you to Matt (front desk), another gentleman I didn‚Äôt pick his name but was a bell boy and does the early morning shifts and Maria (guest experience). They were very professional and helpful all the way. Maria went above and beyond to ensure I had a lovely birthday celebration and accommodated my room change request. Really thankful for this üòä

The only point I did make as improvement is around communication amongst the hotel staff. I was told I could check out late for 2pm instead of 12pm and at no charge. Which was greatly appreciated however a man came banging on my door multiple times at past 12pm saying I need to check out and because I have stayed longer it will be charged. I was shocked. I calmly explained to him there must be a mistake or miscommunication and he needed to check with his team. He left without an apology for the mix up. This man was shown to the staff when I was checking out later. Hopefully he was spoken to. Going forward just keep your communications stable to avoid such incidents again.",4,2024,08,30
30,Great value using points!,I have returned to the Hyatt Loyalty program and I've been impressed.  Points have more value on overseas destinations!,4,2024,08,29
30,Great experience in Fuego restaurant of the hotel,"The Fuego restaurant of the hotel was a great experience and we had a delicious meal. The perfect hotel in all aspects, with spacious and clean and comfortable rooms, very friendly staff, fells like home away from home. We will come back many times again.",5,2024,08,29
30,It was wonderful stay!,Hotel is brand new. Beautiful. Breakfast is delicious. View was amazing! Everything was awesome. It was my birthday and I received champagne and cake from the hotel!,5,2024,08,26
30,It Just Doesn't Get Any Better!,"My wife and I recently celebrated my 70th birthday with a weeklong stay at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower and I can't even describe how great the entire staff was in helping to make the occasion special.  I had called Hyatt reservations to use one of the Suite Upgrades in my account and the agent I spoke with asked if I would be  celebrating any special occasion and I mentioned my birthday, so she noted the reservation, accordingly.  

We arrived in Barcelona very early after an overnight flight and when we got to the  hotel, it almost seemed like they knew who I was when I walked through the door and they were making preparations to make sure I had a great birthday celebration. Marina at the front desk, got things started by wishing me a happy birthday and then thanking me for choosing the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower for my celebration. Unfortunately, because we arrived so early the Suite wasn't available, which we understood, but she assured me that they would expedite the cleaning after the guest occupying the room checked out so they could get us into the room as soon as possible.  Fortunately, this hotel has a spacious Regency Club where we relaxed during the wait, which was only a couple of hours. While we waited, Maria in Guest Services (who was an absolute gem) would occasionally pop in to keep us appraised of when the room would be ready, to see if we needed anything and to make sure we were comfortable.  I have to say that she is a wonderful asset to the hotel who excels at customer service and she was an excellent resource throughout our stay.

When the room was ready, Maria brought our keys to the Regency Club and sent Mariano, one of the bellmen, up with our luggage. He was a breath of fresh air-very personable and kept us laughing while he walked us through how everything worked in the room.  We saw him several times during the week and each time he would ask what our plans were, where we were going and give us advice on how to get there and make suggestions of other things in vicinity that we may want to check out. 

As far as the hotel goes, it's not as new and modern as some other luxury hotels I've stayed in, but the common areas and the rooms are clean and well maintained, the beds are comfortable, rooms are cleaned and amenities are replenished daily and I would say that the hotel is still in great shape.  Because it's located on the outskirts of Barcelona, it's in an area that's very quiet, safe for walking or jogging and within a 5 minute walk to the Metro, which we used a few times to go into the city and it worked great. 

Oh, and I can't forget to offer compliments to Emmanuel Vincent, the Food & Beverage Director, on the outstanding breakfast buffet.  Since I traveled extensively on business before I retired, I've stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years and never seen a spread as extensive as the one here.  To some extent, it was the highlight of the day or definitely something to look forward to and a great way to start your day.   Hats off to the staff in the restaurant for insuring that the buffet was constantly replenished and especially to Gerard, who was constantly monitoring the tables and keeping everyone's coffee cup filled.  

Unfortunately, I didn't get everyone's name whom we interfaced with during our stay but you were all wonderful and are the reason that the Hotel gets such glowing reviews, which was my reason for choosing this hotel over others in Barcelona. We will be back!",5,2024,08,25
30,All That,"Amazing place, but better yet, amazing team. The entire day crew busts their * to make you happy, especially David, who's always there for you with good advice, a helping hand y una sonrisa. Nothing that you ask is too much, and he and the gang make you want to come back again and again. Good times.",5,2024,08,21
30,Amazing experience,"Ali was the best waiter at the restaurant! Super friendly and could explain everything very well! Food also tasted amazing , you can choose between indoors and outdoors terrace sitings, which both came with a different menu! I would definitely recommend the menu for 2 people as it came with a steak grill and in total it kept me very full:)",5,2024,08,21
30,Happy stay with my family.,Me and my family have a wonderful time in the hotel. We enjoyed our trip. Breakfast was very good. Rooms were nice and clean. Great city view from the rooms.,5,2024,08,20
30,Stay at Hyatt Barcelona,"Mark at reception was brilliant and Ali and Carlos in the restaurant make the experience great. The food was also excellent. I stay at the Hyatt in Barcelona regularly because of the great staff like Mark. I will
Be back again soon. Thanks you to all the Hyatt staff",5,2024,08,20
30,Loved Everything,The hotel is beautiful and the staff was awesome.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable. I highly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay there again.  I don't want to stay anywhere else lol,5,2024,08,19
30,Amazing experience,The restaurant was wonderful Ali our server had amazing recommendations the passion fruit mojito was amazing per his suggestion such a amazing experience will be coming to stay at the Hyatt Barcelona again very soon! The staff was so friendly,5,2024,08,17
30,Good Stay,"Stayed here for one night before a cruise. The hotel itself is nice, although we had to wait about 10 minutes to check in because only two employees were tending to the front desk. Probably could use some more staff to tend to the guests because as we were waiting, more people came in and the line was almost out the door. We stayed on the 22nd floor and the hotel did not appear to be too busy. We had access to the regency club since it was part of our membership. Breakfast was good, except for the eggs which were really undercooked and runny. Only downside was that the fire alarm went off around 2:00 AM and everyone had to evacuate. They never located the source of the burning smell and the fire department never responded. Overall, the hotel is in a good location and about a five minute walk to the metro.",4,2024,08,15
30,Outstanding experience!,"We had an outstanding experience from everyone on the staff from the manager, the guest relations individual, the young men who helped us with luggage and other items with which we needed some help and the waiters in the Axis restaurant! The staff in the club did everything to help us as did the serving staff at the breakfast. We couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Hyatt is so lucky to have such a wonderful team in which all individuals excel.",5,2024,08,14
30,Nice hotel and service,We had a fabulous day highly recommend the next time we come to Barcelona we will definitely stay here.,5,2024,08,10
30,Do Not Stay Here! Ceilings Are Leaking EVERYWHERE,"I was trying to avoid posting this review because I thought my incident was an isolated incident and that the hotel was going to professionally and properly handle it; however, due to their lack of due diligence here I am. 

I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower from July 17-21. On my very first night there, the night of the 17th, there was a leak from one of the lights in the bathroom area. The morning of the 18th I called the front desk to report the leak. Over an hour and a 1/2 went by and no one came to fix the leak. I called back multiple times and still no response. Eventually someone responded and they sent someone to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the leak. Two men came and said that they fixed the leak and the leak would stop in an hour, and they left. I had to call back down to the front desk for them to send house keeping to clean up the water on my bathroom floor.

Fast forward to the evening of the 18th, I returned to my room only to see that the leak had spread and there was a huge water bubble on the bathroom ceiling that was leaking in addition to the original leak that was coming from the light. Once again I contact the front desk, they sent someone up, the man busted the water bubble (hence the patch work in my pictures) and told me the leak would stop in an hour. One of the hotel managers brought us a card apologizing and some chocolate. We were still not allowed to changed rooms. 

I had to take the garbage cans in the room and put them under the leaks to avoid slipping and falling. The leak continues for the remainder of our stay. It wasn‚Äôt until our very last night that we got a letter from the front desk stating that we can changed rooms due to a pipe break in our room. However, we were gone all day and didn‚Äôt see the letter until 11pm that night. Due to the fact that we were checking out early the next morning, we did not change rooms. 

I spoke to numerous managers throughout my stay and they continued to apologize and promised me a full refund. To this date, they have not issued me a refund and have been ignoring my calls and my credit company‚Äôs calls (I booked through a credit card portal). 

I am very disappointed in Director of Operations IV√ÅN CASTRO NOVOA, 
 General Manager JORDI MIR, Guest Relations YOMARY POLANCO, in addition to Manager MARIEL who all promised me that they would handle this and give me a full refund and did not. At this point they said anything they needed too because they knew I did not live there to follow up.

I will continue to follow up and post this review EVERYWHERE until the hotel responds. You all know who I am and you know what I went through during my stay, do the right thing and respond to our calls and emails and give me the refund I was promised!",1,2024,08,07
30,A wonderful Barcelona visit,"This hotel is lovely.  The staff is outstanding. In particular the concierge Maria Rosell! She was so helpful when we  asked for help in planning our itinerary. My wife and I were celebrating our 30th anniversary. Maria took care of us as if she was related to us. It made us feel welcomed and appreciated as customers. This kind of treatment is rare and should be recognized. The hotel itself is well run, has an upscale modern feel, and is located in a nice area. The downtown Barcelona area is easily accessible. The breakfast service was the perfect way to start your day. It was our first time in Barcelona. We would definitely use this hotel again.",5,2024,08,07
30,Great Experience,"Hyatt Regency Hesperia Barcelona Towers restaurant was especially lovely. We enjoyed their bbq/grilled sea bass with salad, peppers, and fries.  Delicious mock mimosa. Chocolate mousse for dessert. Perfecto! Our server Ali was expecially gracious and accommodating. It was truly a wonderful experience. Highly recommend!",5,2024,08,04
30,Excellent staff that put the guests on the first place without compromise. Really well managed hotel which stands out.,"Some things went wrong, we had some bad luck. It was unfortunate. Some things are hard to influence as a hotel and the electricity can break down, there can be a smoke alarm - it‚Äôs all very disruptive and can cause dissatisfaction. But I think the staff and people that work here are excellent. Absolutely without a doubt - they are the top notch people you want there to manage any unplanned situations. The hotel directors walked around and helped and I felt like this was the most important thing. Empathy, efficiency and trying their best. That‚Äôs what stands out so much. So my big kudos and hats off to the staff that managed everything and the hotel management also. It‚Äôs all about how the problems are solved, because there will always be issues. And this hotel will always take care of their guests and prioritise that as number one. 
We also really valued their attentiveness during my husbands birthday, they decorated the room and made it a very nice moment. 
We left a bit disturbed by some bad luck as mentioned but at peace because we were helped and treated very well by every person that worked there, from customer relations to reception, to the luggage helpers to the hotel directors. We would come back.",4,2024,08,02
30,A return guest experience,"A great repeat stay!  A big thanks to a few people: Anthony from the bell staff for ALWAYS having a big smile and working hard to ensure we're enjoying our stay. Next, Malike from housekeeping who kept our suite impeccable, to Eva and Sebi who provided an excellent service at breakfast and lastly, Yomary and Maria from guest relations who took note of my comments in regards to our suite.
I genuinely appreciate everyone's effort to provide a great service.",5,2024,07,29
30,Mosquitoes in rooms,Room had several mosquitoes buzzing around...was bitten all night and could not sleep! Changed room next day to another higher floor and there were mosquitoes in that room too...was fortunate did not get malaria!! Horrible experience!!!,1,2024,07,28
30,Outstanding customer service,Carlos did an amazing job of making me a drink for a non drinker. Outstanding service all around at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower. We will be back again and stay at the Hyatt Regency. The Regency Club has also been amazing and the staff as well.,5,2024,07,26
30,Surprisingly cool spot in an old tower hotel.,"Far from the city center, but a really cool hotel in a well designed building with a circular bar on the 26th floor. Large rooms and very comfortable. Wasn‚Äôt expecting to enjoy this hotel as much as I did ;) ",5,2024,07,25
30,Barcelona Tower,"We stayed here after getting off our cruise. It was convenient for the port and the airport. It was also convenient for the Metro and we were able to get in and out of the city easily. Great staff, wonderful breakfast. Nice Club. ",5,2024,07,19
30,Exceptional breakfast team,"First time staying in this hotel. Arrived for a five night stay. Would to especially note the exceptional service received at breakfast especially by Fernando and Eva. In addition to the great selection and quality of items, they made our experience extra special.",5,2024,07,19
30,Lovely 5 star Hotel,"Lovely h√¥tel very clean all around  - Breakfast staff (Fernando) went above and beyond for us, making custom breakfast which wasn‚Äôt on menu.. Amazing clean rooms that expected from a 5star.. Hotel is Very close to metro trains to explore rest of Barcelona.. 
I would book again compared to the rest ü•≥üôåüèº",5,2024,07,19
30,"Convenient location, modern accommodations, and excellent customer service","This hotel is located outside of the city. However, the red subway line is very close to the hotel. The subway is clean, air conditioned, and easy to navigate. 

The rooms in the hotel were very spacious, modern, and clean. Everyone on our group was quite happy with the accommodations. 

The hotel staff was exceptional. Everyone that I interacted with was very helpful, kind, and welcoming. Carmen, Nacho, and Fernando treated our family so well in the restaurants during our stay. Tony, the bell hop was very helpful in organizing our transportation, and I also appreciate, Maria from guest services for checking in on us and making sure that we had a pleasant stay. 

It is also worth noting that the pool was quite refreshing after a hot day.",5,2024,07,17
30,Haven in Barcelona - Great Hotel,"My stay at Hyatt Barcelona Tower was impeccable. The hotel's location is perfect, just 10 minutes from the airport and a short taxi ride to the city center. The spacious, well-equipped hotel offers all the amenities expected from a five-star Hyatt. The attentive staff and gracious housekeeping made my stay even more enjoyable. I appreciated the on-site gym and pool, which were excellent for staying active. The gym is well-equipped with everything needed for a good workout. The Regency Club is expansive and offers a variety of items. Lastly, the rooms are spacious and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again.",5,2024,07,16

30,Amazing stay and customer services,Amazing stay and customer services. The process of checkin was easy and staff was very helpful. I would definitely recommend.,5,2024,07,15
30,Poor experience,"Having extensively stayed in Hyatt regencies around the world I still can‚Äôt believe that the Hyatt Regency Barcelona tower is this brand of Hotel. The check-in experience was dreadfully slow, when we die dialled down for room service we were told it would take over an hour for two club sandwiches. The room smelt like a smokers room despite the fact that we asked for no smoking, and the bedding felt damp. Somebody had clearly tried to open the electronic curtains and had broken several of the curtain hooks so the curtains were literally hanging off.

All in all very disappointing Hotel , horrible part of Barcelona. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel. ",1,2024,07,15
30,Great place to stay,You will not be disappointed by staying at this location.  I highly recommend it for your Barcelona stay.,5,2024,07,14
30,Amazing breakfast! Superb room - top-notch service.,"This is a wonderful hotel. From the moment we arrived, we felt special by the superb room and top-notch service. Every detail was perfect, and we felt comfortable and well taken care of. The manager on site was on top of all the details, we often see him walking around and making sure the hotel was in great shape and that everyone was satisfied. And the breakfast? Absolutely amazing! It was the perfect start to our days.
We've stayed at various Hyatt locations, including some in Asia, but this experience has been our best stay ever.",5,2024,07,14
30,Convenient and Comfortable,"The Hyatt is a great place to stay the night before an early flight. It's close to the airport and a taxi is easily available. A taxi to the airport is about 25 euros. The room was comfortable as well. Our only critique is the mirrored walls in the bathroom, there's just too many mirrors :)  The restaurant (Terrum) had a ""Foodie"" type menu, which we loved. It was absolutely delicious, and the service was flawless.  I would not suggest it for a family with children though as there area not many child-friendly choices. ",5,2024,07,14
30,Beware room upgrades,"Paid $300 for a suite with a view.  Suite was lovely, but the 7th floor only has a view of the neighboring apartments!  Executive lounge service was great but the lobby bar was curt and argumentative when we returned the Margherita pizza - tomato sauce and cheese was well below our expectations of food quality at a Hyatt Regency.",1,2024,07,12
30,Beautiful Barcelona,"I personally feel that this hotel with all their staff is perfect for a trip to visit Barcelona. 
This is a beautiful hotel. Very comfortable. 
The location was very good. I like to be able to use metros, taxi and other local transportation. It‚Äôs all right here. Close to cruise lines and airports. I will come back.",5,2024,07,11
30,great ending to a cruise,Hotel was lovely though a bit out of the way. Close to Metro so we learned our way around.  Hoped for concierge which we kept being told was in a meeting or not available.  Another staff member said there was no concierge.  ,5,2024,07,09
30,An oasis away from the busy Center,"An oasis in busy Barcelona. 

Peak season in Barcelona comes with its challenges. Full restaurants, bad service. 

Forget it‚Äôs make your way to the Hyatt and have a wonderful dinner away from the city!

Eat at their restaurant. Nuria will treat you to the best dishes",5,2024,07,08
30,Pay the extra for the city magical city view,The pillow menu is appreciated. The room is spotless and all details are considered including slippers. The atmosphere of the lobby is welcoming and a haven for the senses. The view of the city from the higher city facing room is awe inspiring. Close to the airport and a quick 16 Euro taxi ride. Public bus and sub are within a stones throw.,5,2024,07,02
30,A excellent experience,"A excellent experience. Ali one of the very kind waiter at this location had lovely menu suggestions. The atmosphere was well thought out with excellent music to accompany the meal. The Iberian pork served atop mashed sweat potatoes and crispy kale was very flavourful and delicious, as well as the chocolate dome was a fabulous treat to finish the meal. Overall an excellent experience.",5,2024,07,02

Animated chef was a wonderful surprise and made us all laugh together 
We celebrated our anniversary among strangers that became friends 
Thank you to the excellent service and fun",5,2024,06,30
30,Not worth it,"It was not worth the price. The room is nice, but beds are quite uncomfortable. That said we did feel safe and it‚Äôs super close to the airport (the main reason we stayed). The pool definitely not worth it the parking garage goes under it so that was strange. I also felt as if they are trying to squeeze money out of you. We wanted a simple meal they have a market you can get food from but the menu and prices we not advertised as well as how you pay ( go get someone from the bar). Over all the convenience of the airport is amazing but everything else made me not want to stay there again.",3,2024,06,30
30,"Gorgeous rooms, hotel and views!","The hotel is gorgeous!!! The rooms are beautiful and very clean. This was part of our honeymoon stop so we chose a lovely loft room with panoramic view on the 15th floor.
The breakfast bar is delicious with so many options! We ate at almost all the restaurants here and they all were superb. We even went all the way up to the 29th floor to enjoy the Dinner Show at Skyfall.

The hotel is closer to the airport which is nice, but it is further away from the city to explore. The Uber we took to downtown/La Rambla was about 22‚Ç¨ and from there the Hop On/Off bus took us all over town.

We asked for an extended check out to enjoy the room since it was so cozy and the views were amazing. We would definitely visit again!",5,2024,06,30
30,Nice place but remote,"Hotel is nice, room was nice and staff was friendly.  Great breakfast and the Club room is good with complimentary beer, wine sodas and juice all day. Only drawback is location. 30 minute metro to e City center. Metro is very close to the hotel  only problem is there is really nothing walkable from the hotel besides an amazing little family run pizza place 10 minutes away  highly recommend!  We cut our stay on night short, for our points back and spent a couple nights right downtown.",4,2024,06,29
30,GREAT!!!,"Location was perfect next to metro. We could go to any part of the city in just a five minute walk to the metro. The staff and concierge were eager to help and even made suggestions for our sight seeing days. Fernando, Lucia and Lia were always cheerful and a pleasure during our breakfast. They even served me a birthday treat at breakfast with a candle and singing. Malika in housekeeping was efficient and cheerful. It‚Äôs the person touches that meant so much. We stayed a week and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend.",5,2024,06,27
30,Experience at Hyatt Regency Barvelona Towers,The check in was quite efficient. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The pillows are very soft and comfortable.

30,10/10 experience,"My and my friend went to the SpanishGP and chose Hyatt Regency as our residency. The room (great view over all of Barcelona), service and food was just incredible as well as the whole hotel staff.

30,Poorly managed property with no hot water,We checked in and it was very nice.  Then we get to the room and there is no hot water.  I called down and asked and was told yes about half the rooms are without hot water.  We will have it looked at tomorrow after 7am.  Nothing like cold showers when you arrive late.  No warning in the lobby and when I asked why we weren't told the night staff said I would have to talk to management.  He did say they were full and weren't giving any compensation.  I guess I wasn't the first to call down about cold water.  Good thing we opted to skip the breakfast after reading those reviews here in the room.,1,2024,06,21
30,Great room and view until you step outside!,"Stayed one night.  New Hyatt member.  Check in was great.  Room was on point with great view.  Easy access to airport.  However, I paid for my wife and I to have breakfast and it was terrible.  Soupy eggs, fried eggs were all half cooked; bread was stale and rest was seriously lacking in taste and flavor.  Deserve a refund for that.  The gym was a joke.  In the dungeon; with ceiling piping and no ventilation and little machines.  YOur telling me that size of hotel with all those views can't find a suitable room for an up to date gym.  Pathetic.",3,2024,06,21
30,Food Menus in all the restaurants were limited.  Breakfast was excellent ! Staff was very courteous and attentive!,"The black floors near Lifts were very misleading. You feel like you are going fall when you get close to the lift from the carpet! Illusion is too much üôÑ
Same situation even in the rooms with black floors and walls! 
Comfortable beds, pillows and the towels!",3,2024,06,18
30,Ver Nice Hotel and Staff,"Enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel. Metro station is right outside and took it to downtown. Room is well appointed and spacious.

30,THIEVES PREY ON HOTEL GUESTS,"I would not stay at this hotel again. I had my luggage and backpack next me in the hotel lobby. I checked my phone to see flight details and my bags were gone. The hotel management says it happens. It's not the first time it's happened. They said they have video footage and I should go to the police dept and file a police report. In other words, the hotel mgt basically said it's my problem and I need to talk to the police and deal with it. The only help hotel mgt gave me was calling a cab to take me to the police office. The Hyatt brand name implies a high standard of care for guests. This hotel does not live up to the Hyatt name and I would not stay there again.",1,2024,06,10

I landed in Barcelona after a 9-hour flight earlier than expected and they were able to find me a room and check me in earlier. They made the check in process easy and were extremely helpful. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and has modern amenities. It is far from the touristy areas but its an easy metro/bus ride to them. I had a great experience at the Hotel and will be recommending it!,5,2024,06,06

30,Premium Experience that Exceeded Our Expectations,"Barcelona was the last leg of my family's last-minute spring Europe trip, and of all the hotels that we booked, I was most excited for the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower just based on the pictures of the room/hotel, amenities offered by the hotel, and the large size of the rooms relative to the usual European standard size. We had booked two rooms for our family of four.

After our stay, I can say this hotel more than exceeded the high expectations I already had going into this experience. To keep it simple, I'm breaking down our stay between the highlights and areas for improvement.

Highlights:
1) Staff and the service are extremely polished, professional, and courteous. From the receptionists to housekeeping to restaurant staff, everyone was extremely friendly and polished in their service. The level of attention to detail and service was exactly what you would expect from a premium/luxury hotel and we were blown away by the level of service we received during our entire stay. For example, the breakfast buffet hostess/manager knew the date of our checkout even though we had never brought it up and wished us safe travels and a good trip. This was an impressive level of detail and internal coordination by the hotel staff. Props to Ivan, the director of operations who we ran into at check-out, for his excellent stewardship of this property and its level of service.

2) The rooms are well-furnished, built using premium materials, and felt luxurious. The bedrooms were decorated with hardwood and the entire bathroom was made of stone, materials you rarely see in a standard hotel. I am also extremely sensitive to noise, but the rooms had great noise insulation. We were only a few floors below the night club and you could hear the club music and vibrations in the elevator lobby, but once you got to your room, the noise completely disappeared. The room was also of a large size and very comparable to the larger American sized rooms we are normally accustomed too. After two weeks of smaller hotel rooms, this Hyatt's bigger sized rooms were a real treat. Mattress was comfortable and the room was extremely clean on arrival. We also appreciated the daily housekeeping service we received.

3) The breakfast buffet.  As seems to be a consistent theme for this hotel, the service and buffet offerings were of a premium quality. The spread and variety were enormous, with both standard European breakfast options and also hot options more similar to what you'd see at an English or American breakfast. Offerings were also of a high-quality, such as their yogurt bar with various nutritional powders (i.e., morinaga, omega 3, acai, etc.). We also want to publicly recognize our server Fernando and the hostess at the reception of the breakfast buffet who also appeared to be the manager (didn't get her name unfortunately). Both provided phenomenal friendly, polished service and attention to detail on both days that we visited the buffet. 

4) The hotel and its surrounding area felt safe. Floors in the hotel can only be accessed if you are residing on that floor. So for example, we had floor 22 and my sister had floor 10. As I wasn't staying on floor 10 though, I couldn't actually access her floor without her accompanying me with her key card. Loved this security feature as there are a lot of non-hotel guests coming and going in the hotel for the night club and other events. We also frequently came back to the hotel from the metro late at night around 23:00 or 0:00 after a full day of exploring the city center, and we felt completely safe walking from the metro to the hotel. 

Areas for Improvement:
1) Check-in took a long time, probably about 30-40 minutes for us. It seemed like there were tech issues and the agent serving us may have been a bit newer and was having difficulty checking us into both rooms, having to ask colleagues for assistance several times. At the same time, several guests who arrived at the same time or after us were being checked in much quicker by other agents. This was a really minor blip for us though, and we don't fault the agent or the hotel, as this is an issue that can easily be resolved with more training and opportunity to practice for the agent. Furthermore, the agent was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and proactive when we also asked for recommendations on places for tapas in the city.

2) The location of the hotel is close to the airport, but a bit far from the center of Barcelona. This isn't really something that the hotel can change, but I'd just note it for potential guests. It does take a while to get into the city center (probably 20-40 minutes depending on where you're trying to go), but the hotel is conveniently located on Line 1 of the metro (about a 5-10 minute walk) and there are bus stops next to the hotel that take you directly to the airport. Transportation options are convenient and readily available. The area around the hotel felt safe and quiet as well, so that was another plus even if it's further out. I don't think the distance would deter us from booking here again in the future, but something to note.

Overall, we had an amazing experience at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower. The consistent friendly polished service from the staff and large premium rooms are the big draws for us, and we will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2024,06,02
30,Fun time for the family!,So much fun! I took my wife and our two kids- 8 and 10 years old. They had a blast. I have never done anything like this before and I really liked ho Le it kept the kids involved throughout the whole dinner. Ver cool idea and me and my family really enjoyed dinner.,5,2024,06,01
30,"Clean, comfortable, beautiful view, unexpected hold of 50 euros per night","The view was lovely, the rooms were clean and some staff were very helpful, especially the male staff on the ground floor. However my experience was tainted by  the hold of 50 euros per night. Please put this in your ad so clients will be aware. This is an unexpected cost for those on a budget, even if you may get it back",3,2024,05,31
30,5/5 stars!,"This hotel exceeded all expectations. We were warmly welcomed by Catalina, who made sure we had everything we needed and gave us really helpful advice on transportation. Jose brought up cava & chocolate covered strawberries which absolutely made our day and put smiles on our faces. We will absolutely be returning to this Hyatt regency in the future.",5,2024,05,31
30,"Really nice experience, Barcelona it‚Äôs charming city already, and this hotel has its perfect hospitality service.","Love this hotel, everything is just perfect, breakfast was really nice!  David from front office is just the perfect staff, willing to help all the time, warm greetings, and true hospitality is fully represent by him. Location was okay but still not very far from where I would love to go. Would come back next time.",5,2024,05,29
30,Perfect stay for short vacation in Barcelona,"The hotel is quite clean and staff is quite friendly. Only issue is that the hotel is a little away from the city center (~30 minutes metro), but the traffic is convient and the metro station is quite close.",5,2024,05,29
30,Wonderful experience at a spacious hotel,"Great experience. We arrived here with our 2 small kids and the hotel staff were very accommodating from day 1. I would especially like to thank Jose from room service in practical.  He exceeded our expectations in anything in particular, and made our stay very enjoyable.",5,2024,05,28
30,"People were wonderful, bed was terrible","We decide to upgrade to a higher class of room. The room was amazingly beautiful and all was great until we went to bed. I don‚Äôt think I can express just how terrible the bed was. I know it was a mattress, but as god is my witness it was really just a thin topper on a box spring. It was the hardest bed I have ever tried to sleep on. After 10 minutes of trying to sleep on my side my shoulder would start hurting. Being already past midnight,I was not going to call and have someone either try to make the bed more comfortable at that time or have us switch rooms at that time. I talked to someone the next morning, explained the issue to them, but also that we could not stay there at that time to deal with this as we had a tour planed. I was told to go ahead with our plans and all would be set right when we returned. Upon our return, the desk clerk was unaware that we had reported an issue with the room. At this point Maria became involved. Maria was absolutely wonderful. She immediately took charge of the issue. She told us that, as we speak, a thicker topper was being added to our bed. She also set us up at the bar with a complimentary drink while we waited for the issue to be addressed. She let us know when the work was finished, but also asked us to contact her immediately if we felt the bed was still an issue. Later she had a fruit selection sent to our room along with a note apologizing for the inconvenience. It is because of employees like Maria that we will stay at a Hyatt in the future. The extra thick topper made the bed much better and allowed us to sleep comfortably. To sum it up - wonderful room, absolutely terrible bed, absolutely wonderful staff. Hire more like Maria!",4,2024,05,28
30,Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower,"Friendly and helpful staff at reception and in the bar, Angel and Nacho are great. Had a meal in the restaurant, Ali made us feel really welcome and made this quite special. All in all I would highly recommend the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower for any stay.",5,2024,05,27
30,"Was very average and not located well, out of city center. Small rooms.","Nice but no frills. Will recommend a Spanish chain called ONLY YOU Hotels. Boutique + great service + excellent properties. Also location not so good. Far from city center. Rooms small/tight. Food very average. For the price we paid in non season, could have got a better place. Suggest do not use third party sites for booking. Direct hotel sites are cheaper.",3,2024,05,27
30,Great experience with a great staff.,The staff was very friendly and helpful. Everyone had a smile on their face from check-in to check-out. Thanks for the great stay !!,5,2024,05,27
30,GREAT FOOD AND ARCHITECTURE EXPERIENCE,"to all,  I had the pleasure to enjoy the brunch menu at this restaurant at the Terrum today 26 of May, restaurant in Regency Hyatt tower Barcelona!!!! I highly recommend to everyone who likes food, services and wines, plus amazing architectural place. We hadand introduction by Enric and he is amazing host.",5,2024,05,26
30,Horrible Guest Service,"Let's start with our first impression of this hotel. When we arrived we were greeted by a guy a with a thick British accent called O-Mathew. From the very beginning he had an odd attitude. He was not welcoming at all and it felt like he is doing us a favour rather than doing his job. I asked for a crib for our baby and he completely ignored my request, as if I am talking to the wall. He did not even bother helping us with our luggage. We took a cart and he told us, the guest to bring back the cart to the lobby!!!

Once we got in our room I called the concierge again and asked for a crib, which finally arrived.

The next day I called to ask for an extra bedsheet, because there was a huge stain from the previous guests, which I only noticed the day after our arrival. Again, instead of providing us the bedsheet, Mr. Mathew told me that they will change the bedsheets when they clean our room. Instead of ruining my day and arguing that I need the bedsheet now rather than later, I decided to leave this review for the manager to see what kind of service the guests are receiving by this incompetent person.

Also, there is no pool in this hotel! The pool is falsely advertised as a part of this hotel. There is an adults only gym with a pool located in a separate building, which happens to be in close proximity to this hotel.  You have to pay to use it. So, I don't understand why there is a picture of a pool in this hotel's website.

On the plus side, this hotel is located close to the airport and has a beautiful and impressive breakfast, which is by the way not cheap at all. The club on the rooftop is also very beautiful and loud.",3,2024,05,25
30,Impeccable service and quality!,"Service here is impeccable! On our first night, we decided to have an early dinner at Axis bar and terrace since this was the only place open at 5pm. We ordered the burgers for the kids, the lobster roll for myself and the corvina for my husband and everyone loved their meal! Ali tended to us and he was very friendly and accommodating!",5,2024,05,24
30,5 Star Hotel - Great for Business and Families,"A very nice hotel, short trip from the airport. Very easy to get to and the check in process was a breeze. The room was ready before my checkin time but they let me checkin early at no extra charge! The staff is very friendly and accommodating and the Hyatt Lounge is well stocked. Skyfall rooftop nightclub is a blast - be sure to checkout! 

The metro stop into downtown  Barcelona is a short 3 minute walk away from the hotel - just take the redline straight into central Barcelona - 20 minute metro ride. 

The pool is very clean - nice to have a dip after a long day. 

The dining on premise is very good - and perhaps come of the best carbonara I have had while visiting Barcelona. I definitely will be back. 

Thanks to the team - Caroline, Maria , Ivan",5,2024,05,22
30,Beautiful hotel and welcoming staff,"My recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower was wonderful. The hotel is beautiful, staff are welcoming and the room was excellent. Highly recommend",5,2024,05,22
30,Poor management customer service and housekeeping,"Shockingly bed  sheets were not changed from previous occupant and several body hairs were found by the hotel evening housekeeper . 

Stains of some sort ( body fliud?) beside the bed on the sideboard  .

Complained to the management not even an acknowledgment so failiure to lead or ensure staff not overworked ( saw cleaning staff working till 5pm) and failiure to attend to detail, kettle but no cups  ,room not cleaned till 4:30pm  upon request.
Swimming pool closed . So not sure why this is 5 star : beware of using the metro after dark , poorly lit from the station  and rough sleepers.
Redeeming feature good breakfast and  nice kitchen staff -one section that did function properly  go out of the way to be helpful but no latte. Decent size room, showers and airconditioning good: no local shops or food places so you have to travel in to the centre and that is 45min each way.",2,2024,05,19
30,Wonderful service and a great staff.,"After an unfortunate incident with our luggage the hotel went out of thier way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Many thanks to Maria and Ivan and the team. Well done!!  We can certainly recommend  this hotel, and when we return to Barcelona we'll be back!",5,2024,05,19
30,Professional service and great experience,"Hotel is very nice clean and easy access to airport. I would like to mention Antonio who was great help and very professional. Great experience all in all. Reception was also very kind and helpful. room is clean and modern, really nice shower üòä",5,2024,05,18
30,Guest  Experience,We were in Europe for 25 days traveling around. Barcelona was our favorite place especially the Hyatt Regency Barcelona. Upon arrival at check in Hannan at the front desk took care of us and set us up. Regency club had great food and drinks as Maria there was also awesome. Ivan the Director of Operations helped us at breakfast and made sure our stay was memorable. Matthew at the front desk and another gentleman greeting guest at the lobby were also attentive and friendly. For a Hyatt Regency the level of service is like a Forbes five star property. I am already planning to come back.,5,2024,05,14
30,Amazing,We were treated absolutely amazing by everyone from the front desk to the executive director Ivan.    They all made our first trip to Europe so special and welcoming for us.  We would definitely come back here again.   Very warm and wonderful staff,5,2024,05,11
30,Clean hotel but not practical,"I booked this hotel about 8 months before visiting and paid when booking. We visited for a special occasion and booked a king room with a panoramic view. Our hotel room wasn‚Äôt that high and had the view facing the motorway rather than Barcelona. Given we booked well in advance I had hoped for better. The room was big and clean, however there are far too many mirrors in the bathroom to imply the room is bigger than it is, and instead feels like a fun house at a carnival. The location is remote so requires getting taxis everywhere which were relatively frequent. There was also night lights in the bedroom and bathroom which we couldn‚Äôt turn off which wasn‚Äôt ideal for sleeping. TV and bed were huge and the bed was comfy. We also checked in and out online, but then still had to check in and out at reception so that felt like a waste of time.",3,2024,05,11
30,Impressive hotel experience,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of April 2024. The hotel front desk staff were so helpful with regard to answering our questions about transportation to and front the various areas of Barcelona that we wanted to visit. It was our first visit to this area and were grateful for the help. The location is about a 20 min cab ride to the city center area, but the additional room space and comfort that we experience was so worth the drive.
Additionally, the buffet breakfast was oustanding. We would stay here again. ",5,2024,05,11
30,As expected for this kind of hotel,"Nothing to mention, except that some lamps around the bed to allow reading would have been appreciated",5,2024,05,10
30,Excellent hotel.,Great hotel for business and also when needing to be near the airport. Fantastic restaurant for food and service. The quality of the food is as good as many of the restaurants in the city center and also has a good wine list for both bottles and by the glass.,5,2024,05,03
30,Memorable Birthday for my husband,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower.  The lovely receptionist Maite - noticed from my husband's passport that it was birthday. She generously sent some cake to our room.

When it couldn't get any better - it did. We walked into our room and found the amazing guest services manager - Roger Arroyo - had arranged to have cake and champagne delivered to the room. It was wonderful! We had a beautiful room with a great view. It was a fantastic experience for my husband's birthday and our first night in Barcelona. 

The breakfast buffet was fantastic. Would highly recommend this hotel.

Thank you Maite and Roger for making my husband's birthday so memorable.",5,2024,05,02
30,Not excellent restaurant was terro,"Location is far from restaurants and saguaro familia that ‚Äúmarket‚Äù in the lobby was a joke
No fruit or vegetables ",4,2024,04,29
30,Exceptional stay at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower!,"This is a beautiful and very unique hotel.  Perfect if you are flying out of BCN.  Team members were extremely professional and friendly.  Checking in was smooth, my compliments to Matthew who assisted me.  the breakfast was really a wonderful experience, the setup and the food quality was top notch.  If I ever go back to Barcelona I will stay here again.",5,2024,04,27
30,Reliable hotel,"I love staying in this hotel.  It may not be very near the city center but the metro station is near.  It is also in a quiet neighborhood, across the University of Barcelona.",5,2024,04,27
30,"Very nice business hotel, with great comfort.","The hotel has a spectecular lobby and spacious rooms with even greater bathrooms. Staff attention is exemplary! The Club Sandwich in the Axis Bar is the best I ever had. The hotel is between the airport and the city center m, which can be easily reached via the nearby subway. Just the lift controls are super confusing.
This is not a romantic hideaway, but a well run business hotel of high standards. No romantic setting but seaview from the higher floors, accross the freight harbour and the airport.",5,2024,04,23
30,recent one night stay Hyatt Regency Barcelona,"Very clean, modern hotel with excellent staff, close to the airport we stayed in prior to flying out of Barcelona. Highly recommend.",5,2024,04,21
30,Just wonderful.,Beautiful hotel. Restaurant staff very courteous. Front desk is outstanding. Very friendly & helpful. Breakfast included was amazing. Had a lot of choices. Terrum the restaurant has beautiful decor & fine dining. Ali the food and beverage manager went out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of. All in all a positive experience.,5,2024,04,12
30,Hyatt Regency Barcelona,"Hyatt Regency is a luxurious situated at a quieted nice environment.
It is a 29 floors tour that allows you to have a panoramic view of the city.
The lobby is originally decorated with a very large screen for tv lovers.
You can also enjoy live music from time to time with various guest artists.
The staff is very warm and welcoming.",5,2024,04,11
30,Awesome place in Barcelona,"I have stayed here for 5 days and the experience is beyond awesome. 

The front door and reception area catch my eyes first. They are a magnificent introduction to the hotel's commitment to beauty and comfort, making a strong first impression. The staffs are also very nice and warm. 

The room is spacious and clean, which I appreciated a lot. Moreover, I stayed in one of the city view room on the high floors. From the room I can directly see many attractions in Barcelona, such as La Sagrada Familia, Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and Olympic Ring. I am also able to watch the sunrise from Mediterranean Sea on my bed, which is a very unique experience for me. 

The breakfast is amazing. The croissants and honeydew melon are the best I have had. And the club lounge offers real and great tapas in the evening. The lounge also have a great collection of beverages and alcoholic ones. 

As to the location, I had no trouble during my stay to find the bus or metro to the city center of Barcelona. The hotel is very close to bus station and metro station. 

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to tourists .",5,2024,04,08
30,Making memories,"Such a memorable birthday getaway for my mum. All the staff were very friendly and attentive. The breakfast buffet was the best we experienced, so many choices. Great location, close to the metro. The room was comfortable and clean. Great stay. Thank you Hyatt!",5,2024,04,06
30,Awesome Place & Service,"Check in was smooth. Marina was helpful. She even called to follow up if the room is good.

We had excellent service at Axis. Angel was awesome and the food was delicious! 

We would come back again here and recommend Hyatt Regency to our friends and families. 

Noemi & Tim",5,2024,04,03
30,A very good choice,"We have been here many times.  The hotel tower itself is very impressive and luxurious.  It rises above all its surroundings.  The rooms are larger than expected and very well designed.  The view from the room is extraordinary.  The staff are professional, friendly, welcoming and helpful.  Breakfast is very good with high standards.  The restaurant ""le petite chef"" is a unique experience, highly recommended even if one is not a guest of the hotel.  The show, entertainment and animation are fantastic, the food is top quality and the service is absolutely top.  It should definitely receive a Michelin rating.  The Regency Club is fantastic and better than other hotels.  The rooms are well clean, well equipped and maintained.  The only bad thing is that surely eventually the check out time will come.  The location is very good.  On the one hand, it is not in the center of the city, so the surroundings are not too crowded and have everything one needs: supermarket, barbershop, bakery, market, pharmacy, restaurants and so on.  On the other hand, there is very comfortable and economical public transport to the city center and anywhere else. Bottom line: a very good choice.",5,2024,04,02
30,Lovely Hotel,Lovely and helpful staff. It was near the airport and also there was metro near the hotel so it's not hard to go around. My room was clean and cozy. Breakfast was great. Didn't had the chance to explore more of the hotel. But will definitely be back.,5,2024,03,30
30,Excellent Location,"Very nice clean and quiet hotel. Around 10 minutes from the airport and a walking distance from a big shopping mall.

Staff are very friendly.

There is however need to ensure that the ""market"" operates 24 hrs as mentioned.

30,Hyatt regency barcelona tower,Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower is one of the most stylish modern business hotels in Barcelona. It has a massive LED screen in the lobby for interior design and to show major sports events. There is huge banquet functions space down stairs for big events.,4,2024,03,27
30,Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower,"We had a wonderful stay at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower. The hotel may not be in the middle of town (closer to the airport) . Access to the city was a 10 minute walk to the metro station across the hospital parking lot and a 15-20 minute metro ride to center of town.  The hotel was very clean and nice. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The club lounge on the 5 floor always had a great tapas selection every evening.
  
   I'd like to give a special thank you to Maria, our hostess during the week in the Club Lounge. She was very attentive, informative, and courteous to our needs. It was always a pleasure to hear a warm and friendly ""Welcome"", from her, at the end of the day, as soon as we entered the Club Lounge.

   After having a medical emergency at the club lounge, I was so thankful for the assistance of all the staff, they were very attentive, courteous, and helpful. Even days after the incident the staff was so kind to inquire about my wellbeing. It makes me proud to be a Hyatt loyalist. Every day coming back to the hotel was like coming home. 

Overall, I'd like to thank all the staff at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower for a wonderful stay and look forward to my next stay there when in Barcelona.

30,Beautiful hotel,"It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel. The lobby is a nice place to relax.  They have a large wall to wall screen for entertainment watching whiling enjoying a beverage or something to eat.  The bed is comfortable, with bathrobes and slippers, amble space, don‚Äôt miss the Sky Fall tower highly recommended ",5,2024,03,22
30,Good location and great hotel,"The hotel is only about 10 minutes away Barcelona from stadium, and other attractions. It's in a very good condition. We had a family suite which has two rooms connected, very rare in the city. The rooms are great, comfortable. ",5,2024,03,18
30,"Excellent staff, Nice hotel","I was at this hotel last week, and have to say the experience was excellent. 

I checked in late, and the overnight staff were excellent. Polite, helpful and just genuinely nice people. I forgot toothpaste, they helped me out. We were talking and I said I was travelling for work over my birthday, they organised a surprise for me. 

The room was lovely, the restaurant was excellent, but honestly, it was the staff that made it for me. 

Highly recommended.",5,2024,03,12
30,Incompetent staff at front desk,"The check in was slow and so was the check out. Staff promised to send invoice with company name on - it never happened and approached in person, by phone and email it still didn‚Äôt happen. Very annoying ",2,2024,03,09
30,Very good stay in Barcelona,"All I can say my stayed was amazing I was able to relax beautiful room 5 out of 5 , Hyatt never disappoint me and this stayed was amazing , location is good if you are leaving Barcelona soon since it‚Äôs close to the airport and close to the city too ",5,2024,03,02
30,Barcelona with family,"Amazing Hotel. Ivan made our stay unbeatable. The view from our room was incredible. You couldn't ask for more, a luxury hotel. 5 star service, fantastic breakfasts, you couldn't ask for more. Without a doubt if I return to Barcelona I would stay at this hotel again.",5,2024,02,26
30,Hyatt Regency Stay for a conference,"The 3 nights' stay was great and comfortable. All staff were very efficient and helpful at all times. The food quality for breakfast and dinner was excellent. I would recommend this hotel for either a business or a personal holiday stay. 
",5,2024,02,12
30,Excellent Choice You Won't Regret!,"Very nice, clean and modern hotel as one would expect from a Hyatt owned property.  Our room was spacious with our King bed.  Want to thank Mr. Roger Arroyo (Guest Relations) for his outstanding hospitality to ensure a memorable experience for my wife's birthday.  We immensely appreciated his genuine time and effort to make our stay very special, which exceeded our expectations.  We absolutely enjoyed our stay and would consider staying there again on some future visit.",5,2024,02,01
30,Great facility especially when you are a World of Hyatt member,"They really know how to treat a loyal customer ... great upgrade, warm greetings and helpful ...

I rate them 9 ... 10 if they could have more food alternatives ... I had 2 - 3 good meals there ... but I still need to go out for more alternatives since I can not eat the same food every meals :)",5,2024,01,30
30,Avoid this venue. No Security. Poor customer service.,"AVOID. My bicycle was stolen from my car parked at this Hyatt Regency Tower in Barcelona in Dec 2023. The security team did not detect the incident until I alerted them at my return, and it seems there are no security cameras in place, despite the clear website information that reads ""Sleep soundly knowing your vehicle is parked and taken care of in our secure garage"".  

The response from the management was extremely disappointing, even after acknowledging the theft and involving the police. I received no compensation, no replacement for the stolen item, and not even a reimbursement for the parking expenses. The reply by the hotel manager was ""very sorry this happened, the insurance says they do not cover the garage area"". Weak effort, to say the least. 

This experience was highly unexpected, especially considering it happened at a Hyatt property, particularly the fact that the hotel itself is unwilling to bare the costs.",1,2024,01,26
30,Best Barcelona Hotel,"My only disappointment was staying here just one night.

A beautiful, upgraded room, a great lounge area, nice Regency Club, close to airport, and an easy metro ride to the hear of Barcelona.  If I could do our trip over, we would have stayed here the entire time!
",5,2024,01,11
30,Nice Airport Area Hotel,"We enjoyed this hotel for a night before catching an early flight. 

Room size, mattress, water pressure, and HVAC all good. Expansive views of the area. Friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful, grand lobby with bar and food. 

The sky lounge was disappointing - old stained carpet, old furniture, and bad design. It needs a complete remodel, and we hope that will happen soon. 

The location appears to be in the middle of nowhere, but a 365 sandwich shop, a restaurant, a pharmacy, and two convenience stores are a six minute walk from the hotel. One of the stores carries distilled water. 

A nice experience overall. The bars and restaurants are pricey, but this is an American hotel after all, with American, not Spanish, prices.",5,2024,01,10
30,No Pool for kids ,"A lovely entrance and lobby, friendly welcome and nice staff at breakfast. Beautiful hotel just a bit far from the city, metro is closeby.  A note for those with children, when booking it states swimming pool as available but it‚Äôs not for children. The breakfast was not the greatest, we cancelled it after a day, stale bread and there is a convenient cafe close by. Not enough staff during the busy new years at the reception or bar. I thought this was a 4 star hotel but it is 5 star, you get slippers/robes and tea in room but no water is supplied. There‚Äôs local shops which sell it at a fraction of the price. They don‚Äôt arrange taxis either so there was a scrabble to get a taxi we pre booked, which was not ideal. Overall a pleasant stay, with quite clean rooms. A plus note there is a park closeby if you have to stay with little ones ",4,2024,01,02
30,Lack of basic amenity and staff responsiveness,We booked a king room with club room access as a World of Hyatt member but the wifi in our room did not work (error message says router needs to be reset) and the shower did not even have hot water. We contacted the front desk staff around 11:30pm. They said someone will come take a look. We waited till midnight and called again. The staff who picked up the phone said there had been a shift change so he was not aware of the issue. He said he can come take a look once he checked in some guests. We waited till 12:30pm and had to come down to the front desk to request a room change. This is far from the amenities and service we expected from Hyatt. ,1,2024,01,01
30,"Away from the city, modern, clean, upscale","This property was an Uber ride away from the downtown Barcelona. it's closer to the airport and provided plenty of space. Very hip, modern rooms, stylist bathrooms, AMAZING breakfast options, sleek rooftop bar. Took grownup kids with us and they loved the room, the view, and the breakfast presentation and taste. We could spend the day doing touristy activities and took an uber/taxi over to spend a relaxing time back at the hotel.",5,2023,12,31
30,Don‚Äôt overlook this location ,"My sister and I stayed for 3 nights in October during quick trip to Barcelona. This location works- close to Airport and right at a Metro station for going into the city for sightseeing (we are very comfortable with public transport and theirs is efficient).  Excellent point redemption. As a globalist, I  provided small room upgrade to city view which has views of all the sights.  Nice, clean room and property. We also had access to a really expansive and delicious breakfast buffet (or club) and club in the evenings for tapas and drinks. ",5,2023,12,30
30,Honestly I expected it to be much better that it was.,"Our bedroom wasn't as clean as it should have been.
The breakfast was a bit disappointing, as I read some time ago that was one of the best buffet in Barcelona, and the level wasn't up to my expectations. Been in inferior category hotels where the breakfast was much better.
Check in, and waiters were very nice, kind, and helpful, but out of that the experience wasn't at all as I expected. Quite sad, really.",3,2023,12,29
30,Great solo traveller experience,"Excellent service and lovely hotel, all staff were friendly and helpful. 

Room was very clean too.

Sadly only stayed one night. The bar man on the ground floor made a lovely carrot juice cocktail - worth a try if that‚Äôs your thing! Picture attached",5,2023,12,12
30,Poor service,"While the location is close to the airport, it is far from the city center where all of the tourist sites are.  We chose it for the club level and larger rooms.  The views were nice. The club level provide breakfast and tapas and drinks daily. 

The service was less than spectacular.  We had an issue with the smell in our initial room and we were able to change rooms thanks to help of Paloma.  They did upgrade one of the rooms for our inconvenience. But the smell continued upstairs- not sure what the problem is with the drainage at the hotel.

Also the fire alarm went off two night while were sleeping which made the next day quite tiring as a tourist.  In addition, above us was the penthouse suite and another night, they play loud, thumping music keeping us up until 4 am!  Talk about not getting restful sleep.  I advised the staff but no one did anything at that hour of the night.  
We additionally had the temperature in the shower stop working which could not be fixed and thy did give us a concession since we did not want to move rooms again! 

The heat in our living area was not working which no one came to address at all. 

The front desk also messed up my reservation for my hyatt points at check out and just felt that was not their problem.  They clearly did not care and felt it was someone else's problem.  Instead I have to be on the phone for endless hours with corporate.

The staff needs better training in customer service if they expect us to stay loyal to the Hyatt brand.  

I would not stay here again. ",1,2023,12,12
30,Great staff and great service,We stayed 5 nights at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower.  The location is between the city and the airport and very convienent to public transportation.  The staff was amazing!! They antisipated what we might need and were always there to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  I would recommend this hotel and the staff as an A++.,5,2023,12,10
30,Restaurant / checkin /out services,"Checkin / out long queues of people. Not enough positions nor staff
Restaurants not open most of time.
Restaurant menu extremely limited

30,Incredible hotel with great facilities!,"An amazing hotel with incredible facilities! The staff were friendly and helpful! The breakfast area included a wide variety of food, all of which were very tasty! The room was spacious with window-walls offering a breathtaking view of the city! The hotel also offered a wide variety of amenities in the room. The food of the Terrum restaurant was delicious, a truly unique experience! The cocktails of the Skyfall bar were also well prepared, unique and delicious! ",5,2023,11,17
30,Totally recommend staying at Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower!,"I stayed at Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower during November 2023 and I would totally choose it again during my next trip to Barcelona. Its biggest highlight is its unbeatable location, only a 10-minute drive from the airport which is extremely useful, but also only a 4-minute walk from the red metro line L1 which takes you directly to all major attractions such as Placa de Catalunya, Barcelona Cathedral or Arc de Triomf. Overall, the hotel was amazing with modern infrastructures and our room on the 21st floor was simply mind-blowing. The views were breathtaking and the room was huge, with a large living room overlooking the city and a bedroom also overlooking the city, two separate toilets and one large main bathroom area with a walk-in wardrobe, bathtub and shower. The amenities provided were the best I've ever had in any hotel in my life, including even women hygiene products, comb, mouth wash and shoe polish! The breakfast was delicious with a large variety and pancakes being made on the spot by a machine. We tried the Terrum restaurant for one dinner and I cannot recommend it enough. The dishes were so delicious that we couldn't stop eating! Also Skyfall bar is totally worth a visit, as the cocktails are really tasty and the city views from the igloo-like glass are terrific. Finally I cannot miss to mention the staff who were all really helpful and kind and took amazing care of us. Totally recommend staying there!",5,2023,11,17
30,A modern and nice experience.,Large room and nice view. Excellent staff and service. Very good breakfast and excellent service delivered with a smile. I did not have time to visit the spa or the nightclub but looking forward to do so next time!,5,2023,11,10
30,Amazing customer service,"The hotel is great, from rooms to Regency Club to an amazing staff. But one person made a difference as she went above and beyond to accommodate my needs. Her name is Iman (maybe they‚Äôre an ‚Äúe‚Äù at the end of her name), she was incredible. Thank you Iman for your amazing customer service, you really took my experience to the next level.",5,2023,10,29
30,Exceptional in every way,"The hotel is state of the art and the staff goes above and beyond in every way to accommodate each guest with the most helpful and friendly attitude, Even offering suggestions in some instances for something a guest may have been unaware of

",5,2023,10,28
30,Very welcoming and stylish,"Very nice hotel!
Very accommodating staff, with special thanks to Maite!
Although travelling for work, the experience gave a bit of holiday feeling.
Received an unexpected upgrade to a gorgeous room on floor 25. View was amazing!",5,2023,10,24
30,Barcelona Hotel after Cruising,"The hotel is far from where the action is in Barcelona (La Rambla) but gives a feeling of calm and peace after the cruise. The Uber costs about 20 Euros to go to the city. 
We did not have any luck in the restaurants the hotel offers as the Terrum serves dinner at 7:30 PM. Sky Club does not seem to have a whole lot to offer as far as food in concerned. When we got there, the host only gave us 1 menu for the food and 1 for the drinks and there were 4 of us. So we settled for the Axis Lounge and Lobby Bar but I did not find a great selection. The food tasted good and the presentation. Like I said in my previous comment, I was told that tap water is not potable.",4,2023,10,23
30,Great Hotel,Stayed here on last night of Barcelona / Catalonia trip due to proximity to the airport. I bounced around Catalonia and Barcelona hotels during my stay and this was by far the best one. Very nice accommodations. Very clean and had everything o needed in the room. ,5,2023,10,23
30,Standard have slipped,"Terrible food and mould in my shower. Super noisey AC, moved to a larger room also a dirty shower the quality of this establishment has fallen significantly since my last visit. It‚Äôs a real shame as the staff are typically very engaging. I‚Äôd advise not booking on a Thursday as when trying to reach your room, you are fighting to get an elevator to your room with people who are partying at the skyfall bar on the roof.  It took me an age to reach my room, every time the door would shut in the elevator, another 5 people would squeeze into the elevator. Horrible ",2,2023,10,21
30,Piotr,"Excellent service, very nice and helpful people, quick reaction, very good food. Beautyfull restauarant on TOP of the hotel with Barcelona view, really excating in the late evening. Recomend this hotel which is close to the AirPort.",5,2023,10,18
30,Loved this hotel!,"My flight was cancelled and booked this as it was not too far from the airport but looked lovely - easy to book on the great Hyatt app.

Hotel was lovely - wonderful dinner at the lovely restaurant and had the unexpected surprise of watching a Springsteen concert on the multi-story screen in the lobby visible through the large bank of windows in the restaurant.  Went up to the super cool glass dome on the 29th floor for drinks and great music and a super 260 view of Barcelona.  The breakfast was fantastic - so many options and the staff was lovely.  Great service throughout the hotel.  ",5,2023,10,15
30,Nice hotel stay before terrible MSC Seaview cruise,"We stayed at this hotel for the 2 days prior to our 7 day cruise on the MSC Seaview. Cab fare from airport was 26 euros. Our room was small, but great 19th floor view overlooking University of Barcelona. Very modern and clean. The pool and gym were nice, although we think the kid using the pool had a fecal accident, so we evacuated immediately. There‚Äôs an area within walking distance that has shops and even a McDonalds that seemed sketchy in the afternoon, but came to life in the evening and morning. The taxi fare to the port was 26 euros. Taxi fare to Las Ramblas was 30 euros round trip. There is a metro station across the street and bus nearby. We ate breakfast at the restaurant. A buffet with bloody mary bar 26 euros per person. We would definitely use this hotel again.",4,2023,10,13
30,Good business hotel,"Five nights here with lounge access were stayed.  Its a large hotel, good amenities.  The room was large and comfortable.  The hotel is not in the city center, its about 30-40 minutes by subway to the historic center or you can take the bus.  The hotel is adjacent to highways and visible to the airport.  
The lounge (if you have access) is comfortable.  Drinks available all day, the food offerings were a little disappointing, not more than a few tapas items and often they were dry or over cooked.  Breakfast is better in the restaurant.  
The hotel has a small fitness center, smaller than you would expect for a hotel this size.  I used the adjacent metropolitan gym which the hotel had an arrangement for but was an extra cost.  It had everything you would need, full gym, pool, lockers, towels, sauna, etc.  ",4,2023,10,09
30,Pre cruise Stay,"My family stayed here for one night before our cruise. It‚Äôs a quick and inexpensive Taxi ride to the port and to the city. The staff was amazing and helpful. We found the beds to be very firm and the bathroom lighting a little dark for our taste, but overall the hotel is beautiful and clean and we recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona wanting to stay outside of the city. ",5,2023,10,04
30,Great Accommodations but Even Better Staff. Ask for Roger!,"We were traveling with a large group in Barcelona so we decided to stay at the Hyatt which is a little bit away from town but could better accommodate a large group. Most of the main attractions in town are only a short taxi ride away so it made getting places fairly easy. There is also a subway station across the street that is very accessible. 

Overall the Hyatt was comfortable and had great amenity‚Äôs.

But the shining star of this review was Roger one of the Guest Service staff. He was by far the greatest tool for me as I was a bit in over my head trying to lead a group of 21 people through the city. 

He and I traded WhatsApp and immediately he got to work helping me book restaurants, buy FC Barcelona Tickets, and everything in between. I could not have pulled off the trip without his help. 

Hopefully Roger and his management reads this review because the man deserves a promotion for all his hard work and dedication. Even messaging me on his days off to help my group. Truly a rockstar. Thank you Roger and I look forward to seeing you again.",5,2023,10,02
30,Fantastic hotel with panoramic views.,"Big rooms, very clean. All modern facilities with an adequate pool. Nice bar on top of the hotel with amazing views. Gym. Pricey food and drink but the staff compensate for this with good customer service throughout.",5,2023,10,02
30,Wonderful One Night Stay Convenient to Airport,"A great stay for one night. We wanted a hotel close to the airport as we had a very early flight out with young children. The rooms were spacious, the food on site was very good, and the staff was very helpful. They helped us arrange a large early morning taxi and made sure we had everything we needed for the kids. Our 3 year old especially loved the marshmallow bar in the lobby when we checked in. If you need a hotel outside the city center I would highly recommend this one.",5,2023,09,28
30,Good hotel but far from the center,"In general the hotel was good, the hotel is 20-30 minutes from the city center by metro.
the breakfast was good but there is no vegetable. the front receptions work slowly. they not clean dust at all, there is no free water. they do not  care from the safety of the guest outside of the hotel, i robbed in front of the hotel and Ms. PAULA CASTELL√Ä Duty Manager wrote to me that , since it was outside the hotel as shown by the security cameras, the hotel is not responsible for the incident. so be carefully,  ",3,2023,09,28
30,Great service,"This is mainly a conference venue as it is a long way from the city centre. However it is close to Metro line 1, and it has a lot to recommend it. The staff are excellent, food is really good and the rooms are spacious. The building was designed by Richard Rogers and completed in 2006 so it does have a rather industrial feel but that is not a drawback to guests.",5,2023,09,24
30,"Dated, industrial, clean, good hospitality, close to airport.","The rooms are adequate though designed in hard granite and glass. Beds are quite firm and the linens feel as if they are made from polyester, warm and not very breathable. Be careful not to slip in the shower.  However, they were clean and the front desk hospitality was excellent.  In general, the hotel feels dated, though the proximity to the Barcelona airport is a major plus.",3,2023,09,16
30,Very luxurious hotel.,"I am a Hyatt fan and this was an especially GREAT Hyatt experience in all ways!!  We slept so well and really appreciated the very nice bed, linens, and beautiful bathroom.  It was very quiet and clean.  The hotel amienities are super nice, including a wonderful European breakfast and very nice club lounge.  The only negative is that it is a bit far from downtown and the attractions.  But it was a great way for us to start and end our trip.  ",5,2023,09,14
30,Great Location/Great Service ,I would stay at this property time and time again. I stayed at a suite and came with Regency Club access and complimentary breakfast. Rooms were clean and spacious. Location is a quick 5 to 10 minute walk to the train. Friendly staff. ,5,2023,09,14
30,Better than expected!,"My partner and I booked this hotel at the last minute and it was WAY better than expected! Being from Las Vegas hospitality is a hard area to impress us in but this staff/hotel did just that! Easy to get all over the city, food was amazing, and the front desk was able to help us with every question we had. 10/10 recommend. We will be back. ",5,2023,09,13
30,"Super nice hotel, really recommend it!","Super nice hotel, we really enjoyed our stay! The staff were very friendly, gave us great recommendations, advices on public transportation and how to enjoy our stay. The hotel is one minute walking from a metro station where you can go to Plaza Catalunya (15min approx). The room was really great, and the have super nice lounge. Looking for a nice hotel with great service, then Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower is definitely to be considered. ",5,2023,09,10
30,Excellent Staff & Hotel,"From the moment we arrived at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Towers we felt at home! The young lady at the front desk Catalina was so welcoming, professional, and accommodating. We then visited the AXIS lounge and met Carlos an extraordinary bartender who was attentive, friendly, and made us some of the best cocktails we‚Äôve ever had! This is a great team and hotel and we wish we were here for a longer stay!",5,2023,09,04
30,Unexpected Find,"Due to unforeseen circumstances spent 4 nights.

Staff incredibly helpful, nothing was too much trouble.

Highly recommend, to others looking for quality accommodation.

15 min taxi ride to the centre, taxis right outside.

Breakfast choice and quality was second to none.

Rooms were excellent clean and bed and views of city were amazing from 16th floor but views from any floor would we good.",5,2023,09,02
30,Excellent option to stay in Barcelona,"Located in Barcelona peripheral but with metro station 2min walking. Fast access to downtown also by car. Very good accommodations, good quality sleep, great beds and pillows. Fast access to high floors due to four elevators. Quick access to parking garagem (direct from room floor). Very good breakfast for European standards. High recommended.",5,2023,08,27
30,Kind of a party hotel,"Do not book the suites unless you stay up late. I was super excited to book a loft suite but we could hear partying all hours of the night from the club on the top floor as well as people in the rooms adjoined to ours. They were partying and loud in their room and we could hear everything. Not their fault, they‚Äôre having a good time but these walls are so incredibly thin I couldn‚Äôt sleep well. Though it is a beautiful hotel I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be staying here again. ",3,2023,08,03
30,Profesional service and Great hotel,"There was really helpful team . Espcially, Adrian Serrano and Roger were very kind and profesional.They found solution quickly. I really thank them. The hotel close city center by metro. There was a metro station near the hotel. It was fantastic stay in this hotel. We stayed top floor and there was a perfect Barcelona view. We tried to lobby bar‚Äôs kokteyl, it was delicious. By the way, there were a lot of variety of breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,08,02
30,"Lovely hotel, but too far from where you want to be","I stayed here for five nights, entirely on points - with a suite upgrade award and of course Club access. The property is beautiful, inside anyway.  The pool is very depressing, but that is okay. There are beautiful nearby beaches! But what I didn‚Äôt like about this hotel is the location. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt mind the subway ride each way to get into the city.  The subways here are VERY EASY to understand, the best I‚Äôve ever seen in any country. But it takes about 40 minutes to get into the city. When I booked this, I thought the train would be fun. It‚Äôs fun but 40 min each way is so long! If you go out for the afternoon, come back to freshen up, then go out for the evening again, and finally take a subway home it is about 160 min of travel time. 2 hours and 40 minutes. It‚Äôs miserable. There are taxis aplenty but they get expensive, espc if you have already bought a 5-day bus pass. The Hyatt lounge is fantastic, with bottomless champagne and wine all day. The free breakfast is outstanding - a wonderful buffet, with champagne, Bloody Mary bar, screwdrivers, and options to order food from the kitchen. A lot of people miss this. You can get an omelette, eggs Benedict, avocado toast with poached egg, etc. It is fantastic. The restaurant upstairs is expensive and just ok. We loved loved loved Roger  in the lounge. What a kind man, who made us feel so welcome. We loved this property, it‚Äôs service & staff. My suite was huge with two bathrooms, a closet the size of a bedroom, a massive living room, bedroom, fancy rainfall shower and bath tub. My review is 5/5 because it‚Äôs all so nice. However, because it is so far away, we will stay somewhere else next time. I kept wishing I
Was at any other city hotel when I was there,
And was lamenting over the long commute. Also we did laundry nearby (you need cash but can get it from an ATM, even with a USA debit card). It was great. We stayed here for 5 days ri adjust jet lag and to see the city before a cruise.",5,2023,07,29
30,Stay in Barcelona,"We stayed in the Hyatt Regency at the start of our trip in Spain. We rented a car and drove to the hotel. The staff were great and helpful. We used our club access awards and used the Regency Club. They had scrambled eggs, ham, breads, fresh juice and coffee. The staff in the club were very professional and helpful. I want to highlight Roger in the Regency club who was very helpful and great to talk to. The rooms are large and quiet. The hotel is a little far from downtown but we drove into the city and found plenty of parking. There are lots of taxis available right outside the hotel so getting around is easy and a metro stop is a few blocks around. We enjoyed the views and our sons really enjoyed the snacks and drinks in the club. We traveled to the south and north of Spain and returned a day early to Barcelona so we could rest in the hotel. I highly recommend the hotel. ",5,2023,07,25
30,Inconvenient for tourists,Room was good but wasn‚Äôt happy about their cleaning and not providing drinking water at all . For the amount we paid it‚Äôs absolutely not acceptable not giving at least a bottle of water daily. Tap water tasted bad. We stayed for 4 nights. Also it‚Äôs far from the center and not advisable for tourists. There‚Äôs metro 5 minutes away but walking in the summer was quite tiring. Was very hot weather.,3,2023,07,16
30,Great stay at Hyatt Regency Barcelona,The hotel is excellent. Rooms are large enough for families with two children. Breakfast is very rich. Metro station is close and from there you can reach the whole city. The staff is also very responsive.,5,2023,07,16
30,Great Service,Every single person I came in contact with when above and beyond all expectations to make sure my stay was excellent.  The individual attention to what I needed and making sure I got what I needed was better than I expected and better than other high end hotels I have stayed at.,5,2023,07,05
30,Rude personnel not good location.,"Check in personnel rude, long line to check in, it took her 20 min to get our ""info"" into system, room not ready so we had to come back later... came back later, another 30 min line and. The. NO DATA in the system another 20 min, again the passports..  nobody apologetic... Location is really not convenient  if you are on vacations. ",3,2023,06,27
30,Hotel heaven,"I chose the hotel due to the location being close to where my job was for a few days. I was blown away by the size of the room, the facilities and the reception area with the biggest TV screen I have ever seen, playing concerts was incredible. Great stay and would go back in a heartbeat. ",5,2023,06,26
30,Could need some improvement,"The hotel looks very nice from the first view but rooms are not properly maintained (lights, mold in the shower). The food was far below expectations and certainly doesn't meet the price expectations especially in the Sky restaurant. Staff is very friendly, beds are good and cleaning was excellent.",3,2023,06,26
30,Great hotel to stay in Barcelona if you do not need to be close to the tourist spots,We rented a car from the airport and visited Montserrat and Andorra on different dates.  This hotel is ideal for such expiration as it is a 10 min drive from the airport and super easy to get on the major roads to go north without having to deal with down town traffic.  The rooms and dining are of great value compared with the average rates in the old town area,4,2023,06,22
30,Ok hotel but expensive,Check in requires a passport if out of country. Very expensive food and drink. The indoor pool was an upcharge of 12‚Ç¨ per day per person as the outdoor pool was closed.ll. The breakfast buffet was free and very good. Location was not the greatest and needed a taxi to go everywhere.,4,2023,06,20
30,Mini Trip,I enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower. I was there for a few days to see Beyonc√©. The staff was nice and helpful. The room was clean. Great amenities. The view from the Skyfall was amazing. The location is closer to the airport and just outside of the inner city but it‚Äôs near bus and train transit so there weren‚Äôt any issues getting around.,5,2023,06,16
30,Stay from Home,"I work hard, so like to play hard, so the hotel should be comfortable like being at home, I would stay again at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower. My only issue, we took the metro and could not find the hotel because the sign is not at the top of the hotel like most known brands.",5,2023,06,15
30,Pleasantly Surprised,"Booked four rooms last minute with the intent to be close to the airport and local attractions. Although the hotel is not in walking distance to local venues, cabs were readily available. All desired destinations were short drives from the hotel. The club level was a perfect area for our group to meet, enjoy snacks, and just relax. The staff was very friendly and added to the overall enjoyment of the stay.",5,2023,06,14
30,Beyonc√© in Barcelona getaway. I have never been to Spain before and when my daughter suggested it it was a No brainer,I was honestly very disappointed and dissatisfied with the service.   My sister in law who is a travel agent booked this trip for us to see our favorite artist Beyonc√©.  Having been a regular traveler toother Hyatt properties I was super excited,3,2023,06,12
30,Excellent hotel to stay,"Excellence hotel, the only issue is it is little far from tourist spot. We loved the club lounge, especially Mack, the server at the lounge, he is very helpful. Highly recommend this hotel. The breakfast is good, we just wish they will change the menu, otherwise it would be boring after couple days.",5,2023,06,11
30,Pricey and mediocre,"I stayed at this property out of Hyatt ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù, but the cost did not match the product received. The room was not ready at checkin time, the front desk tried to say they ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù me but I was put into the same room type I‚Äôd booked. The layout and all the mirrors in the bathroom area are disorienting, there is no safe provided in the room. The Nespresso machine was nice, but only decaf pods were provided. The Skyfall lounge was much smaller than expected and a snooze (boring). We paid for a rate including breakfast, but had to leave at 6am. The hotel offered to prepare a to-go breakfast. I expected a muffin/bagel or similar. We were provided tuna sandwiches, which were likely leftover from the ‚ÄúMarket‚Äù. I‚Äôve stayed at many Hyatts and this is probably the worst/most underwhelming property at which we‚Äôve stayed. ",2,2023,06,11
30,Mixed feelings: Modern hotel. Good service. Appalling ‚Äúsuite‚Äù.,"We were invited to a wedding in Barcelona on June 2nd. Because of the F1 weekend most hotels in Barcelona almost doubled in price and were non-refundable.
The hotel is way out of town, about 15 minutes from the airport and located in an industrial area with not much going on. Taxis are available at all times.
We booked a Regency Suite High Floor de Luxe, with Club Access for almost ‚Ç¨500 per night, which looked great on the pictures of the Hyatt website. Room #2410
I can really say that it was by far the most depressing and the worst ‚Äúsuite‚Äù we ever stayed in.
We entered the ‚Äúsuite‚Äù and came into a small and very dark ‚Äúsitting room‚Äù without windows!
Behind a divider was the small bedroom: The bed was placed opposite the large window.
The bedroom was so small and narrow that on one side of the bed there was no room for a nightstand!
Every hotel bed should have a night stand with a lamp etc on both sides of the bed, certainly for that price!
To look outside, you would have to sit on the bed. No daylight came into the sitting room.
Never ever have we stayed in a suite, with NO WINDOW  in the sitting area!
Because of the darkness in the room, there was an unpleasant and foul smell.
The bathroom was great, well lit and very well appointed.
Fortunately, we had Club Access and could spend time in the daylight.
The Club amenities were great as well. Highly recommended.
The staff overall were very nice and helpful.
Hence our‚Äùmixed feelings‚Äù: Our ‚Äúsuite‚Äù was appalling and depressing and that for ‚Ç¨500 per night.
The hotel is very modern and pleasant with professional staff and good service.
The Club Lounge was one of the best we ever had.
Beware when you book a Regency Suite High Floor de Luxe that the pictures on the website are deceptive and you could well end up with a dark and depressing room without any natural light in the sitting room and no nightstand on one side of the bed, like room #2410.
5 stars for the hotel, not even 1 star for our Suite, in spite of the well appointed bathroom.

",3,2023,06,05
30,Nice place to stay.,"Fantastic breakfast, easy to reach via bus from/ to airport (approx. 15 minutes), close to metro to travel to city center.  Small outdoor swimming pool, unfortunately not a lot of room to enjoy the sun. ",4,2023,06,05
30,Lovely hotel!,"Everything was wonderful! check in process was a breeze, wonderful staff, large room and clean, beautiful bathroom with great amenities.  Skyfall is quite nice. About 30 minutes from the city center thru the metro which us conveniently located across the street from the hotel. Will be back here when visiting Barcelona.
",5,2023,06,02
30,Stunning view and must stay in location.,"I booked this hotel last minute, and I wish I had stayed longer because it exceeded my expectations and made me want to come back to Barcelona and stay here again. Thank you so much! When I arrived, I was blown away by how beautiful and modern the hotel was. I felt completely submerged by the relaxed and zen environment. Hyatt hotel has really done something amazing to make sure guest enjoy the city of Barcelona in a fun, convenient and unforgettable way. ",5,2023,05,30
30,Awesome stay,"Really friendly, customer service, and they accommodate your every need. Location isnt great for tourism, but we just needed a nice place to stay for one night and this certainly fit the bill. Highly recommended if you want to be treated well and be very comfortable.  The Regency club lounge is especially exceptional and worth the upgrade partin",5,2023,05,29
30,"They went t to Barcelona for a couple of days prior to getting on a cruise, and this hotel is perfect very centrally loc","The hotel was very nice and a quiet neighborhood, very modern and with all the amenities. The staff was also very nice. Taxis were always available in front of the lobby which is very convenient. I highly recommend this hotel. The breakfast that was available was also pretty good.",5,2023,05,28
30,Great hotel close to airport,"My husband and I stayed overnight on our way back from Lisbon for our return flight back to Northern California. Nice rooms, and the Terrum restaurant was excellent as a choice for us to have dinner since we checked in a bit after 3,  this hotel is not close to the center of Barcelona.  Great accommodations for a close to airport hotel. ",5,2023,05,24
30,The best Hyatt at this area L'Hospitalet de Llobregat,"This was our second visit and once again the hotel is perfect only 10 minutes from El Prat Internacional Airport . The rooms simply AMAZING as the entire Hotel . Not to close to Barcelona center you need a car and in 15‚Äô you are in the city center with the Barcelona Port , Las Ramblas etc . Nothing more to add since our last visit in May 2022. ",5,2023,05,20
30,A night in the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower,"We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower for a night after flying into Barcelona. It is close to the airport which made driving there after our flight very easy. The Terrum Restaurant in the hotel served delicious food and our server was incredibly professional. The rooms were clean and the view as gorgeous, looking over the southern part of the city and the Mediterranean.",5,2023,05,20
30,Exceeding my expectations,"I was very impressed with a Hyatt experience. And they met our every need. The rooms were very well suited. The food was outstanding. Wh I go back to Barcelona, I will use them again. The staff is very friendly and attentive and they make sure that your every need is met.",5,2023,05,20
30,Speechless!,"I was visiting Barcelona to celebrate my recent promotion in my company. When the team found out, they upgraded me to a suite. Heidi and Rut on the front desk were awesome! The view in the suite of Barcelona was beautiful. Breakfast is was great, lovely variety of option and the breakfast were incredible. Always smiling and taking care of you also. I will be back.",5,2023,05,17
30,Great Choice for Barcelona,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during our Spain vacation. Front Desk managed to provide 2 rooms next to each other. Rooms were quite spacious. Although hotel is far from touristy attractions and required taxis to go anywhere, overall I would say it was a great choice. I did not venture outside of the hotel so I am not sure whether there are any nearby restaurants, but onsite restaurant was good one. Best part was its Regency Club. It provided top of the class breakfast with so many choices. ",5,2023,05,14
30,Very slow service on front desk,"Overall, the hotel is average given the cost of the rooms. The lock on my room didn‚Äôt work properly, my keycard was disabled half way through my stay and the front desk said I had checked out.. In one instance, the front desk charged a guest for the room when it had already been pre-paid, leading to long queues and delays when trying to get things resolved. Breakfast was nice, the views are amazing from the higher floors. They just need to be more attentive and work a bit quicker! Separating concierge services from the front desk checkin would make a big difference ",2,2023,05,07
30,Amazing Hotel ,Stayed here for one night prior to boarding my Princess Cruise Ship.  ONE OF THE BEST NIGHTS EVER!!  Concierge service was divine!  Can't wait to come back.  Food and service beyond reproach.  You will love it here! ,5,2023,05,06
30,Outstanding Hotel,By far the most outstanding Hyatt hotel I have ever visited.   He quality of amenities and service was the absolute best.  From the moment I arrived until the moment I left I was treated with great efficiency.  The customer service exceeded all my expectations.  ,5,2023,05,04
30,Barcelona's Exceptional Hotel,"From the moment we walked in the front door, we were made to feel very welcome by the front desk staff.  Mr. Rodrigo Gomes and all the staff at the Barcelona Hyatt Tower went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant a possible. The room was outstanding and the shower was a treat.  The breakfast buffett was excellent.",5,2023,05,03
30,Excellent experience,"Stayed in an executive suite high floor city view the facilities were excellent the suite suite was clean nice comfy bed bath tub with jacuzzi and shower also free snacks and drinks to be had at the regency club 
Overall very satisfied with my stay will defiantly book again ",5,2023,05,01
30,Paid 200 dollars for nothing,I accidentally made a reservation on Tripadvisor Plus for April 28 instead of May 28. I called back the same day to report the mistake and they told me to contact the Hyatt. The Hyatt would do absolutely nothing to apply my $200 to the correct date so they just took my money and I had to book another hotel for the correct date in May. Robbery!,1,2023,04,30
30,Exceptional staff,"It‚Äôs the people that make a place special. I loved staying here.  The welcome when I arrived, the breakfast, restaurant and bar staff were kind and attentive.  Food in the restaurant was good.  For me this hotel is really comfy and the staff are top notch. Well done",5,2023,04,29
30,Cocktail bar to forget,"For such type of hotel the service and quality of the cocktail bar is terrible. Also the quality of the restaurant is below average. Short menu, people not able to answer questions about it and extremely dark ",1,2023,04,16
30,Awesome  Experiance,"Service, Staff, Rooms, Bars was excellent, easy access to Metro and Bus, Plenty to explore in the vicinity, Very friendly and Very HELPFULL. 
Staff goes out of their way to guide and explain if you want to go sight see, The Regency Lounge was a triple bonus and the food and snacks, drinks provided was plentiful. will definitely be back and back and back. I can recommend to every one, If I could afford to travel every quarter I would go back. Thanks Hyatt Regency Barcelona Towers I fully enjoyed my stay. ",5,2023,04,13
30,Exceptional,"The best hotel. Our absolute favourite. The staff go above and beyond for you. The location, the decor, just incredible. This is our 2nd time staying here and certainly wont be our last. Thank you once again. Book it!! It will not disappoint. Special mention it imen on reception who is the best there is.",5,2023,04,10
30,Excellent Property with Superb management,"We really liked the stay and and the staff. The staff was extremely co-operative. When we wanted to go to some place, the person at the counter showed us how to go, came out of the hotel, called the Taxi, and explained the way to the Taxi driver. We had lounge access, but the lounge access was closed due to some internal issues. The general manager saw us discussing, immediately intervened  and shifted us to another location. We were served with excellent vegetarian snacks and a very good local gin. Hats off to the General Manager Mr.Rodrigo Gomes. All the staff we met had smiles on their faces everytime, were extremely co-operative and helpful. One can see what one gm can do.",5,2023,04,08
30,Great service when come early,We got to the hotel early as our flight landed first thing in the morning. Our rooms were not ready and we had 2 rooms. Rodrigo said he does not have the rooms available yet but he gave us complimentary access to the lounge. The lounge was huge and had drinks for adults and kids. There was breakfast food and some different food later on. Not crazy selection but pretty good to get us through the morning. Took a quick nap and kids watched iPads. Then Rodrigo came to us around 1230pm to let us know room was ready. Great service. Good size rooms.,5,2023,03,26
30,Great out of the city location,"Pros:
-Amazing staff who were super helpful
With making sure we had what we needed with four rooms. The front desk team was so kind and helpful making sure we knew how to access the metro across the street
-very quiet, we got great sleep with limited noise from hallways and the outside
-superb housekeeping and cleanliness
-awesome shower
-complimentary water
-lobby lounge drinks and snacks/bar menu
-fun local and safe neighborhood to walk in that gave us a different experience than being in the touristy area
-Real Madrid spent the night in the hotel before their game!

Cons:
-30-40 min metro ride into the city, but very easy to do
-no coffee available in the lobby in the mornings (there is a cute coffee/bakery about a 10 min walk)
-our fridge was emptied of the food and drink we had in it and replaced with a minibar - very irritating to come home to warm drinks and fruit we were planning to have that evening 
-the pool in the ad is from the fitness club next door that is 18+ and the hotel pool is outdoors and was closed. 

We would stay again for sure, the staff is hands down the most amazing staff of any hotel I‚Äôve stayed in. I wish I knew everyone‚Äôs names who helped us to mention them specifically.",4,2023,03,25
30,One of the best hotels in Barcelona,"We did not want to be in the city center on this visit to Barcelona, as we were getting down from our transatlantic cruise and were staying for two days before we proceeded to Madrid. The young lady at the entrance counter was extremely efficient and helpful, she even helped us with lur luggage up to our room! The hotel itself is modern, very clean and has everything one could want, including an excellent breakfast buffet and a very good dining room, with extremely efficient and helpful staff who take their time with the guests.  We heard there is a beautiful bar with tapas on the top, but we did not go. Our room has a lovely window with electric drapes. with a great view of the surroundings. It is a bit far from the city center, but we were able to go to Botafumeiro Retaurant and did not find it too far. Hyatt is very good, even in Barcelona!",5,2023,03,22
30,Barcelona Hyatt near airport,"I chose this property because it's only 10+ min from the airport and only wish I had more time there to enjoy it's amenities.  The service and atmosphere was superior but the restaurant and room service was not available after midnight.  I ordered a sandwhich from the ""market"" which was not great.",5,2023,03,15
30,Stay during conference,"Hotel is very nice. Rooms are spacious. Stuff very friendly and helpful. Gym needs some updates. A bit remote from the city center, but 10-15 cab ride will get you there. There is a huge mall within 5 mins drive.",4,2023,03,13
30,Good hotel for a conference,"Nice hotel rooms, good breakfast. Amazing bar at the top of the hotel.
Was there for a conference, would stay again if location is convenient for the stay. Quite some distance to the city, close to the airport. ",4,2023,03,11
30,High standard conference hotel,"Very well presented and maintained conference hotel. All staff were friendly and delivered outstanding service. Hotel lobby and bar decor is nice with several seating options. Room was luxurious and cleaned extensively every day.

Extensively mirrored bathroom as you walk into the room is unusual and slightly dark but the facilities (shower and double sink etc) are modern and in good condition. ",5,2023,03,10
30,First Trip to Spain - Birthday Celebration,"What a beautiful hotel - filled with staff who love people and love their jobs!
On Day 1, we were greeted by Roderigo, a true professional, who gave us a welcome glass of champagne as it was my 75th birthday celebration trip - and a bedroom upgrade for me and my daughter and husband. 
We stayed for 4 nights, and whichever department we used, we were treated with warmth, kindness and respect!
In the Terrum restaurant the food was really delicious, and the service we received from Jose was wonderful!
Eusebio and his breakfast team were so welcoming and friendly every morning. The buffet breakfast was superb - such a choice, to mention a few things - fresh fruits, delicious pastries, fresh cold meats, cooked breakfast too, pancakes, and even champagne! Unforgettable! 
Cisco looked after us in the lounge bar for 2 evenings and 2 delicious suppers, and we felt very well cared for- so kind! 
More was our housekeeper and kept our rooms looking so clean and tidy one of the best standard I have ever received!
Gemma in Reception also looked after us when we needed a taxi and explained to the driver what we needed, making it effortless for us! To sum up, the staff here gave us a memorable experience of my trip to Barcelona. Thank you so much. I wish you all well!

30,Luxury!!,"We stayed in this hotel and enjoyed the city of Barcelona using the Gyatt as a base. We were welcomed by a friendly staff and  enjoyed the luxury rooms and the extensive breakfast buffet. It was absolutely a pleasure to stay in this hotel!!
Paul & Annemieke Nonnekens",5,2023,02,13
30,Fantastic service!,"I had an excellent stay at Hyatt Barcelona Tower in November 2022. 
As a frequent European traveler I can say that I have received the warmest welcome in years from this hotel. The staff were friendly, efficient and professional. The hotel seems designed to cater for large conferences, away days etc‚Ä¶ However, both business and leisure travellers are equally well looked after. 
",5,2023,02,05
30,Good place for stay,"A best in class hotel located conveniently with ample travel options. The rooms are spacious, have good facilities and comfortable spaces. The breakfast served has good variety, but very limited if you are a vegetarian. However, orange juice provided is fresh, and the team helps you in any way they can. Recommend if you are in Barcelona and want to stay away from the city center. ",4,2023,02,05
30,"Wonderful hotel, close to Fira de Barcelona","Wonderful hotel, close enough yet far enough from Fira de Barcelona.  Great and attentive staff, clean rooms, full bar and restaurant, amazing pool facilities, and an incredible view of the city from the top at the Skyfall Club!  Will come back next year!",5,2023,02,04
30,"Incredible Service, Incredible Views, Incredible Hotel","I had the luxury of visiting this hotel twice recently and staying at two separate suites. I have to say that the hotel itself is immaculate. The design is modern, sleek and beautiful. The rooms themselves are luxurious as well as comfortable. The staff is beyond helpful and was exceeding expectations every step of the way. A special shoutout to Roger, who was not only able to expedite my check in, but was also able to find a way to expeditiously solve any problems that could come up for any guest during my stay. In my case he was able to locate numerous locations for me and come up with great directions without overcomplicating things. In another guests case, he was literally able to pull strings with a nearby hospital to ensure proper medical care.

Roger was truly a jack of all trades and is a paragon of customer service. If you have the luxury of staying in this hotel, I hope you have the luxury of meeting him as well, as he will ensure your trip is perfect.",5,2023,01,16
30,Holiday Getaway,"This Hotel is World Class and Luxurious, Staff are very attentive and have exceptional customer service. Breakfast is extremely great, with very kind and attentive staff . The hotel is centrally located, a lot of points of interest are close by. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,01,07
30,Excellent Hotel in Barcelona,This is a fantastic hotel to stay at when you are in Barcelona. It is 10 minutes from the airport and 20 minutes from the city center using the Metro. You are away from all the noise and can get a quiet night of sleep. The staff provides outstanding service and the breakfast buffet is outstanding! You also have free access to the Metropolitan Club which has 4 levels of equipment. Special thanks to Rodrigo for going out of his way to provide excellent service.,5,2023,01,02
30,Spacious rooms with spa and gym,"Hotel rooms in the city center are usually very small. Hotel rooms in Hyatt are modern and very spacious. Great views. Solid breakfast. Spa with good gym in the next building - also rarity with the hotels in Barcelona. Hyatt does not locate in the city center but the nearest metro station is within 100 meters so location was not a problems for us. Very helpfull, polite and capable staff. I highly recommend Hyatt! ",5,2023,01,02
30,Five Stars!!!,"I am a Globelist and stayed 3 nights with my family.  After a long flight and at check in, Roger (the manager) greeted us, helped us with our luggages and took us to our rooms.  Both our rooms were upgraded to a suite due to my status.  They were beautiful suites with rain shower and had all the amenities.  The Regency Club was amazing with delicious breakfast, tapas in the evenings and snacks during the days.  And also had access to a full breakfast in the mornings!  On our last night, my room was on the floor below the Skyfall Club and the music was a bit loud (light sleeper) and I had casually mentioned it at check out to Gemma and they comp my last night for the hassle.  We had a fantastic time and hope to return one day.  Keep up the good work which had exceeded our expectations and thank you for making our trip an amazing one!",5,2022,12,30
30,Very good hotel,"Highly recommend, better than expectations in every aspect: food, the rooms are clean, customer service, gear value for money, great location, very comfortable rooms. We will definitely come here again every chance that we have. ",5,2022,12,16
30,Modern and well equipped hotel,"Very modern and very attractive hotel. Rooms are spacious and well equipped. Top floors with city view are recommended. Don't bother with club access, it has little to offer. Very limited staff numbers, but they all try hard to help with anything you need. The restaurant is excellent. ",4,2022,12,13
30,Modern look with good rooms,I stayed at this hotel in November 2022. I was on business trip hence did not get much time to explore all the facilities of the hotel. The rooms are quiet nice and big and even bigger bathroom. Its just 7 mins drive from the hotel. The hotel is far from city center but the best part is there is a metro station right across the hotel and there are direct trains to Catalunya station(City center). The breakfast spread is quiet nice and big. They also have a Cocktail Club called Skyfall which is located on the rooftop giving a 360 degree view of the city.,5,2022,12,06
30,Don't Let The Distance to Downtown Deter You,"We were skeptical in choosing the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower due to its distance to the downtown area.  It turned out to be an excellent choice.  It was a 3-minute walk to the metro station, a 10-ride metro pass was only 7.95Euros, and can reach most tourist attractions in about 30 minutes.  Hotel was in excellent condition.  As a globalist, we received free upgrade to a suite, Regency Club had long hours, great breakfast in hotel restaurant, and every staff that we interacted with was very friendly and helpful.   The front desk staff even helped up to book tickets for an ABBA tribute band benefit concert that took place in the hotel's convention center.  We will consider this hotel when we return to this city.",5,2022,12,02
30,"Highly recommended, exceeded expectations","Highly recommended, exceeded expectations, Globalist member , the room was upgraded to a suite high floor in advance, in the early check-in information, I wrote that I needed a crib, and the crib was placed in the room in advance before check-in, which was great.  When checking in, the front desk staff helped us transport our luggage to the elevator, which was very considerate.room is very quiet !we sleep good ! The breakfast and evening refreshments in the regency club were very good, which greatly exceeded expectations, and the staff and management were very attentive, which also exceeded expectations.  The only thing is that I was charged $25, probably for parking, but theoretically I shouldn't have to pay.  This is a small problem, I will stay here at the end of the month, I believe the hotel will be easy to help me solve this small problem, thank you",5,2022,11,23
30,Sustainability in packaging summit,The stay at Hyatt tower BCN was outstanding. the service and the room was according my expectations and enabled a good experience in BCN. Price / Service ratio was extraordinary good due to lower rates for the faire.,5,2022,11,08
30,Exceptional Experience-You Will Be Amazed!,"Our stay at the Hyatt Regency in Barcelona was exceptional. From our initial greeting by Andrea at the front desk to the lovely note from Adrian in our room, this stay exceeded our expectations. Before entering the room, Roger from Guest Relations met us at the Regency Club to welcome us to the hotel. He gave us an overview of the city and the hotel, brought our bags to the room, and served us with excellence throughout our four-day stay. As one example, he repeatedly attempted to get us tickets to La Sagrada Familia only to later learn that their web site was not working. We will be forever grateful to him.
Breakfast at the restaurant was also exceptional allowing us to order from the menu and providing a large selection of delicious hot and cold offerings. There was also a significant gluten-free area to my appreciation personally having Celiac requirements. Our server each morning was Amanda (and others) taking care of us with engaging service. Also, Walter and others at the Regency Club in the evenings took care of our every need including gluten-free options.
Housekeeping was also wonderful with immaculate cleanliness and a large array of lotions and other amenities. Our upgrade was much appreciated. Lovely view of the city surroundings on the 24th floor.
Overall, this Hyatt property exceeded our imaginations in every way and especially with every staff interaction. As Lifetime Titanium with Marriott and Globalist with Hyatt, my experience has made Hyatt preferential to me in seeking out Hyatt properties across the world because of its consistency. The property is a short 20-minute ride by subway from Barcelona center-city with 10 entries for a mere $7.5 euro. I highly recommend this property.",5,2022,11,05
30,Nice family stay,"Warm welcome, great service, good value for money.  Travelled as family of four, children ages 11 and 13 were made very welcome.  Large comfortable bedrooms.  Nice public spaces.  Very handy for airport but also only 15 mins on metro to central/historic areas of city",5,2022,10,31
30,Elegant Stay in the city,"Perfect for short stays in Barcelone, close to Airport & Port & City center... Very good tower club with the views of Barcelona... Rooms also very elegant, Membership lounge area has very good service & options for drink & snacks",4,2022,10,30
30,Fantastic staff and hotel,The staff was fantastic and so was the hotel.  Breakfast and the staff were great as well.  Hotel is a short taxi from the gothic quarter.  After an LONG day of travel we opted to eat at their restaurant for dinner and it did not disappoint!  The hotel has access to a gym which has great facilities,5,2022,10,30
30,Excellent and welcoming stay,"Wonderful stay!  At checkin, Rodrigo assisted us.  Wow, what an impression he made. I had to wait a few minutes as he was helping other guests and it wasn't very long and totally acceptable.  He offered me a drink as I waited.  Rodrigo then confirmed my Globalist reservation and told me he'd get me a good room with a good view.  He then called someone really quick, and in a few minutes, Alberto (director of Operations) came to welcome me and offer his assistance for anything I needed.  Rodrigo then completed the reservation and helped with luggage and showed us to our room.  It was an amazing view, large room and very comfortable.   The hotel was in great shape and very welcoming. The hotel was very easy to get to from the airport on the city bus - just a 10 minute ride.  There is a nice park right next to the hotel with walking trails.  We had to leave early the next morning before breakfast was ready in the restaurant/club but Rodrigo had a ""to-go"" bag ready for us.  Both Rodrigo and Alberto went out of their way to make our stay fantastic.  Rodrigo and Alberto anticipated our every need and were ready to help with any need.  Every employee we came in contact with were happy to help and very pleasant. We wished we were staying longer, and will definitely stay there again if ever in Barcelona.",5,2022,10,29
30,Very comfortable Stay,"We had a wonderful stay at this Hyatt location. Amazing views of the city and not only a gorgeous room, but a very comfortable night of rest as well. This is a beautiful hotel. The room amenities and the restaurants are very nice.",5,2022,10,28
30,Good stay for business,"Nice Hotel, lobby is very impressive. Was here for a conference, facilities were good. Breakfast nice. Room is good, would maybe expect that little extra from a five star hotel, but overall good. Sky bar is cool! The area around is not very nice though, and in rush hour it took as about 30 min to get to Pla√ßa de Catalunya. Taxi ride was about 20 eur, same from to the airport (10-15 min)",4,2022,10,27
30,Excellent hotel - highly recommended,"Exceptional customer service, high quality food, great buffet breakfast and an easy location between the city and airport. A very high quality hotel with comfortable and luxurious rooms. Highly recommend and would say again.",5,2022,10,26
30,Great venue,"Excelent location for conference, very good breakfast and service, great view from the top bar.10 minutes away from the airport, Subway 5 minutes away. Aprox 40 minutes away from Placa Cataluna. Top Hotel!",5,2022,10,24
30,Perfect Professional Palace,"Very beautiful hotel near the airport and away from the noisy city. Restaurants are awesome, staff is courteous and hospitable. Our suite was fantastic with room galore and a bathroom of the ages. The Regencey Club was chill and spacious fir hanging out. I would recommend Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower highly.",5,2022,10,23
30,"nice hotel, ugly surrounding, not really Barcelona","ok for a 2 day business trip if you really only need a hotel close to the airport. Not recommeded for vacation or of you want to see Bcn. The area is very, very ugly and run down, constant motorway noise and the view over enfdess housing blocks takes away a lit from the 5 star experience. You do not know you are in Bcn there. But very friendly staff, great service, good facilitiess, 10 min from airport. ",3,2022,10,19
30,Nice hotel only the location is less,"The hotel is fully equipped and super clean. The skyfall bar in the top has a great view and the staff is very friendly. The area where the hotel is located is not ideal for a visit to the city, but it is fine for business meetings.",5,2022,10,17
30,Didn't feel like a Hyatt,"Understaffed (no bell service, for example). No airport shuttle. Didn't feel like a Hyatt, but an off-brand local outfit. Rooms were clean and quiet, and what staff they did have were nice and professional, though, so that's something. I guess if you couldn't find something better in the center of town this would be an acceptable choice.",3,2022,10,12
30,Great Alternative to Staying in the Touristy Areas,"The HR is a beautiful hotel, conveniently located on L1 at a fair price.  The staff treat you as a welcomed guest, the rooms are modern and fresh as are the properties amenities.   I much preferred my stay over previous stays in touristy areas",5,2022,10,09
30,Stunning hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night before our cruise. I was blown away by the beauty of this hotel as soon as we entered.

The staff were very friendly and showed us where everything was

Our room was amazing, it was pure luxury!. 

We would love to come back and stay for a long weekend",5,2022,10,05
30,Hidden Gem,"This is a fabulous hotel. The pictures do not do justice to how nice this place actually is. We stayed at the duplex on the 25th floor and the experience was amazing. The staff, from the receptionist Imen to manager Marielle were hands-on first class. The location is not right in the center of city, but it is not as far as we thought. Taxi into town is about 15 min, and train about 30 min. Would definitely come back here. Check out the pictures.",5,2022,09,25
30,Excellent quality,"The hotel is 10min drive from the airport,
A 20min drive to city centre barcelona,
5 star hotel lives up to its name,
Room service arrived within 15mins. 
And the gym and spa are far bigger than other 5 star hotels I've been to. 
The Restaurant is fairly prices and the watier picked the correct wine to go with my main. (Critical) 

The reception was maned at all times and they spoken English and spainish, 

The room was clean and bed was perfect.

Am finding it difficult to fault this hotel. 

I would score this hotel 98/100

",5,2022,09,24
30,Wonderful property in Barcelona - with a view!,"This might be one of the nicest high rise hotel in Barcelona. We liked it because it was more remote so we did not have to worry about noise and partying people in the middle of the night. The access to the center of the city was easy. What sets this hotel apart is the hospitality. Hyatt seems to understand hospitality very well but this property stands out. Everyone we met was warm, friendly and professional. At breakfast, after one day, the staff knew us and our preferences. My wife makes her own tea in the room and the staff would greet us with glasses of ice so she could have iced tea. They'd make my cappuccino without asking.
The GM, Alberto, made everything easy for us. If we needed anything, we just used WhatsApp to connect with him. Our room was wonderful and we had a great view of Sagrada Familia and the Olympic Torch from the 1992 Summer Olympics.
The Regency Club was open and working all day and into the evening. Some other Hyatt properties either do not have a Regency Club, close it or offer limited service. Not here. The Regency Club was a great place to quickly get a snack or beverage after a long day of touring the city.
You will love this property because of the service. We will come back to this property again. ",5,2022,09,24
30,Very Welcoming Hotel with Friendly Staff,The staff at this hotel are so very helpful.  I fell ill during some of my time in Barcelona but as a solo female traveler I felt very comfortable and looked after at this hotel.  Special thanks to Walter from the Room Service Team who was very kind to check in on me to make sure I was okay.,5,2022,09,21
30,Excellent service and facilities,"The Hyatt is a little out of town, but very well connected to roads and metro etc. The building is spotlessly clean and modern. Beds and rooms really good and comfortable. The staff are really helpful and friendly and make you feel at home quickly. Alberto the manager and Merry on front desk deserves a mention. The Tower club is a great place to relax and take a drink and snack. And the breakfast is delicious and the service again is fantastic. Highly recommended for all travellers including families.",5,2022,09,19
30,Large hotel with management and staff focused like their own business,I visited the hotel in the most difficult of circumstances when my flight was cancelled. The manager Alberto and his team offered support when I was exhausted. Michael on the bar rustled up the best cappuccino outside of Milano. The attached health club is superb . All in all the whole team were excellent - it felt like I was in a small family hotel. Very different to all the other airport hotels I‚Äôve visited.,5,2022,09,18
30,"Beautiful hotel 15 min from Airport, convenient metro L1 to city center","Hotel is situated in a nice building. Nice room. Hotel staffs are friendly.  The manager is very enthusiastic in following a lost item of my colleague. Coming from the airport, taxi fare is 15.50 euro, the taxi didn‚Äôt have change so he took the whole 20 euro  note. Going to the airport from the hotel is 17.50 euro +++,  the taxi asked for 23 euro may be because of two luggages. My advice is prepare exact change for the taxi fares.",5,2022,09,17
30,Great aparthotel,"Accomadating excellent reception staff
Clean and comfortable suite of rooms
Close to Metro for Catalonia square
Annex to main hotel but could use ALL facilities
Freewifi 
Location for Barcelona centre great a few stops on the Metro
Taxis to centre about 14 euros",4,2022,09,14
30,One of my favorite hotel stays!,"Adrian, at check in, was great and extremely helpful. He made the check in experience seamless and escorted me to the lifts - which made the first time experience a little more personalized. The lobby is spotless and i'm not sure when this property opened but it's well maintained. The conference space is quite large and the bar is just behind the lobby.

The Regency club was also well maintained and offered significant value to frequent members. There was a happy hour, meeting space, and plenty of seating - which offered networking opportunities.

I was on the 23rd floor so on Friday night, I could hear the music from the rooftop but it was fine. There's so much to do in Barcelona, I wasn't going to sleep early anyways! Something to keep in mind for staying on a high floor on weekends. I stopped by the rooftop lounge but did not have an opportunity to party there. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. I felt very comfortable at this hotel. There are taxi's that are stationed outside and readily available for rides. They take credit cards but I don't believe you can charge rides to the hotel. The hotel is about a 10 minute right from BCN airport and roughly 15 - 20 minutes from Barcelona Proper.

The gym was amazing. This was the first hotel that I stayed at that offered access to a full gym verses a fitness center. You need to request access through the front desk - which was easy enough. ",5,2022,09,12
30,Wonderful Hotel !,We arrived 3 days prior to a Mediterranean cruise to explore Barcelona. We used our Hyatt Discoverist points to book a suite.  The service by the staff is awesome !  Laura checked us in and  followed up with us to ensure we were satisfied with the room . Rodrigo in the evenings was very helpful. We stayed over one more night after the cruise and quick visit to Madrid at Hyatt Centric.  Paloma was very helpful that stay. The hotel is very close to the airport and a short walk to the Metro.  There are usually Taxis in front.  Very modern and clean facilities. Definitely would go back !,5,2022,09,08
30,Barcelona Hyatt Regency Tower Hotel A++,"Stay here you will not be disappointed.
Beautiful building in and out and close to the airport. The kind of property one would enjoy staying at for one night or much longer. Great staff, safe area, so far one of the best hotels on our vacation in Eu Europe‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..",5,2022,09,06
30,Trip to Barcelona,"We've stayed in Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower for the first time and Everything was amazing, View, Room, Staff, breakfast. Our Room was upgraded even for additional amount, but it worth it. For sure we will come back",5,2022,09,06
30,Great stay,"We enjoyed staying here and the breakfast was very good. Comfortable room with a nice view. Staff was very helpful specially from the reception (Laura and the other girl I forgot her name). The only thing was that me and my friend wanted to have something from 24market in the middle of the night so we asked the guy who was standing near the lobby if the 24 market is open and he just answered as ""I dont know"" so l thought I had mistaken if he is staff or not so I asked again if he is working from the hotel and said yes. I repeated my question about the 24market but still he answered us ""I dont know"" .Since it was mention from the website and from our booking information that the 24market is open 24hours, We went to check but nobody's there so we got nothing .Not a big deal but atleast staff have to be aware about their facilities inside the hotel. Anyway,it was a great stay.",5,2022,09,05
30,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff. Everyone was so nice. Would stay again. Their restaurant Terrum was delicious.

Stayed 3 nights and took quite a few taxis while we were there, Taxi drivers still call the hotel Hesperia Tower, so caused some confusion when we asked to taken to Hyatt Regency‚Äîmake sure you have the address to hand to avoid confusion. 
",5,2022,09,04
30,One of the best hotel experiences in innovation and food.,"Totally excided our expectations in terms of innovation and architectural design, along with excellent food and well trained, friendly and experienced staff..  Rooms were spacious and well designed.  Would stay again.",5,2022,09,01
30,Fabulous hotel,"We can‚Äôt express enough how awesome our hotel was. We are Hyatt family. They never disappointed us. From  beginning of our married life till now and my adult children also started to stay in Hyatt only! Their hospitality, food, accommodations everything So far nothing can disappoint us ! Way to go Hyatt!!!",5,2022,09,01
30,Excellent customer service,"Less than 10 minutes from the airport, but within easy striking distance of the city centre, the outstanding feature is the customer service. Seems like a conscious aspiration to be excellent in this regard, but nothing wrong with that. I don‚Äôt always like ‚Äòcorporate‚Äô hotels but the staff being so personable makes the experience more enjoyable. ",5,2022,09,01
30,Great for pre cruise stay,We stayed here one night pre cruise. The Hotel looks very modern and the Lobby with large screen looks great. This hotel used to be known as the Hesperia tower before the Hyatt rebrand. The room was very spacious and modern and we were given one on a high floor. We checked out the bar on the top floor and it was fairly quiet for a Friday but had fantastic views. All Staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful befitting of Hyatt standards. The Front desk gave good recommendations for nearby places to eat (a place where the locals go close to the hotel) which was good as there was not much around the area late at night. Checkout was great and reception helped us get a taxi and direct them to the right cruise terminal for us. Would stay again if back in Barcelona.,4,2022,08,21
30,Hyatt regency Barcelona,"Amazing hotel, stunning decor ans not too far from main city centre. absolutely amazing cocktails made by a gentleman called Michael! I had a strawberry Mojito pictures below as well as a mai Thai made specially for me by Michael!",5,2022,08,21
30,High quality hotel with some remarks,"The hotel is great - the room equipment, sleeping quality and especially the breakfast are awesome. The location is far away from the City Center, so I would recommend this hotel only after the long fly or on case of late arrival in Barcelona - you can really enjoy the services and relax. Some negative comments are going currently to the outside pool, which is new built, but designed very bed and real cool water and also to the hotel staff regarding the add ons during the booking - the booking description and interpretation by the hotel staff was not clear and was a subject of small dispute.",4,2022,08,20
30,Great place to stay,Great view great service the house keepers where nice and professional. Front desk was very helpful even tho there was a misunderstanding with the billing since we where never there for breakfast and they where trying to add that to our bill but we gratify that issue. Parking lot was very secure since they have a gate that close around 9:00pm and opens at 8:00am and you need a QR to leave the building that only the front desk can give you. I will definitely go back to Barcelona and stay there again!,5,2022,08,16
30,"incredible views, fabulous suite close to airport.  Not close to activities but excellent value otherwise.","The suite on the top floor was fantastic, amazing views, and luxurious suite!  We've been to a lot of hotels and this was the largest and most impressive suite we've been to.  It's not close to any activities, but we booked 2 hotels in Barcelona.  An expensive one in Gothic Quarter, and this one for last 2 nights which was less expensive and closer to train and airport.  I am a Hyatt member so maybe this explained why I got what I believe is an incredible upgrade for the price I paid.",5,2022,08,15
30,Great Stay,"The hotel is well designed, clean and very appealing. The room was spacious and equipped with a powerful hairdryer, an iron and iron board, nice robes and towels. The mattress and the pillows were extremely comfortable (I'm very hard to please when it comes to that). Breakfast offered a wide variety of food (also gluten free options). The pool and pool area were not so big, but cute with a contemporary design, it also offered complementary cool & fruity water. All the staff was extremely friendly, professional and helpful. Just a little negative note is the main floor bar was slow at serving food.",4,2022,08,10
30,"Best place to be away,","What a gem, people are nothing but kind and informative. Minutes from the Metro (last stop on the red line) Incredibly safe and 25 min ride to everywhere. Make sure you eat either in the restaurant or anywhere else outside the neighbor. No real pleasant places to eat. ",5,2022,08,08
30,Was formerly Hisperia Hyiatt Regency delivers 4 out of 5 stars,"If you are an American like my dad and I, you must understand that the rooms in Europe are smaller than what we are used to, in the USA and it is more expensive. The room we got was over 200 because it had a nice view and it was high up on the tower. We got a deal for a two king sized bed room for $160 a night, when normally it is $200. I will give Hyiatt regency a high four star 4.5 stars out of 5 but here is why I can't fully give a 5 star. The facilities and ammeneties are nice, it is very modern but there is not continental free breakfast and breakfast can be $30 at the hotel. They offer good services like $75 to provide a doctor to come to your room, for a COVID test. You also have free WIFI and within walking distance, there are a few shops and a Turkish eatery. It is walking distance from Universitat de Barcelona. You are a 15 min train ride to Estadio De Camp Nou, which you can see from your room, along wtih views of the beach, and La Sagrada De Familia (give or take 15 min). Overall, it is worth it because the bathrooms are very nice. The room is a bit on the small side but for us it was enough. The nice young lady who speaks English at the front desk is very helpful. She gave us directions on the train station to the stadium and apologized for a rude guest checking in and interrupting us.  The people are very warm and friendly to visiting freigners, and quite helpful. Overall, I would recommend the hotel, if you have some cash to spend. Caveat it is the Hyiatt Regency, so It is not budge friendly though.",4,2022,08,03
30,Barceloan from the Hyatt Regency Tower,"The Staff in every area we went; served us with great satisfaction and professionalism. 
The front Desk girls on July 22 (Sorry I forgot their names), Rodrigo, Carlos and Eva at the breakfast restaurant, Ali at the dinner restaurant, the girls fixing our rooms (again I fo got their names), anyway ALL STAFF was wonderful.
PLEASE, PLEASE, Let them know that without there fabulous service the stay wouldn't be the great experience in Barcelona.",5,2022,07,30
30,High Class Stay in Barcel√≥na,"As a Globalist Hyatt member I got a suite upgrade! I was extremely happy with the service of everyone, Mermaid Meritxell , Sweet Mariel, and another lovely woman in reception and especially Roger, who made my stay wonderful! I also received an invite to the shopping mall La Roca Village outside town with a private driver.
 I was happy to use my points and was extremely content from everything! The suite was amazing and clean! Lots of water, comfortable bed & pillows, lots of space in closet, amazing bath! The club level was perfect comfort , and yes, the hotel is out of main area, but one simple metro away (30 min) just across the street, or 15 min by taxi (15-20‚Ç¨).
The hotel is Close to the airport as well.
It was a different experience staying in Barcel√≥na in this fancy hotel, and I loved it! Definitely coming back! ",5,2022,07,29
30,clean and pleasant,"Very nice and large room, outstanding fitting area for adults, nice and friendly staff, we will most definitely come back. Housekeeping was very friendly and professional and available in flexible times. We did not have breakfast so we can not review the food and beverages in the Azimoth restaurant. ",5,2022,07,28
30,Amazing hotel that eased our flight cancellation stress,"My husband and I had our flight back to New York cancelled. Around 9pm we had to scramble to book a hotel last minute and ended up choosing the Hyatt. We are SO SO SO thankful we went with this chose. Rodrigo at the reception desk gave us the best hospitality we‚Äôve EVER received in any hotel!!! We received a room upgrade, beers on the house, and had a taxi waiting for us the morning after to bring us to the airport.  We wish we stayed for longer than a night. Thank you so much for an amazing experience.  ",5,2022,07,25
30,"Probably the best hotel we have stayed at. While not in the middle of town, it is quiet and very comfortable.","While not in the middle of downtown or at the beach, it is easy enough to get to both.There is a small working class neighborhood a few minutes walk away that has grocers, pharmacies, etc. and is a pleasant place to walk and enjoy authentic Barcelona. We spent our last few days at the most expensive hotel on the beach and we both wished that we had stayed at the Hyatt. ",5,2022,07,24
30,Great service and location.,Overall experience was great and we noticed much better service than previously with Hesperia particularly in Club. New swimming pool just opened and brings additional satisfaction. All staff were extremely helpful particularly Rodrigo and Imen in reception and Walter in Club.,5,2022,07,23
30,Satisfait,"Very nice hotel and th staff ‚Ä¶ greating for all staff in breakfast ereas th are to much respecting people and educated‚Ä¶ greating from lobby staff Samira etc‚Ä¶
Next time I will be back and my family in this hotel we are enjoy 
Best regards ",5,2022,07,21
30,Excellent stay,"The hotel was above my expectations and the staff were exceptional. I was particularly impressed with the gym, which I used quite a bit whilst there. Shame the sun pool was not ready till our last day - the kids would have loved it. 
Micheal and the team at the bar were superb with their level of service.
Overall, a very good experience. We will be returning ",5,2022,07,21
30,Great people & service,"Fantastic staff that offer exceptional service. Pool access could be better, but still a nice hotel to stay in. Shuttle bus service to & from the airport should also be offered like many other hotel chains",4,2022,07,20
30,Great service and experience.,"I stay 150+ night per year in Hyatt and Hilton properties. This was the best service I have received in a long while. Rojer, manager, made it very special. He and all staff were very attentive and helped with any questions. 
The breakfast was superb and the adjunct fitness facility was incredible. 
The potty is very well maintained. The regency club is stuffed with drinks and food.",5,2022,07,13
30,Relaxing hotel,"All services on high level, you can relax after whole day visiting Barcelona attractions. Access to ftness centre with swimming pool increases the value.
Maybe location is not so favourable but the room with city view and close subway station compensates this. ",5,2022,07,13
30,Stay for the Staff,Only downside is how remote it is. Great for airport access. Amazing structure and even better staff. A faulty AC thermostat prompted the mgr to upgrade our room. Plus a bottle of cava. Good breakfast spread. We found a great local restaurant on an evening stroll 4 blocks away.,4,2022,07,08
30,i wont come back again,"the best service i receive during my stay in while i checked in , i had to call to remind my room to be cleaned, staff doesnt leave water in the room i had to call for it, the room service food quality is low, the staff doesnt always speak to you nicely , you got some polite staff and some very uninterested or rude, i dont know why but i been having a stomach ache during my stay drinking the hotel water , i know that coz as soon as i leave the stomach ache stop the same day as i was drinking different water. i received a letter the night before my checkout not to tell me to settle my bill 1 night before my checkout, it just really feel like the place is not welcoming ",2,2022,07,01
30,Bathroom glass door was almost falling off,"Bathroom glass doors upper hinge was broken and door was almost falling off. It took effort and time to communicate with hotel and get new room. First room was tired in all aspects - desperate need for renovating. Room was Regency Executive Suite King High Floor Deluxe City View, so not the worst choice you can make.
Good part of the hotel was concert size video screen with good built in audio broadcasting concerts and dj sets. This actually works and you can forgot that you are in the hotel.",3,2022,06,26
30,Best stay!,"This is the hands-down the best hotel I have ever been to! Everyone here is so friendly and helpful. The hotel is so clean, not to mention absolutely beautiful and has tons to do. When we first got to the hotel the airport had lost our luggage and we were devastated. There were two people in particular who really helped us get through that experience. Mary and Roger made everything better. We got our luggage three days later but if it weren't for them being so kind and giving and helpful the trip just wouldn't have been as great. I‚Äôm so thankful for them and will always return to this hotel and highly recommend it.",5,2022,06,25
30,Fantastic hotel and staff,"Checked into Barcelona Tower after full day of flying from Central Asia. Busy day as the Barcelona F1 race was being held the same weekend. Staff was amazing even with the hotel full with guests due to the race. My coworkers and I thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant, bar, and other amenities of the Tower, but the staff really made the visit enjoyable. Have recommended this hotel to many friends and business associates.",5,2022,06,23
30,Great experience,"This hotel was above and beyond our expectations. We arrived before check-in time after an 8 hour plane ride. They stored our bags and we spent the next 4 hours touring and they offered us cool water and help with our bags upon our return. The room was extremely clean, the shower most welcome after traveling and touring for almost 20 hours, the hotel quiet and the bed very comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2022,06,22
30,Costly yet slightly inconvenient.,"Overall the place was nice, had all the high end amenities that you would expect from a Hyatt however, besides the check in staff, who were very friendly and helpful, the rest of the staff (bartender, reception desk personnel after hours, room service, etc.) were less than helpful.  I wouldn't rate this Hyatt against others because besides the name and the quality of the hotel room, the experience was subpar.  I basically felt like I paid for a Tesla and what I got was an ""Almost new, Chevy Malibu"" thanks to the staff.  I wouldn't stay at this specific hotel again.  Not to mention the ridiculously expensive EVERYTHING!  Basically priced as if they were bringing in the food from outer space!  ",3,2022,06,22
30,Great Stay Twice!,"I traveled to Spain for the first time in May for a cruise  to the French Riviera on Virgin Voyages. From the time that me and my friends checked in we were greeted by friendly Hyatt staff. The check in process was seamless and we really appreciated that especially after traveling all day from the U.S. Later that evening we had dinner at the restaurant and our waiter(s) were so helpful! We enjoyed the food  and drinks and even spent time down in the lounge afterwards. We stayed for one night as our cruise was leaving the following day. However upon checkout we had a chance to meet the general manager of the property Adrian. He told us that we when we returned to the hotel after the cruise that he would make sure that we had rooms on higher floors with city views. They even arranged a taxi service to the dock for our ship. 

When we returned Adrian kept his promise and we were placed on floors 20 and 22 of the hotel with gorgeous city views. He was a real super star GM and made sure that we were well taken care of during both stays. I can't wait to revisit this property. It was a great stay!

Thanks,
Damar",5,2022,06,21
30,Excelente service,"We travel a lot and stay in many different hotels and what makes a hotel stand out more than anything is the level of service you receive and how much the staff cares about their guests. I can honestly say that Maite and Alberto the manager went above and beyond to make sure we had an excellent stay. From helping us with a new room to sending a welcome bottle of bubbly and even going as far as helping us make our special baby food in the kitchen blender. Hands down incredible attention to detail, they genuinely cared about our stay and well-being. This made our time at this hotel top notch and all else that may not have been perfect did not matter after the treatment we received from them.",5,2022,06,20
30,Barcelona Trip,"The hotel staff were amazing front desk & food & beverage team, hotel is clean, have a good selection of food, Regency Club is huge. Overall it was a great experience, I will definitely recommend the hotel. ",5,2022,06,18
30,Exploring Barcelona,"Great room -- spacious and beautiful view (#1006). Wished it were a bit closer to downtown Barcelona, but it was an easy cab ride to major sights. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and we enjoyed both restaurants as well as the breakfast buffet.",5,2022,06,17
30,"Barcelona 1 week,","Well great hotel, great service and nothing really to put a finger on, exept the payment the last day/night... We left the Hotel in the morning at 04, so I wanted to pay everything in advance before we left the hotel, but their computer was down. So when I came home I found a mistake in the payment, one breakfast to much x 4 people. This mistake was written to them and here 2 months later the money is still to come....
So ALLWAYS pay your bills before leving this hotel, we were nice as always, they were not?
Bjarke (Denmark)",2,2022,06,09
30,Good location for the price,Location is next to a hospital and easily accessible from the airport via taxi. There is a metro station (end of line/first stop) directly across the street and can take you to the city quickly. The price was right compared to other hotels and rooms were very nice and clean. Front desk seemed understaffed for Check in/check out process.,5,2022,06,08
30,Excellent,"Pre cruise overnight stay. Arrived late due to flight delay and was offered a room upgrade. The receptionist could not have been more helpful.

The hotel looks beautiful and modern and has that typical Hyatt look.
The lifts were rapid and on arrival the room was spacious, spotless and cool. The bathroom had two basins and a walk-in huge shower.

The bed was fantastically comfortable and sleep quality was excellent.

We had an excellent continental buffet before departure.

The only drawback, though not for us as it was halfway to the cruise terminal, is that it is not in a tourist hotspot or at the airport itself. The really good price reflected that.

One of the best pre cruise stays we have had.",5,2022,06,04
30,Great place to stay if you don't want to be in the central tourist district,Great place to stay if you don't want to be in the central tourist district.  End of the L1 line is located there so that you can get into town.  I had a terrific room on the 25th floor.  What more can I say?,5,2022,06,01
30,Excellent service-Beautiful and Spotless,"We arrived in Barcelona on one of the busiest weekends-  Formula 1 race was in town. All the hotels were packed and the city was ablaze with the excitement. Even though we had reserved our room well in advance, when we arrived (weary after our Mediterranean cruise) we were told that our teenage daughter could not stay in our 2 bed room. Apparently, the rule is that only two people can stay in a room. (If you have kids, take a closer look at Barcelona and the city rules. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs strictly a Hyatt thing). We were exhausted and irritable. There were absolutely no more rooms in the city. Hubby is a Hyatt world member with all his travels and had used points to secure our room. Upon discovering our predicament, Alberto (the manager) immediately went into action and took us personally up to the tower lounge where he saw that we had drinks, refreshments, and comfortable couches for lounging. Alberto worked his magic and was able to secure our family a suite with 2 rooms. The cleaning staff was efficient and got us into our space within an hour. I can‚Äôt tell you how grateful I am for Alberto‚Äôs  personal interest and honestly, he raised my opinions of Hyatt. We love Hyatt resorts and this hotel is of resort quality. Absolutely gorgeous. Spotless. And the service is what sealed it for us. Thank you, Alberto,  and Hyatt for saving the day for us!  
",5,2022,05,30
30,Spectacular,"Spectacular hotel with outstanding services. Amazing breakfast, superb food in the restaurant. We got a room on a very high floor with a superb view. On the top of that, you can access to a super gym with indoor pool, sauna, whirlpool, etc. My favorite place in Barcelona.",5,2022,05,28
30,A Room With a View,"Beautiful and elegant, the room just oozed relaxation. The club is a must with complimentary wine and beer and light snacks great place to stop in and work for a couple hours. The real winner though is the view from the tower, it is just stunning. Make sure to hit the atrium bar.",5,2022,05,26
30,Extra night after a cruise disembarking in Barcelona,"I am a travel advisor who works in the USA for a huge automobile association club.  Excellent hotel with great service, beautiful decor with floor to ceiling windows.  FANTASTIC walk-in shower with large rain shower head and side jets that can rival the best spas.  Be sure to include the buffet breakfast package.  It‚Äôs well worth the few extra bucks and it delicious with a lot of options to please any palate with customizations available for those with strict diets.  The hotel rate was quite fair and reasonable and the stay exceeded our expectations immensely.  Wonderful experience‚Ä¶we will definitely be back and I will be sure to recommend the Hyatt Regency Tower to others who will be traveling to Barcelona.",5,2022,05,24
30,Very disappointing for a Hyatt property,"I booked the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower for three nights prior to a cruise.  It was close to the airport and close to the port, and enormously cheaper than other hotels downtown.

I had requested an early arrival, but since the hotel was completely booked due to a Nokia conference, it was after 3 pm when I was finally able to check in.  However, upon departure, I was charged the extra 20 euros for early arrival.  After discussing actual check in time with the desk clerk, she did remove the charge.

The bedroom portion of the room has been renovated with a comfortable bed and a small refrigerator, which was appreciated.  However, the bathroom, somewhat renovated, still has black tile on the floor and on the walls of the shower, which makes it very dark.  The shower does not have a light.  I couldn't find a switch, so I asked the front desk, how to illuminate the shower.  Her answer was that the light from the toilet area was supposed to light the shower.  Take a look at my picture.  I used my battery powered travel light to light up the shower.  Don't like to take a shower in the dark.

This is a conference hotel.  If you are part of the group, with all your activities and meals provided by the Hyatt, I guess its ok.  But if you were here, like I was, on my own, it left much to be desired.  There are NO restaurants within walking distance.  Trust me, I walked the area for more than an hour.  Since I flew here from the USA, I was ready for dinner in the 5 pm - 6pm time frame.  After not finding any restaurants within walking distance, I decided to call for room service, but no one answered the phone, even though I tried several times.  Once again, down to the front desk, only to be told that dinner room service doesn't begin until 7:30 pm when the restaurants open.  Order at 7:30pm, delivered at 8:30 pm when my body was on east coast time was not an option.  Dinner was a Kind bar that I brought from home.

Also, there is not a bellman at the door, upon arrival or at departure.  I had some heavy luggage since I was going to be gone from home for three weeks, but there was no one there to help me.  The taxi dropped me off and it took me two times to get my things into the lobby.  Same thing upon departure, and no one helped me get a taxi.  I had to signal one to come to help me.

In summary, if you are here with a group you are probably ok.  If you are here by yourself and want to always eat in the hotel, no earlier than 7:30 pm, I guess you will be ok too.  But this hotel was not for me.  I will not be returning.",2,2022,05,16
30,Not a five star quality,"Elegenat hotel, well maintained, good service, and comfortable.

I expected more from Hyatt. Hotel with its reputation I felt it came short. The curtain in my room was broken and would not close, sunlight was waking me early every day. There was now shower door, the hinges are there but it seems the door was removed. And the room service food was below average. Did not enjoy any of the dishes. For example, a margarita pizza was overloaded with thick yellow cheese (not mozzarella) and the sauce had a sharp distinct, and unpleasant, seasoning.",3,2022,05,12
30,Most unbelieveable upgrade in my 78 years!,"I travelled for 36 years and been retired for 12 years and never have I had an upgrade as I did by Rodeigo. A full suite, living area, king bed, circulating bathtub! Unbelieveable. Rodeigo personally showed us to the room. Included access to Regency Club and free breakfast! Unbelieveable.",5,2022,05,11
30,Now I understand where the extra money goes,"We had a group of clients for a week at the hotel, everything was great, I just wish the location was closer to downtown.  The room was great, the food was great, it was a bit more pricey than what I am used to, but the clients loved it and it was clear to see where the extra money went. ",5,2022,05,09
30,Wonderful place to stay,This was my first time to the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower. It is a beautiful facility and wonderful staffs. The front desk assistant manager helped me checked in. He surly recognized my Hyatt member‚Äôs status. So grateful to be part of Hyatt family!  ,5,2022,05,08
30,Amazing Hotel !!,"Excellent Hyatt only 15  minutes from Barcelona city .
The room was spotless clean and comfortable with city view , huge tv, electric curtains , kettle and coffee, small fridge and the  shower was really good . The view at night really Amazing . The location works perfect for our visit,  it‚Äôs not at the city so is very quiet and there is always free parking at the area also food market and small restaurants too .
Lot of highways surrounding the Hotel that was excellent for our trip  to France returning at the same day .
People at the Front Desk were so helpful and friendly as all the staff . The lobby was very nice with beautiful areas . I highly recommended this Hyatt .",5,2022,05,08
30,Disappointing experience,"The decor of the hotel is very 1990‚Äôs. Black marble tiles, mirrors everywhere and poor lighting conspire to make it feel like you‚Äôre on a bad trip rather than walking around an allegedly luxury hotel. A closer look in the public areas and rooms reveals tired details once you‚Äôre past the flashy facade and over-bright lights, with filthy corners and fixtures not uncommon.

Nor are the designs of the rooms, public areas, walkways and elevators ergonomical.

For the rooms: The clothing storage areas are two open columns each side of a stack of drawers too narrow to be of use. The shower is designed to flood the immediate surroundings of the bathroom. The wooden wall furniture is intrusive, dated and pointless, the ironing facilities stingy and dilapidated, the desk too narrow and shallow to work on, and though a kettle is provided there are no tea and coffee making facilities. Most irritating and bizarre, though, is the decorative-only curtains that don‚Äôt close, so you can only close the see-through lace drapes and be treated to the sea of invasive street lights and traffic, woken by the sun whether you like it or not.

The conference area is quite small, and not able to host  conference of more than a couple of hundred people, and the space suffers from the same sense of environmental discomfort and anachronism as the rest of the hotel.

The restaurant has the marketing and prices of a high class eatery, and the portion sizes and presentation would have you believe you were somewhere that had their culinary skills dialled. Unfortunately you‚Äôre going to find that the prices and presentation don‚Äôt meet expectations and the food is, with a few exceptions that are not noteworthy, average at best. The selection of beer and wine is poor, and in one meal I experienced a half full bottle being taken from the table as they asked if I wanted another, and then the wrong drink being delivered. The staff were pleasant, but the experience was poor overall.

Should you be tempted to go into the local area, I‚Äôd advise you explore no further than the taxi rank to get a ride into a nicer part of town. Close to the hospital and airport the Hyatt may be, but the locale is depressing, run down and unpleasant, not the Barcelona you came to see (and there is a lot of charming, exciting and beautiful Barcelona to explore, it‚Äôs just not near this hotel.

Overall, one to avoid unless you really need to stay here, probably for work or the hospital, but don‚Äôt expect a pleasurable stay.",3,2022,05,03
30,Best Location & Vibes to experience BCN with a group,"Very good customer service and very good rooms.

Lifts however had a terrible sewage odour so hold your breath going up and down from reception.

The hotel spa was a 1-2 minute walk from the hotel however side doors being opened would have been more beneficial for us during the stay.",4,2022,05,03
30,Nice hotel with good breakfast.,"This was a nice hotel. It was clean. They had free breakfast with pancakes with maple syrup, scrambled eggs,bacon,sausages,croissants,doughnuts. The bed was nice with a sofa bed and 1 King Bed. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,03
30,Lovely and modern,"Visually a very modern and attractive hotel. The staff at the desk was very accommodating with taking care of our bags with our early arrival, and giving us pointers to get around from the hotel. The waitstaff was excellent at all three that we tried. We were fortunate enough to have the same staff member at two of the locations more than once. I feel terrible for forgetting his name, but not only was he great at his job, he was personable, and encouraged my shy use of Spanish. 

The rooms have great decor, and pretty fascinating views on all sides. Despite it being a little farther from the city center, would absolutely stay again!",5,2022,04,25
30,Reliable and friendly,"Nothing else to really say other than the folks were both reliable and friendly. Room was excellent for the price, was close to the city and airport. Served every single need we basically had and the food was way above par for a large hotel chain like Hyatt. You cant go wrong here for the price.",5,2022,04,23
30,Friendly staff /elegant rooms,"The staff were extremely friendly and  helpful . 
The rooms are spacious, clean and  elegant .
Good breakfast .
The lounge is big and has all the required amenities for business / chilling out as well. 
Easy access to the Metro

30,Superb stay and view!,"Simply fabulous stay!
We‚Äôve been few days in town with the family and we really enjoyed the hotel: the staff is super friendly and supportive, location is excellent and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and the view from the last floor is STUNNING!
As well the rooms are quite spacious and cleanliness is top quality.
Definitely if we‚Äôll come again to Barcelona we‚Äôll stay here",5,2022,03,28
30,TOP,It confirms same of opinion of my last stay. Great hotel and great service. Strongly recommended. Great service and installation. Nice restaurant on second floor and cool atmosphere in the bar. Strongly recommended,5,2022,03,27
30,"Nice hotel, friendly staff and good food, but also smelly bathroom","Stayed here for just one night for special family occasion. Had three rooms next to each other. While non-suites were fine, Regency suite was very rooms, nice, comfy bed, but also had nasty smell coming from the bathroom drainage, likely some long forgotten rotten hair. We could close both doors to the bathroom, so it did not bother us too much, but boy this was so preventable... big minus to the housekeeping. Otherwise very friendly staff, as Globalist received upgrade to Regency suite, greeted by the manager, and food quality excellent. Would definitely return, just hope that they fix the smelly bathroom!",4,2022,03,19
30,Barcelona Hyatt near Fira,"I usually stay at Hotel Sofia Barcelona, but I was curious to try this Hyatt hotel which was in close proximity to Fira.

Room size was a great, loft / split level - though taking a heavy suitcase up the narrow stairs can be a little challenging.  Quality of room was very average, there was a in room spa which overlooked outside - but it didn't feel clean. Reaching reception or room service via phone was challenging to get someone to answer.   Mobile Key & Chromecast exists in rooms which worked well. 

Fira is a 30 min walk away for those time you can't get a taxi, or prefer to get exercise.  Its important to note this hotel is a good distance away from Barcelona central, and there isn't many food options near by.

There was DJ running at the the bar downstairs which helped with atmosphere.   The VIP club on level 5 was great, spacious & clean; two conference rooms, drink and nibbles all day.",3,2022,03,07
30,Excellent Hotel! Great staff!,"Excellent Hotel! First of all, very kind staff, thank you Imen for your warm welcome and please someone tell to Begonia that I am very grateful not only for her great service at the breakfast but also for her tourism recommendations, we left the Valencia visit for another time, we went to Cadaques, as recommended by her, and it was the best choice ever! Thank you very much Begonia! In second place, our room was beautiful, amazing view, impeccable decoration and great amenities quality.
Best,
Ma. Pia Pacheco (Montevideo, Uruguay)",5,2022,02,15
30,One of my best experience with Hyatt,"The hotel really maintain cleanliness and Covid-19 protocol while they open club lounge and a few restaurants. Every staffs in the hotel was so friendly. Location is not super close to the city, but it is around 20-25 mins to downtown and metro station is only 5 mins away from the hotel.",5,2022,02,14
30,Great Hotel close to the airport,"I stayed here for 1 night as it was close to the airport.  I took a taxi which cost about 25 euros and was easy enough.  Check in was quick and the hotel was obviously modern and hip.  I was given a room on the 22nd floor - upgraded due to being a Hyatt Explorist. The room was lovely and big, with huge windows framing a great view of Barcelona. The bedroom had enough storage and chairs for me, and the bed was really comfortable.  There were plugs by the bed which was great.

The one thing I had an issue with was the bathroom - dont get me wrong it was very well appointed with a huge shower and separate toilet.  However the bathroom is done in black marble (I think) and I found it very very confusing to find anything - not only is it very masculine, but it was a nightmare to figure out where everything was.  I like the amenities though and the towels were big and fluffy.

As this was only a quick overnight, I didnt eat in the hotel but as I wandered round in the morning it look like a nice bright and airy bar and seating area next to reception.

I will definitely stay here again - a high end feeling hotel.",4,2022,02,13
30,Solid hotel experience.,"The hotel was very nice and the staff was friendly. The hotel was close to the airport, the parking was great, and I loved that the tv had a chromecast option. The bathroom was clean and large, they had great towels. ",5,2022,01,29
30,Great hotel in Barcelona,"I was heading on a business trip to Barcelona for one week. I have booked Hyatt Regency Tower hotel next to the airport.
I had a pleasant surprise to discover how beautiful the hotel design is. From the minute you walk in the lobby, till the moment you enter your room - everything is in good taste and very welcoming atmosphere. I love everyt moment and I highly recommend the hotel and the very friendly staff.  ",5,2022,01,23
30,Great stay in Barcelona,Awesome job by the Hyatt team to make our stay safe.  The food was excellent and service outstanding .  I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona and it‚Äôs proximity to the airport .  Thank you Hyatt ,5,2022,01,13
30,Exceptional Property,"This really is a fantastic hotel: stunning, modern decor - from the amazing lobby, to the rooms and views, all modern conveniences and luxurious accommodations and supplies, this is one hotel others should aspire to imitate.  On top of all that, the staff were very professional, bearing with our limited language abilities, assisting us with airlines, taxis, covid testing needed for travel, and treating us like family as we dealt with getting pickpocketed on the metro.  Truly a great experioence.",5,2022,01,12
30,Good Hotel with terrible housekeeping,"We like ending a long holiday with a predictable chain hotel and Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower was a straight choice first because its a Hyatt (our comfort hotel) and its proximity to the airport as we had a morning flight. Rooms were good and connecting as requested with comfortable beds. And that is where it ends.
We took out the cups to make tea and found one of them stained with coffee remnants at the bottom. We we told ourselves its a one-off issue and left it outside to be cleared during housekeeping the following day. The stained cup remained unmoved for the next 2 days.
We ordered room service after a tiring long drive and having experienced wonderful food in Spain for the last 2 weeks (including room service at other hotels), we expected at least decent food. Pasta and grilled fish - how wrong can one go. It was tasteless.
Next evening after having had dinner outside, we ordered 2 glasses of wine. Again Spanish wine in every nook and corner was wonderful but the 2 glasses that were brought to our room - the wine was oxidized and we had to throw it away. Yes it was 31 Dec and a busy night but no reason to serve wine that was left open for a long time to a guest.
Toiletries not replenished and past expiry date - this was perhaps the first time that we found toiletries not being replenished, 1 tiny bottle of lotion on day 1 and that was it. When we asked for shower gel/shampoo, we found product well past their expiry date on the shelf. 
Even basic hotel provide better housekeeping. And no, we did not call up and complain because we expected things to get better after day 1.",2,2022,01,10
30,Best service ever,"Hyatt Regency tower in Barcelona is, by far, one of the best Hyatt's. From the moment of my reservation,  Alberto Falsetta promptly responded to all my questions and requests.  The property is beautiful.  Service level, from all staff, was professional and helpful. The buffet breakfast, included, was outstanding.  They prepared perfect 3 minute eggs as well as a huge assortment of pastries,  etc. The hotel is located between the airport and downtown.  Not perfect to see Barcelona,  but we wondered around very close to the property and found a number of cafes, restaurants and grocery stores. Very safe area. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,01,05
30,Housekeeping  and F&B need to buck up for a good property & front desk,"What needs to improve - Not the usual Hyatt experience - tea cup had stains and not washed, missing water kettle (replaced after being called), wine was oxidised and stale with food tasting poor (specially with such awesome food in Spain). We decided not to eat at the hotel once we tasted the room service. 
Bathroom toileteries were expired (July 2021), no replacement of drinking water

Whats good - rooms are good & new, very good front desk and service. We requested and got connecting rooms.  Near the airport only 15mins drive.",2,2022,01,04
30,Amazing stay at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower,"I really enjoy my stay at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower. I got free upgraded to a suite room at the high floor with city view. I really like the double sink, spacious rest room and the walkin closet. The view in the daytime is spectacular that you could see the skylines of Barcelona. Plus, the fitness center, Metropolitan Gran V√≠a is right next to the hotel. It is one of the best fitness center that has 3 floor including swimming pool, spa, steam room and sauna. I will high recommend this hotel for all travelers.",5,2021,12,26
30,Best place to stay,By far the best one I have stayed in 2021.very clean very professional staff. The facilities like sports complex is close by swimming gym all included and breakfast I didn‚Äôt try it as I am not breakfast person but looked very nice. ,5,2021,12,23
30,Great Choice outside the hustle,"PROS:
Received upgraded suite [View of Barcelona]; champagne welcome; Welcome call checkup; US power (3-prong grounded) outlets; 2 large TV‚Äôs; Tower Lounge Open [breakfast/drinks/tapas]; Excellent Breakfast area and food; Jetted tub, separate rain shower, dressing room.
Location is convenient to/from the airport [~15-20 by bus].
CONS:
n/a
OBSERVATIONS:
There aren‚Äôt many external/area restaurants. The hotel does have a few [check on availability during COVID-restricted period].
The nearby subway takes only ~20 minutes [direct; no transfers] to reach city center [Pl. Catalunya].
",5,2021,12,15
30,A great stay at the Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower,A hotel convenient to the airport and a quick metro ride to the center of Barcelona.  The hotel is an older facility but looks to have received some very attractive upgrades when it became part of the Hyatt Regency brand.  ,5,2021,12,03
30,Excellent Stay,"Excellent hotel,  the breakfast buffet was very good with friendly staff. My wife and I choose this hotel before getting on our cruise.  The hotel is about 10 minutes from  cruise terminal and La 
Rambla.

The fitness facilities is located next door to the hotel. We had a wonderful time and the place is very clean and safe. ",5,2021,11,24
30,Not a tourist hotel,"This hotel is geared for conventions and corporate meetings and is not suitable for those wishing to visit Barcelona as tourists. It is outside the main centre and although there is a metro nearby we used taxis which were ‚Ç¨15 -20 each way to the main tourist attractions.
The hotel itself is the usual Hyatt standard, Covid restrictions however, meant that very limited dining was available and no business centre available to print boarding passes and location forms. The usual executive floors and facilities not available either. There did not appear to be good quality restaurants nearby and taxis to downtown seemed the only alternative.

The hotel does not have gym and pool facilities on site but a short walk outside to a health club is the alternative.

Staff very helpful but unless there is a conference at the hotel there were very few fellow guests..",3,2021,11,21
30,Not what I expected,"This hotel is about a 25 euro ride from the airport and about 30 euros to the cruise port and anywhere from 16-35 Euros around then it is located on the out skirts of town. The beds are uncomfortable, outside not appealing at all, the inside looks ok but could be better, only one person on the staff was helpful and pleasant to work with. Overall, if you are looking for the Hyatt Experience not at this location. The food well go elsewhere.",1,2021,11,06
30,Fantastic Short Stay,We were only in Barcelona for  1 night but when our flight got cancelled we wanted to upgrade and move a little closer to the airport and the Hyatt didn't disappoint!  The staff was so friendly and accommodating!  We ate dinner in the one open restaurant and it was very good as well.  The room was clean and well appointed and the views were great.,5,2021,11,03
30,Enjoyable stay with great location and service.,"Newly renovated and fresh.  nice area with easy access to all transport.  Superb food and service. 
Noticeable that All the staff are helpful and friendly.  
The breakfast is uniquely pleasant and enjoyable with energetic staff and nice views of the area.",5,2021,10,25
30,good option,"Even if the location does not really offer much walking around options, i think this is a great option to consider as the hotel is high end, service very friendly and access to metropolitan gym that is amazing.",4,2021,10,20
30,We had the place to ourselves!,"This palace opened two weeks prior to our stay after being closed for a year.  We stayed in a two story apartment on the 25th floor.  As expected, it was spotless and very comfortable.  There was a perfectly working jacuzzi tub overlooking the city (mostly airport).  If you can, I recommend a stay as soon as possible.  While you probably won't have room service (covided) there are operating restaurants in the hotel, one formal and one casual, serving very good food. Service was amazing. Note: the pictures of the two story suite do *not* do it justice!",5,2021,09,26
30,Beautiful hotel!,I stayed here a few weeks ago and was very impressed with the beauty of the hotel and the eagerness of the staff to help. There was a hiccup or two with housekeeping but the hotel itself and the WONDERFUL THREE STORY gym and spa with steam room and sauna and etc  available to guests takes it over the top and makes it a great stay for business or pleasure!,4,2021,09,24
30,Absolutely amazing,"This was one of the best hotels we stayed in during our trip. We upgraded to the high room and it was totally worth it. The rooms were incredibly nice, the bathroom/shower, the checkin was awesome, the services (spa, pool, lounge, etc.) all top notch. If you are staying in Barcelona the only con is you are a little far from the city to do touristy stuff but if you don't mind that the comfort from this hotel is totally worth it.",5,2021,09,24
30,Hyatt barcelona really pleasant,"We had a nice free upgrade to a room with great view. Nice spacious room, clean. Garage under the building is perfect. Personal was nice and friendly always ready to assist. Good location to explore barcelona.",4,2021,09,16
30,"Clean, Comfortable Hotel with great customer service.","The title says it all, the hotel was clean and they take the covid-19 precautions serious.  The room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. There are nice views and you are close to a metro so if you are looking for something in this area I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2021,09,05
30,"Bad check in, good stay","Bad check in experience, Staff attempted to improve the situation, but no excuse for having 2 staff members who can together only handle 1 customer at a time. The treatment after that was good, but I just want a speedy check in, not amenities when adequate 5-Star service is not provided. Room nice, club nice, personalized attention for remainder of stay. Location not exactly convenient for airport, next to a hospital outside Barcelona. Need a car, transportation possible but not the most convenient. Signage not updated, causing taxi confusion (Hesperia Hotel, not Hyatt Reg.)",4,2020,03,06
30,Great new Hyatt property in Barcelona!,"Great stay at Hyatt Regency after frustration with a cancelled flight!!!. Many thanks to Jaimo at the front desk & Carla in guest relations, they went above & beyond to relieve our stress. We felt right at home with their hospitality & recommendation for dinner. Thank you Hyatt Regency Barcelona!",5,2020,02,18
30,Excellant Hotel,I was extremely sattisfied with the hotel the location was perfect for the job that i had to do in Barcelona and would definately look at staying there on a weekend city break with my partner.The only thing i would like to see is the downstairs bar area made a little more cosy and not so wide open to the rest of the area.,5,2020,02,17
30,Definately NOT 5 star,"We stayed here overnight en route to Asia and the experience was terrible.  We were allocated a south facing room on floor 11.  The room got progressively hotter despite the A/C and when it reached 30 degrees I contacted the operator who mid way through me explaining my problem screamed at me incoherently and put the phone down.  I went to reception and was told there was no A/C in the hotel that day  Why allocate a south facing room when you knew it was going to get very hot, and why was this not explained to us at check in?  We then decamped to a room on the shady side on 23rd floor.  This room in a 5 star Business Hotel had no WiFi in it and the shower when used flooded the toilet area.  This was not a 5 star experience and was well below a 1 star, but at 5 star prices.  On the positive side, some staff there were very pleasant and helpful, but not all. I contacted the hotel after we left to complain but no one bothered to reply.  Avoid this hotel at all costs is my advice.",1,2020,02,04
30,Friendly Staff alongside a spacious room!,The Hesperia Barcelona Tower was a wonderful experience. Dana and Sarah were exceptional. My husband and I celebrated our 10th Wedding Anniversary and were treated to a lovely chocolate dessert. I must commend the staff for their English and the room was both spacious and modern. I would return again. ,5,2020,01,13
30,Great experience,"This amazing hotel is one of my favourites in Barcelona,is near to airport and stright entry to Barcelona center.
The view are incredible from top Tower, amazing rooms and excelent service room, if you want relax is a good option.",5,2020,01,13
30,New years eve,"I stayed here a few years ago and stayed again , the rooms and views are beautifull, check in was sweet and simple and overall I would recommend it to all , i also advise the Barcelona city view of the room as is really nice to wake up to.
",5,2020,01,06
30,Below average service quality,"Let down by the new year party at the hotel. No hosting skills whatsoever and a dry and drab party - there was no one to guide us and the party had poor organisation in terms of activities. Several staff members cant communicate well in English. 

The hotel is not in a safe neighbourhood, our valuables were stolen. ",2,2020,01,02
30,Swanky Business Hotel üëçüèª,"Well located close to the airport it‚Äôs easy to understand why this is a popular conference location.

Arriving late I was pleased that check in was quick and efficient, the pre-paid room making the process easy.

On arriving at my suite I was impressed by the finish and size, a large reception incorporating the ‚Äòbathroom‚Äô leads to an even larger room. In the room you‚Äôll be wanting for very little, very important for us Brits you‚Äôll also have tea on hand. Comfortable bed and nice bedding as you‚Äôd expect in a 5 star establishment.

The tower view is ‚Äòlong‚Äô but don‚Äôt expect to see the best of Barcelona from any floor... you‚Äôll have seen motorways before and they‚Äôre not pretty in any location.

The breakfast is excellent, a huge choice of hot and continental foods. Hot drinks a served at your table despite the machines being accessible, it‚Äôs not ever so clear when you first arrive what the protocol is there! The freshly squeezed orange juice is spot on. Hot food is OK, not very hot either morning I ate it so skipped it on the third night as the cold offerings were far superior and fresh.

Bar service on a bit so busy conference evening was slow and not particularly welcoming.

Fitness facilities as mentioned in previous reviews are offered in the adjacent Health Club, a bit disappointing that a 5 star hotel doesn‚Äôt have inclusive facilities but the club next door is more than you could want or need for a short stay even if it does dent your pocket to the tune of ‚Ç¨25!

Check out a bit steady, specifically due to the hotel being very near capacity due to the conference attendees, again a bit of an own goal in a 5 star hotel to be fair. Taxi booking also a bit hit and miss, I had to ask twice to confirm a return taxi due to the first request not being done.

Restaurants good and I‚Äôve covered in a separate review, really good staff, great food, reasonably priced for the type of environment and quality.

A good stay.",4,2019,12,08
30,Interesting Duplex Suite - Modern property - Best staff,"As a Hyatt Elite, stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and really a great property.
We stayed in two duplex suites and that is one of the main reasons we chose this hotel as we never had a duplex hotel despite stying in many huge suites.
The living room is downstairs with a half bath and the bedroom is upstairs.
Only complaint with this set up is the hassle to take large bags up the stairs. We left bags downstairs.
There is also Jacuzzi tub right next to the bed with large open windows. The city views are very nice.
Rain shower and body jets in the shower.

The staff is amazing. Everyone goes to extreme to help. The check in was friendly and excited to see us in the idle of the night. 
The club lounge host helped with tickets without even asking.
When asked for metro directions, he walked with us until the station which is just a block away to show the place.
Breakfast is very nice array and good set up and again same friendly staff everywhere.
The location is closer to airport and need to take metro or taxi to city attractions. Nothing around this place.
The club lounge is spacious and very empty. Went there only once during evening but not many eating options there but definitely a place for drinks and few day time snacks if you stay on property.
The lobby is chick and I liked the giant screen and the glass floor.

If not staying within the city at walkable distance in any other property, this is definitely a great place to stay at much less cost.
The hotel and suites have contemporary design.",5,2019,12,08
30,Lovely people but the hotel could do with some renovation,"Really nice people work here. They will go out of there way to help you and are away smiling. 
Breakfast is good and the service at breakfast also. Again service with a smile.

Downside: the windows could do with a clean and as it rained, it seemed to leak in all over the place so there were towels and buckets out. 

The rooms are not as clean as I would have expected from a five star, and the shower from the room above was leaking in to my bathroom.

Shame really as the service was outstanding!",4,2019,12,06
30,"Great hotel, great people!","My family just returned from a relaxing week-long stay at Hesperia Tower in Barcelona. It was an unforgettable experience, the whole family loved it!  The wife and kids tell me the hotel is the best part of the trip, and I agree. I could not think of a better base for our vacation.

I highly recommend booking a suite or/and adding Tower Club access to your reservation. The service in Tower Club is awesome. You get very nice refreshments, food, and snacks anytime from 7am to 10pm worry-free. This flexibility is great for families who may have varying schedules every day. The hotel has easy access to airport and easy taxi ride to all the best attractions anywhere in the city

The friendly staff make you feel at home, all of whom were very professional and helpful. A special call-out to Carla who helped us with enthusiasm and a great smile, whether it is providing our food or travel advice. She was always friendly and patient, and went the extra mile to let us feel very comfortable and know that we have a friend in Barcelona. This caring touch is very special and highly appreciated.

This hotel is currently Hesperia Tower, but will be re-branded as a Hyatt Regency in 2020. I expect great things to continue from this hotel and staff, cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2019,12,03
30,"An upscale business hotel in a unique, architectural, gem","If you‚Äôre a fan of modern global architecture this hotel is worth staying in just for that. However, it‚Äôs also a very comfortable, world-class, business hotel with excellent restaurants, superior service and large modern rooms. 

I experienced none of the issues that other reviews describe - kettle, yes; complimentary tea and coffee, yes (in the desk drawer); comfortable bed, double yes; luxury toiletries, yes; in-room safe, yes; aircon/heating, yes; metro access to the rest of the city, absolutely. 

Soon to be under the Hyatt brand, this is a great place to stay if you need to be close to the airport for an early departure or late arrival. No shuttle but car hailing apps make the journey affordable, quick and easy. Recommended. ",5,2019,11,19
30,Great hotel with great staff,"Close to airport and 15 eur / 10 min to downtown.
Very friendly and helpful staff.
Great lunch and great breakfast.
Nice room with beautiful view.
Moderate prices.
Reception bar closes a little early and the tower bar is more a club.
",5,2019,11,18
30,Bring money with you to pay for extras,The hotel has no gym (it is not clear in the hotel website that entry to a gym next door is EUR 12). Bring extra money with you to cover for all the extras - we asked for more tea bags in our room after the second night and were told they would be charged to our room (even 1 star hotels give free tea bags in the room). Disappointing and expected more from Hyatt. I told the reception of these issues on checkout and the lady smiled at me. The hotel buildings and rooms are fine though... but the hotel fails in other areas.,2,2019,11,18
30,Long weekend,Very clean hotel - nice and modern. Staff seemed really friendly. Really nice peaceful places to sit and relax plus you can go up to the sky top bar with unbelievable views of the city at night and relax with some music and drinks.,4,2019,11,17
30,Amazing hotel and service,"The Barcelona Tower Hesperia more then surprised me with its incredible property and staff.  The suite I had was large and comfortable.  Great bed, shower, bathroom, tub and pillows.   Roger in the Tower Club was simply amazing.   He took care of anything you needed.  Greeted you by name and was always there to give suggestions on where to go in this beautiful city.  Irene in the restaurant was a great server who also remembers your name.  

Great hotel and a Metro station across the street to get you downtown to explore this vibrant city

I highly suggest the Hesperia Barcelona Tower",5,2019,11,13
30,A good option,"Cozy hotel near a subway station with good breakfast and attentive staff. I asked about a gym, they said at the front desk that the hotel has no gym and no swimming pool for guests, if you want to use, you need to pay 12 EUR to use a nearby gym. By the standard of the hotel, of a good category, I see it as a must, or a free partnership for guests.",4,2019,11,05
30,Nice spot for a conference,"The organisation of the conference I attended, had to switch on short notice from Vienna to Barcelona. Hesperia was a good choice, halfway between city and airport. Check-in was swift and friendly. By chance I got an upgrade to a suite... Extremely nice...",4,2019,11,05
30,Lovely evening meal,"Staff - all staff I came into contact with were very helpful and friendly.

Room - nice, stylish, spacious room.  Great shower.  Comfy bed.  Great view. A few complaints - Its a 5 star hotel with 5 star price - surely a free bottle of water in the fridge - rather than ‚Ç¨4 for a fairly small bottle would be a nice touch.  No iron or ironning board in the room.  Not enough hangers.

Hotel - its an impressive building.  Stylish. Great views.  Some people seemed to find the lifts confusing - the system is just a little different.

Bar - pricey - but not unexpected.

Food - breakfast is good.  Evening meal in the 2nd floor restaurant is outstanding.  Excellent service.  Interesting menu.  Delicious food.",5,2019,11,04
30,Excellent Hospitality,It was an excellent experience to stay here. Excellent rooms and bathrooms. Neat and clean environment. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Good restaurant and bar. Accessibility little uneasy as location is slightly away from main city center and can not be managed go around on foot. Recommended for all ages.,5,2019,10,30
30,Not disappointed ,"This was my first stay here after many years staying at other Barcelona hotels and I was not disappointed. The staff were great, the rooms lovely, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was the only meal I had and again it did not disappoint for quality and selection.",5,2019,10,14
30,Nice hotel but rooms lack some basic amenities ,"Lovely building and rooms with modern styling, very helpful and friendly front desk staff. 
Unfortunately the rooms lacked some of the basic amenities one would expect in a 5 star hotel. 
No complementary bottled water, no tea/coffee making facilities, no tissues, no iron etc etc
The bed was very comfortable though and the WiFi was very good. 
It‚Äôs a real shame this hotel is let down by this.",3,2019,10,08
30,Wonderful won‚Äôt be disappointed ,"What wonderful airport hotel perfect end to a great trip ,the interiors are very impressive and interesting.

The plight staff and overall perfect service will relax you before the flight home .

Edwin the head waiter in the Bouquet restaurant was just super made our evening with his theatrical service from Olive oil tastings to his knowledge of wines ..

It was my birthday and my wife had pre ordered a birthday desert the week before and they didn‚Äôt let us down with a wonderful ice cream cake and a chorus of happy Birthday .. 

Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend and stay here again . ",4,2019,09,24
30,Great weekend rates,"Convenient location. 200m away from the metro. Recently rebranded to Hyatt regency. And as a World of Hyatt globalist member, got all benefits.  Room upgrades, free breakfast at the cafe and lounge access.",5,2019,09,17
30,Affordable Luxury in Barcelona.,"I was very well impressed with the comfort, luxury, views and ambience of this tower hotel in two separate stays I had . Location was nice but a little outside the heart of the city, being 20/25 minutes away from The Plaza de Espa√±a and Plaza Catalunya taking on metro  (Line 1)
As an explorist member I was upgraded to a nice and comfortable room on the 23rd floor.
Views were amazing.
Club Lounge served snacks and drinks all day and did not disappoint.
I enjoyed every minute of my stay!",5,2019,09,11
30,Good stay,"The hotel is close to the airport and about 12 minutes away from the heart of Barcelona but nothing special is within walking distance. The rooms are beautiful with modern decor and has beautiful views. However, the lobby area including furnitures appeared dirty and dusty. The staffs I encountered at the front desk were friendly and helpful at that moment but it ended there. I requested an iron and had to call the front desk four times. It took more thank an hour to receive it. I was having a bit of trouble closing the blinds so called for assistance. The gentleman at the front desk said he‚Äôd send someone, no one came and I was too exhausted to keep calling. Eventually I figured it out. 

The elevator is a whole other complication and the most annoying thing is the fact that the hotel advertise a free airport shuttle that doesn‚Äôt exist. ",4,2019,08,30
30,Could and should be so much better,"We chose this as an overnight hotel for its position close to the airport for an early flight. It certainly is quite close, as our 21st floor room had a great view of it which we appreciated. The taxi was affordable, but why did we have to pay when the hotel's own blurb is still saying there's a free shuttle? There isn't! Having to pay ‚Ç¨12 for a day in a spa when all you want is half an hour in the pool is a bit steep, too. Most hotels I stay in include that in the room price. We didn't use any of the facilities in the end as they're all overpriced.

I had asked for an early check-in, not unreasonable as we were leaving at 7 a.m. next day, IMO. Our taxi from the cruise port dropped us there mid-morning. They were sorry but no rooms were available yet. Okay, we left the cases and went out to explore. We crossed the park and found La Flama, a nice place for a drink and then lunch. Then we had another drink just across the open space from the hotel. On our return, there still wasn't a room free. What on earth were housekeeping doing all morning? At 3 p.m. we finally got our room. Maybe that superb view was to compensate.

The lifts are bizarre. What on earth is wrong with a simple arrow to press? I don't want a screen full of words. How multi-cultural is that? On our way down once, the lift stopped; it seemed a little high (there's a window to the outside) but the hotel is on a slight rise and the counter above the door clearly showed zero so we got out as two people got in. Quite where we were I'll never know, but it certainly wasn't the ground floor.

Our room was okay and it had a kettle (that's all - bring everything you'll need), gowns, safe, etc., but no tissues. The design of the bathroom was bizarre - black shiny tiling and mirrors everywhere meant there was constant danger of crashing into walls. The loo door seemed to double as one of the wardrobe doors although it didn't fit either space properly (and you can forget about locking it - no lock!). I was interested to read a review just now about the AC going off during the night. We awoke around 5 a.m. to find ourselves in a pool of perspiration.

Staff were all friendly and helpful although somewhat disorganised. I suspect their employers are far more disorganised. We were really not impressed. I've seen it described as a 5*. I think the fact that we paid just ‚Ç¨90 shows that even they know that's a misleading statement.",3,2019,08,25
30,I was robbed here,"I was robbed in this hotel, and had such a horrible experience here that I'd give it 0 stars if I could. I stayed at this hotel for a business trip, and had kept all my money stored in my suitcase, locked in my room. Not only was my money stolen, no help was provided by the hotel to recover it. The hotel staff washed their hands off the entire incident and refused to take any responsibility, let alone help me find the culprit. They don't have any security cameras, so they refuse to acknowledge any theft and put the blame on the customer. I still haven't recovered my money, which was a huge amount. The hotel takes no responsibility of the safety of your luggage in their locked rooms which can be accessed only by their staff. I would not recommend anyone to ever stay here. You and your belongings are not at all safe here. Don't ever ever go to this hotel. Be safe.",1,2019,08,11
30,Greglan,"One of the best stay we had in Barcelona, staff was great always smiling, rooms were great nice view from the room, Mariel suggested us places to visit. 
It was one of the best experience we had in Barcelona.üëç",5,2019,08,06
30,Great stay at the Hesperia Barcelona Tower hotel.   Very attentive personnel.,"Great hotel, excellent amenities, conveniently located near the BCN airport. 
Special thanks to Nacho at the front desk for being so attentive and polite. Great attention to details, made us feel welcome.",5,2019,07,19
30,Nothing 5 star about this Hotel,"This is a conference hotel / business hotel, it does very little for people who wish to be tourists in the city. So I write this review as a tourist and cannot judge the conference facilities etc. First its location and the end of L1 metro - if you ask at reception where the metro station is they say 'across the road' , well frankly i and many other people needed a bit more information - go out of the hotel turn right across the road heading towards the hospital then bear left you will see a red metro sign over a staircase - this is the metro. (Which is fantastic by the way), metro will take you to all the tourist spots you might have to change lines and will be around 20 - 30 mins. One of my BIGGEST things about this hotel given its grading is that you have no tea / coffee making facilities in your room, it will cost you around ‚Ç¨3.50 for coffee in reception area. No balconies or opening windows in any rooms. No facility to set an alarm as you dont have a clock. Swimming pool will cost you around ‚Ç¨12. if you are a smoker (like me) then standing room only at the front of the hotel - no benches or other others though they do provide 4 ashtrays. TV channels in English only 2 both news channels - not that i go anywhere to watch TV but did find myself wanting to watch a film to kill a couple of hours - no chance here not even pay to view. They do put a card in the room to tell you about the electric curtains but nothing about internet log in - get this from reception area where there are signs. At 9.30pm the place is dead, any live musician will have packed up and frankly i found myself quite alone with 4 staff members at 9.40pm. The room windows are large but the sofa faces towards the room rather than the view perhaps thats because in most rooms you only see the motorway. Good points air con in the room was good, it was clean and for a 5* the bottles of wine start at ‚Ç¨18. Had a dinner which you feel like you are eating in the reception area - steak, when it arrived well it was a nice steak with some onions / tomatoes NO vegetables or potatoes etc - i did ask the waiter were the vegetables were and he told me they were under the steak ! . On the room service menu in the room it states 'The great advantage of a hotel is that its a refuge from home life' - well frankly at home if i want a cup of coffee i go and make it - here you either have room service or go down to the reception area. So thats my review as a tourist not as someone going to a conference and by the way i used to organise conferences. So as a potential tourist again heading to Barcelona would i choose this hotel - no way.",2,2019,07,15
30,Great stay in Barcelona,"Stayed in this hotel as part of a guided group tour through Spain. This is a great hotel, with great service and spacious rooms (see pics). The rooms have top to bottom glass windows with electronic curtains. The breakfast buffet is amazing and the service second to none. The hotel is walking distance to the metro station and also a quick drive to the Barcelona airport. We had dinner at the onsite restaurant/bar on the evening before our early flight out of Barcelona and the food was good. Would stay here again.",5,2019,06,29
30,Tracelink conference ,"Lovely hotel really close to the airport, only a 10 minute drive. The staff were friendly and always available to help. The rooms were a great size, very comfortable and well equipped with good size tv‚Äôs and plenty of space to hang cloths.The food we had was all of a high standard. ",4,2019,06,15
30,"Whoppaaaa, excellent stay with 5*****","Thank you very much for the great time we had in Barcelona.
Very friendly & helpful staff. Thank you to all receptionists and breakfast staff.
You welcomed us extremely heartful and we enjoyed the time!
My wife, daughter Selina (1year) and I felt very comfortable during our stay.
Room was quiet, clean and you have enough space. >> wonderful view over Barcelona (you can see MontJuic, SagradaFamilia, Tibidabo,..)
Bathroom is very stylish with a lot of mirrors.
Breakfast was great, you are able to eat until you... everything is soooo tasty.
CityCenter is reachable with Metro direct line (L1) within 20min, Airport is just 10min by Taxi (~25EUR), very easy and comfortable.
We had a really nice stay at your property and cannot wait to come back again.
Our ""little chica"" Selina will perhaps stay in some of your minds, too. ""Whooppaaa"" to Mercedes :)",5,2019,06,06
30,One night before our flight out of Barcelona airports,"Room  great with huge windows looking to the land marks  of Barcelona 
High light of stay was dinner at the bouquet restaurant and EDWIN the restaurant manager. 
He is very passionate about the food and especially the wines of the Area and if Spain. Most enjoyable evening ! We had an olive oil tasting with him too and drank the wines he recommended. He is reall asset to the Hotel and Bouquet restaurant 
We will stay here again if need a room before a flight out of Barcelona airport",5,2019,06,05
30,Nice little city break! ,"Booked Hesperia as we were coming to Barcelona for a concert. 
Upon arrival first impressions were that it was a little out of the way. However we soon learnt that there was a metro just across from the hotel! The metro is so efficient and can pretty much get you anywhere you wish to go!! Now it doesn‚Äôt matter that the hotel is a little out of the way because access to everywhere else is really easy!! 

The hotel lobby was very nice and modern and we had a very nice warm welcome from the reception staff. Our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready so we sat in the lobby and had a drink. The staff were very accommodating. 

Once we managed to get up to our room I was very happy. We had 1203, very clean and comfortable with views straight out over the roads. Still a good view though so glad we had a floor higher up. 

My only slight niggle would be that when you look up Hesperia to book it, their write up states they have a pool. Actually the pool doesn‚Äôt belong to them it‚Äôs the health club round the corner so if you haven‚Äôt paid for a premium room then you have to pay ‚Ç¨12 a day to visit. The health club facilities are pretty impressive I have to say but I think ‚Ç¨12 is a little
Excessive when you have already paid to stay in the hotel. 

Would happily stay here again and would also recommend to others. ",5,2019,06,03
30,Lacking details,"I stayed in Hesperia Tower for business trip. 

Overall my stay was ok, but there were some quite important details missing: 
- When called the hotel to help with taxi pick up from the office, reception confirmed to send one, but i never got one. In case they dont provide this service - they could have stated it clearly instead of making the customer waist the time
- The room is lacking basics for 5* hotel: no water in the room, no tooth brush/comb etc. 
- Knowing the most of customers are business travelers, breakfast starting only from 7am is just too late

For my next business trip i will opt for another hotel. ",3,2019,05,24
30,Mini Break to Barca,"Perfect location for a few days in Barcelona, friendly helpful staff, clean rooms and good value. Would recommend. This hotel is located within 50 metres of St Joseph‚Äôs Market, if you like seafood you have to visit.",4,2019,05,05
30,"Great overall, easily accessible","I arrived before 3pm checkin speaking to the lovely lady (sorry forgot her name) at reception she check if our room was ready & fortunately it was so allowed us in early. I was then greeted by the assistant manager (male who's name I have also forgot) confirming some queries I had emailed ahead regarding.

I stayed in Room 2508 - Duplex suite on the 25th floor. Lovely room with good views. The room has 2 toilet's, tv's & air con units(1 on each floor), walk in shower with 3 settings(hand held, jets & rainfall) & jacuzzi bath beside the bed. 

My stay included breakfast which was buffet style - Lots of options of juices, fruits, eggs, breads, pastry, yoghurts ect..  Great hospitality with staff making you hot drinks while you devour your food.

I was given access to the Tower Club which was a lounge to relax with complimentary drinks & snacks. Large area with dining area, sofas, tv, cd player & telephone.

Spa access was also included with my stay the gym was in a public building behind the hotel. Great range of gym equipment, tennis court & swimming pools. Clean with friendly staff.

We dined in the hotel twice out of our 4 days. The Bouquet restaurant was really nice with an gentle ambience. A staff member called Edwin went above & beyond to ensure are experience was marvellous getting the chefs to mix & match options on the menu to our liking aswel as going out of his way to make us a Sangria which was not even on the menu. I managed to access the Evo restaurant on the roof which was pretty cool ufo shaped, great views. Did not taste the food but had some drinks up there. Lovely gent although he did not know much english he still managed to show me around which was nice.

A gent called Hector in the lobby was extremely helpful with advise, directions & arranging transport. There was also serval ladies that was as great who's names I forgot to take down, sorry.

We had a late flight which was not so convenient had we had to check out at the usual time in the morning but Roger kindly arranged a 5pm checkout at no extra cost which was super.

Windows could have done with a clean but was understandable having that the hotel is almost entirely glass & the height .
On the first 2 days there seemed to be a weird drainage smell in parts of the building which seemed to have disappeared on the 3rd & 4th day of my stay.
I arrived on the Easter Sunday, most places are closed for bank holidays so did not get to do/see much on the Sunday & Monday.

Overall the hotel is great although it is not city centre it was close to the airport & easy to commute to/from. Nice to not be in the busiest parts of town but close enough to enjoy it. Metro(tube) line literally across the road less than 5min walk. 20min to Catalunya(Barca version of Westend). 30min to Liceu (museums, Cathedral & massive food market). 40 min to Barceloneta (Beach area).  You can purchase a 'T10' metro ticket which covers you for 10 trips, can be used by two+ people with the one ticket & can be used over multiple days this cost me ‚Ç¨10.20. The metro is easy to navigate on just pick yourself up a map.

Thank you! I would certainly stay again",4,2019,04,27
30,Fantastic hotel ,"Lovely hotel in a quiet neighbourhood on the edge of Barcelona. 10 minutes from the airport.
Beautiful rooms. Wonderful helpful, knowledgable staff. 
Just 500 yards from the Metro station (20 minutes to the centre of Barcelona). Metro runs from 5am to midnight so getting around is easy.
There‚Äôs also a little corner shop nearby where you can purchase the essentials.",5,2019,02,22
30,One if the best hotels I've stayed in,"A little off the beaten path, however, well worth it. Everything you need us right there at your finger tips. Hesperia Barcelona is luxurious. I wish I could find the grape scented bath soak they had for their guests here in the states. ",5,2019,02,12
30,Great hotel with great facilities,"Stayed in this hotel many times.
Formed of Hesperia Tower, a hotel with Olympic sized swimming pool, conference rooms, stunning rooms with great views of the city. The Executive lounge is spacious and comfortable with a large selection of refreshments.

The other part is the Fira Suites which are also modern in design and very comfortable. The suites are spacious, with Nespresso machines and a well equipped kitchenette. On the downside, in the summer, the smell if horrible from the lake next to the suite and the hotel is located next to a large housing estate.

Breakfast is expensive in the hotel but with a large selection. A 3 minute walk and the local cafe is also full of fresh bakery options.

Avoid taxis waiting outside the airport as the hotel provides it's own complimentary shuttle to the airport and town centre.",4,2019,02,12
30,Too pricey for nothing ,Was there for a convention and ended up staying there. The place was extremely average and very pricey. Admittedly the room was nice but there was nothing special about it. The biggest bummer was the location of this hotel required taxi transport to get anywhere. So not a great option in my opinion ,3,2019,02,11
30,Amazing,Everything was wonderful!!thank you for the nice staying . 5stars service and amazing view! .maybe the area is too isolated at night but the subway station is close.thank you for everything and see you next time ,5,2019,02,10
30,Restaurant,"We only came to the restaurant, not the hotel.
I really loved the restaurant, it was really good. And Luca was really kind with my and my husband and his cocktails really good. We will come again for sure!",4,2019,02,08
30,"Overall a nice place to stay near Airport, expected litte more","It is a nice property near Airport and rooms are decent. So if you have any events to attend in nearby area, then you can choose to stay here. If you are visiting Barcelona for a family visit or vacation, then I will not recommend this place. It is a Business hotel.

Food was Ok and I didn't have any problem at all during my stay. Just expected little more as it claimed to be a 5-star",4,2019,02,04
30,Quirky but nice!!!,"This hotel is a strange one, 5 star and ideal for the airport. The name refers to the restaurant where on the up of the hotel which to be honest scared me..... too high to be comfortable for me and was under refurbishment when I visited. That said Roma are well appointed, clean and modern and the bathroom also very clean and again well appointed. Great shower!! Lifts are a faff here with an electronic ordering system which when busy just doesn‚Äôt work and two are glass backed.... again a bit scary for me! Food was excellent and the staff are all very friendly and polite. Great stay here and would stay again.... great spa facility next door too but this is charged @ ‚Ç¨12.00 per session but well worth the money. All in all a great stay..... 20 mins cab to centre ‚Ç¨12/15 in an Uber and ‚Ç¨20 in a taxi! ",4,2019,01,25
30,Amazing,"Spent our anniversary here and it was amazing. 

We had the suite with lovely views from the top. We had a bath/ Jacuzzi right next to our bed and a separate shower. The service was excellent and the staff are all helpful and friendly. The breakfast was a buffet and they had a wide selection, well worth it. 

I would highly recommend.",5,2019,01,17
30,Lovely place for cocktails and tapas,"Very modern and nice interior, specially a lobby part. Went there for drinks cause some friends were staying in the hotel. We had some tapas and cocktails and everything was just amazing! Really nice service, Karina took really good care of us. Surly we will be back soon for more drinks! Thank you!",5,2019,01,06
30,30th birthday celebration,"This hotel is nice.  It‚Äôs comfortable and some staff are lovely but it‚Äôs not really a five star hotel... i would say a 3 star possibly 4 star at a stretch.  We were fortunate being upgraded to a suite which we were grateful for, however there were other things that we just annoying.  Mainly the swimming pool and spa does not allow children.. So when you book there is nothing on any website about no kids allowed in the swimming pool, this to me is crazy for a five star hotel... not exactly a family friendly hotel.   

Tried arranging flowers and chocolates for my wife to be in the room when we arrived via emails and tried to book a table for christmas lunch on the 25th December... no one gets back to you... sent over seven emails about this and eventually had to call from the UK and get angry on the phone before eventually getting some responses.

Shame as the hotel has great potential.

Them denying my three year old son a swim ruined our trip. ",3,2019,01,03
30,Good place for business lunch and cocktails ,"We went there for a business meeting. The hotel environment is very nice, light and modern. Had a great lunch in the lobby bar. Our waitress Karina was really helpful and nice. We also had some amazing cocktails after. Can‚Äôt say anything about other parts but bar axis very recommended!",5,2018,12,27
30,Amenities need improvement ,"The hotel is close subway station and airport. It's a nice place to stay but there are a few aspects that need improvement. First and foremost, there's no kettle in the room and when I requested for one, I was told to get hot water from house keeping whenever I need it. This is soooo inconvenient. There's also a need for TV guides in the room as most programs are in Spanish.
The bar fridge is not cold at all and thys almost useless.
The thing l like most of the room is the shower cubicle as the pressure is good and the temperature is stable and easy to control. ",4,2018,11,27
30,Nice hotel for business,"Stayed 4 nights for a conference.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  Convenient shuttle from the airport.  The breakfast buffet is probably the nicest I've had at a hotel.  Rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable - only miss having a coffee maker the room. While the hotel is across the street from a metro station that is about 30 minutes into the heart of town, there's not much in the vicinity of the hotel itself and I probably would not stay if leisure was the sole purpose of my visit.",4,2018,11,18
30,"Good, bad and ugly","The good is that on the surface this hotel looks nice. The lobby is nice, the staff are nice, the rooms are nice. 
The bad is the food is average at best and lacking variety and actual flavour.
The ugly is that the hotel is in the middle of nowhere and after midnight with a conference of over 100 people the bar is closed. No exceptions.",1,2018,11,13
30,Not really a 5-star hotel,"The hotel looks nice from the outside, but after a few minutes in an apartment you realize that it's far from how a 5-star hotel should look. There were only a few hangers for two and just one pair of slippers, cheap hygiene items, room phones were not working at all... Of course they got us an additional pair after we asked, but hey, they knew there would be two guests. Metal parts of mirrors were covered with rust and furniture looked quite outdated. One day our apartment keys stopped working for an unknown reason and we had to get them replaced. The hotel is located close to the airport but far from the city center, so you decide whether it's good or bad. Otherwise everything was just fine.",4,2018,11,12
30,Be prepared to check out early,"Located about the mid point between BCN airport and downtown Barcelona.  So, if you plan to visit downtown, this would not be your choice.  
Facility is nice and stuff are very kind.  The issue is elevator traffic.  
I stayed at 13th floor (14th in US system) and I had to wait for over 10 min to get on to check out.  That made me almost miss my ride to the downtown.  
While I stay at this hotel 2 nights, I gave up twice to get on the elevator and took the emergency stairs outside of the elevator tower to join meetings in time.  
Several others did the same even though it was raining in one of the mornings.",3,2018,11,04
30,Good service and convenient for the airport,"Spent 4 nights at a conference in the hotel. Very convenient for the event, excellent breakfast with good variety but a bit busy at peak times. The lifts were always a problem in the morning while spending 10-15 minutes sometimes waiting for them on the floor. Eventually used stairs on the outside to walk down, but it is 29 stories hotel! Bar on the ground was fine, restaurant was excellent with good food and friendly service. 

10 minutes to the airport and close to the metro station to the centre of Barcelona. Unfortunately on the last stop so a bit of a commute to the centre - 40 minutes. But no need to change. 

Internet was good and accessible from most of the places in the hotel and the conference facilities with good speed.

Nice large bed, good large bathroom.

Water was missing which was a bit of a concern for a 5 star hotel.

Also the fridge was off and this was a problem across the entire hotel and couldn‚Äôt be fixed?! They offered ice but not the same.

",4,2018,10,31
30,Impeccable!,"NH Collection Barcelona Tower is a 4-star business hotel with great luxury rooms and it's excepcional reception/bar floor.
Just stayed one night but everything was perfect, from the fast check in to the ultra fast check out.
Great views from Barcelona and a very good place to stay. 
Taxi to Barcelona center is around 20‚Ç¨.",4,2018,10,25
30,Warm and enjoyable experience in NH,The breakfast provided was so delicious that I fully experienced the Spanish cuisine.The bed is also very comfortable and can enjoy a comfortable sleep after a whole day work.Easy to get to the hotel from the airport,4,2018,10,24
30,Canceled flight ,We were put here by easyJet when are flight to Bristol was canceled. We were here for three nights very nice hotel the restaurant was a bit posh for us but nice breakfast and there is a metro across the road in the hospital that goes in too the city takes about 30 minutes so quite good location,4,2018,10,15
30,Good price.,Good price and nice rooms but location is not very good for visiting Barcelona's important visitor's sights. Breakfast is busy and chaotic and staff work very hard to give service to everyone at the same time. Maybe more like a business hotel than tourist hotel.,4,2018,10,12
30,Perfect hotel!,"Dear Tower,

I would like to say ""Muchas gracias!"" for my staying this summer and last year too. Everything was perfect! Delicious breakfasts and amazing view through the window) Very kind and professional staff!  I'm going to stay here next year. It was really a love from my first staying! I cannot find any bad things. So, my choice is you :-) I also appreciate free shuttle service from (to) the airport and if it's possible I want you to organize a shuttle service to the centre of the city as well as to Gava beach like it was in 2017.
I recommend this wonderful 5 stars hotel to everyone who wants to enjoy staying in Barcelona! 

Victoria, with love.",5,2018,10,07
30,Excellent hotel,"An excellent hotel. The hotel shuttle will collect you from the parking of the airport. Shuttle timings are mentioned on the website. Be patient. We took the shuttle and in no time we reached the hotel. It‚Äôs away from the centre but the underground is just 500 yards from the hotel. Apartment neat to the hotel has shopping area for daily routine so you can get your mineral water, drinks bakery items etc and halal food is also available. Staff is very courteous and helpful. Room is excellent with beautiful bathroom and dressing room. Loved every minute there.",5,2018,09,27
30,Overnight Transit Stop,"I had booked the hotel a month before and even called the hotel days before arriving and still I was given a room with two single beds pushed together when a king room had been booked. I was told they had no other rooms available which I didn't really believe. 

The TV hardly worked, the two main English channels BBC and CNN were just not on screen despite being apparently available. 

One guy tried to rectify it and couldn't and then eventually I was told a technician would come so I waited and waited and when I asked was told it would be the next day but they would change my room - funny that considering they'd told me the place was full.

The hotel hallways and rooms are quite dark in the colour schemes. No iron and ironing board int eh room you had to ask for it, no coffee or tea int eh room, no tissues provided in the bathroom and this is supposed to be NH high level brand.

The breakfast was pretty good.

The elevator system was a joke and a nightmare. They is not a conventional system and in the morning it was pathetically slow and accessing it was not good. Elevators appeared to have a mind of their own and stopped on every floor even when it did not need to. You have to allocate plenty of time to use the elevators.

It is reasonably convenient to the airport but while the hotel has a free shuttle service it is incredibly irregular - there is not a frequent service.

I would not stay here if its more than one night.",3,2018,09,23
30,Close to the airport ,The hotel is close to the airport with free shuttle service. The room was spacious and the staff was professional. The carpet was kind of dirty but is an easy fix. Metro station about four blocks and it will take about 30 minutes to plaza Catalu√±a..,4,2018,09,15
30,Top!,"Amazing hotel in all its conforts, specially noted the friendly staff and a proper buffet breakfast.
Rooms feature amazing city views,and a new concept of bathroom (you enter the room by it, and the room follows, making it very user-friendly.
All in all, a great experience",5,2018,08,28
30,Weekend break,"Clean hotel with a great bar and amazing view. It is located within a short walk of the metro into the town centre or a short taxi ride. The staff seem friendly and accomodating. The breakfast was good but
could be improved.",4,2018,08,27
30,Nice place and good value for money,"Very good value for money, even not so close to downtown.
The swimming pool nearby is great.
Take the executive pack to have free access to the pool and to Executive Lounge (free snacks and beverages)",5,2018,08,27
30,Good business hotel,Good business hotel where I stayed for a conference. Good location very very close to the airport (5 mins of taxi drive). Nice view from the top bar and from the glass elevator. Breakfast with wide choice despite not everything I tasted was good. Recommended in case of need of staying close to the airport.,4,2018,08,23
30,Interesting,"Located close to the airport, the hotel lures you with spacious & well-appointed rooms, superb views of the surrounding areas and a huge lobby with good seating area. Quiet neighbourhood with good connectivity to the city centre.",5,2018,08,20
30,Excellent hotel,"Excellent Hotel, very modern decor. Had two suites and love them, city view is beautiful at night. Good breakfast, happy with staff manners , friendly staff.

Excellent cleaning service.

One thing to change- entrance has smoking area and I think it should be on one side rather people smoking just on entrance .",5,2018,08,19
30,DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT 5 STAR LUXURY ,"ARRIVAL

Arrived at the hotel using the free shuttle service offered by the hotel, which was extremely useful and prompt. Hotel is approximately 10mins from Barcelona-El Prat

The reception/ lobby area is nice and modern in its appearance. At check-in I was greeted by Orlando and Maria, who were very helpful. 

Having read the trip advisor reviews, I decided to upgrade to the premium room at check-in, as I understood that the superior room lacked some simply facilities such as a kettle in the room and did not allow access to the fitness centre. 

As soon as you take the lift up from the lobby to your room, the appearance of the hotel changes drastically for the worse. Dated green carpets ?! Boring decor leading to the rooms, no artwork,no flair !

PREMIUM ROOM

The upgrade to the premium room cost an additional 25‚Ç¨ per night.

Received complimentary chocolates and a 1 litre bottle of water. Didn‚Äôt drink or eat any of the mini bar items, as they were outrageously priced, for what they were. Bought a multi pack of water for under 2‚Ç¨ from a store a few blocks away. 

The premium room includes coffee machine, 2 toilets, 2 wash basins, 2 large TVs, sofa bed, kingsize bed, bath and shower. 

The view from the room is uninspiring, just roads and highways. 

The room was a decent size but the decor of the room is very dated and not on par with other 5 star hotels, I‚Äôve stayed in. In terms of cleanliness, the room was clean, no complaints there. 

I did notice a few minor defects in the room - such as stained lamp shade, stained carpets, pink scratch in the bath and missing shower fixture. I called the front desk to report these issues and they sent a Bell boy to the room. 

The bell boy Chabby noted these issues and told me that due to the demand for the hotel, they have little to no time for maintenance to repair things such as these. Chabby also proceeded to speak to my friend and I about the duplex room and the hotels other ‚Äòamazing suites‚Äô - I‚Äôm not sure why, considering I‚Äôd already paid to upgrade this was of zero relevance to me!

I found this excuse about maintenance absolutely outrageous but as I was assured by the member of staff, that he would arrange for the shower fixture to be repaired the following day, I let it go (The missing shower fixture was not replaced for the duration of my stay!)

The only English television channel is BBC news and was unavailable ‚Äòno signal‚Äô, which is very frustrating as there aren‚Äôt even subtitles, for the Catalan/Spanish channels!

LOCATION

The hotel is extremely isolated and almost depressing being so far away from the action. If you want to be near the best attractions of Barcelona, NH Collection Barcelona Tower or NH Fira Suites (hotel less than 2mins away), are not the hotels for you, unless you don‚Äôt mind commuting a minimum  of 15-25 mins, daily.

AXIS BAR

We ate at the Axis bar a few hours after arriving, simply because there are no restaurants, within walking distance. My friend and I ordered a burger and fries 19.50‚Ç¨ each and cokes 4.50‚Ç¨- Daylight robbery! I imagine the hotel get away with the pricing, as they are aware that on the food front it‚Äôs slim pickings!

The food took forever to come, was not piping hot and the burgers were medium-rare, rather than medium-well, as we had requested, to our dismay. The waitress did offer to take it back, however we declined having started eating the burgers and being genuinely hungry after our travels. We left more than half of the food. 

Apart from my friend and I there was a small family of 4 dining at one of the other tables in the restaurant. There were 2 waitresses working at the bar, busying themselves with God knows what, since the place was virtually empty! 

My friend and I waited approximately 20 minutes for our plates to be collected, until I got fed up of waiting and walked to the bar to collect the bill myself. 

The service we received was diabolical considering it was just us and one other table dining that afternoon. My friend and I decided there and then, that would be our first and last meal at the hotel. Our booking did not include breakfast, which is priced at 25‚Ç¨ per person, per day - ridiculous to say the least, we were not willing to try or pay for it. 

FITNESS CENTRE

The fitness centre is outside of the hotel. You can collect ticket each day from reception, to use the facilities each day, if you book the premium room. Fitness centre is great and fully equipped. 

This hotel is far from 5 star luxury. Would not recommend or stay here again due to location, lack of nearby restaurants, poor customer service and sub standard room. 

For an amazing hotel stay I‚Äôd recommend the Melia Sarria, stayed there last year - incredible !

This hotel is massively underwhelming and disappointing. Regret staying here. ",1,2018,08,17
30,We got upgraded room due to two times broken glass. No towels? Check out too much mistakes.,"We booked two double rooms for one week.we found out one of the room has broken glass in the armoire. As we have kid, we requested to change. After we change, incredibly,we found out much bigger broken glass right in the big french window !! It‚Äôs too too dangerous. The staff was surprised too, and apologized, and upgraded our room to a suite. I think they invested a lot of money to build this tower, but maintainence  is not sufficient. Then about service, one day we found there is no towels in the room, I requested to reception and they said will bring immediately. Wait for whole evening, no one comes. And there is even no towels for the second day?! When check out, it‚Äôs totally a mess, they said we used mini bar, but no, we didn‚Äôt. And they said we have ticket for the spa?! I told them we didn‚Äôt know where is the spa.....And then two staff calculated differently the city tax...Too much mistakes. I would admit they have comfortable bed, but that‚Äôs it. Thanks for upgrading for us. But with my experience, I won‚Äôt come back again.",2,2018,08,15
30,Beautiful Hotel,I stayed here for one night because my flight got cancelled. The staff were very helpful and the room was wonderful. Breakfast was good. We used the shuttle to the airport. I wish I had more time to explore.,5,2018,08,13
30,Hesperia Tower Hotel,"This hotel is located way out of the Barcelona hubbub where all the activities are happening and is about 10 minutes ride to the airport.  They offer a free shuttle van service to and from the airport but their promptness is not dependable‚Äîwe had to wait almost an hour under the sweltering heat without covers for them to arrive to pick us up. It is an ideal place if you want a quiet location.  The hotel is about 5 minutes walk to the L1 Metro and at the end of the tube line.  First thing I noticed is that it is a beautiful, contemporary hotel but some areas of carpeting are stained and looked dirty.  Also, the lounge chairs in the lobby looked unkempt. Our room shower is good but the body sprays are not working properly and need fixing which we failed to mention to the management.  A minor intrusion happens twice daily whenever the mini bar in our room is checked. There was no coffee nor tea in the room.  Breakfast buffet is pricey at about ‚Ç¨25 per person. No ice machine is provided so we had to call room service for ice.  Water is also not available so we had to walk a few blocks to the store to purchase them.  One positive note though, we dined late at their Bouquet Restaurant and we‚Äôre very pleased with our food and the service staff were outstanding.  They did not rush us even though they were closing.  Front desk staffs are all helpful and we‚Äôre able to speak English‚Äînot too many in Barcelona speak it though.  The taxis were on strike during the week of our stay and their shuttle van don‚Äôt service their customers to get to our next destination even though we are willing to pay so we had to drag our heavy luggage and bags and backpacks through different Metro lines‚Äîthat was a big inconvenience (not the hotel‚Äôs fault but at least they should offer their service when an unexpected event happens).",3,2018,08,10
30,Happy to choose it,We stayed at in Hesperia Tower for just one last night before our flight. It was a realy nice 5 star hotel with the good value for money.We were in 22th floor and the view was awesome. We didn‚Äôt have time to have breakfast or use the facilities such as gym or pool so I did not pay for them and it was the main point of the good price.There was kettle and minibar in our room which was so useful for having a coffee before leave the hotel to the airport. The location was near metro station and it was enough for us. There were a free shuttle to the airport with special schedule. We used it and It was perfect. Staff were so helpful and professional. I am so glad to choose this hotel and It was beyond my expectations.,5,2018,08,10
30,That‚Äôs not included in your room,Currently staying here and have a week left. The gym is not included in the room it‚Äôs ‚Ç¨12 each each day. Also if you want to make tea and coffee forget about it that‚Äôs not included in the room you have to get room service coffee. Metro is quiet close and room is descent but you are literally getting a room 30min on th metro out of town or ‚Ç¨25 in a taxi. The rooftop bar is only open on weekends and so the restaurant you are forced to eat in is on level 2 with no veiw. I ordered paella and was told it would take too long too cook can I order amount else are they are closing soon. Not really worth the ‚Ç¨80 price tag for dinner. Good luck if you have booked this place!,1,2018,08,10
30,Ideal 'just out of town' luxury,"Knowing how busy central Barcelona can be I decided to try Hesperia Tower in the Hospitalet region just to the West of central Barcelona.
The hotel and staff are excellent and location ideal for whar I was looking for. It is situated at the end of the L1 Metro line so getting a tube, well, anywhere in Barcelona is a breeze from here.
The room included access to the hotels Tower Club (basically a very well stocked airport lounge) complete with luxurious sofas, meeting rooms and Bang and Olufsen sound system.
The accommodation rooms themselves are to a very high standard, although not the highest standard rooms I've visited in other 5 star hotels.
Not many negatives to dwell on but, this is a review so they need explaining. The dome shape Bar 360 on the roof of the hotel was out of action during our stay, disappointing as we had hoped for some great views from it. A couple of unfixed damages in the room, split in the bath, leaking shower door. And water and tissues were not replaced as part of the daily clean. These did in no way tarnish our stay there however.
Dined once in the Hotel's Bouquet restaurant, as a vegetarian the choice wasn't huge (but this is the case everywhere in Barcelona) but the food and atmosphere was good.
The hotel gives access to a gym and pool which adjoins it. Again, very well equipped and good standard.
Just 10 minutes from the airport and having had a really pleasant stay there I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Hesperia Tower to fellow travellers.",4,2018,08,08
30,Good hotel but bad airport transportation after hours,"This hotel was clean and nice. The beds were comfortable and our room had a wonderful view. However, transportation in Barcelona is terrible especially with the taxi strike going on and hotel shuttle is not available after 8 PM to pick you up from the airport. It was a lot of hassle for us to get to the hotel at 11 PM with no idea how to get around. Later found out that bus N17 drops you off half a mile away from the hotel. The bus is located in Terminal 2. ",4,2018,08,01
30,Brilliant find,"This hotel was amazing!, it looks really industrial from the exterior but it‚Äôs really chic and modern inside. I had booked this hotel for a few days while we were on our first family holiday, our suite was absolutely jaw droppingly stunning. It made our stay in Barcelona relaxed and luxurious, coming back from a long day at the beach to a jacuzzi bath, sensational! Staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the city and the room service was amazing. Although it is close to the airport and the motorway, it was quiet and far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city. Thank you so much for our great stay. ",5,2018,07,30
30,Nice hotel,"Close to the airport, big rooms with view, great breakfast, close to metro station and the Gran Fira congress centre but 15 minutes away by car from the city centre of Barcelona. There were taxi available out of the hotel most of the time.",4,2018,07,16
30,Decent hotel,We only stayed here over night before a morning flight the next day.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  There doesn't appear to be much of anything else close to the hotel but it is just ten minutes to the airport.,4,2018,07,15
30,Great hotel,I highly recommend this hotel if you need a place near the airport. The staff were great. The whole hotel was very modern and hip. What I really liked was the tremendous fitness faculty near by that you can use,5,2018,07,09
30,Falling at the first hurdle,"This was our first time at this hotel and it failed the sniff test, quite literally.  Once the room door swung open the smell of stale smoke was very evident.  We always book non-smoking rooms when we can but when I complained on checkout was told the hotel had been busy and that was why we had been given a smoking room.  So it was obviously my problem, with no ownership of the issue or recompense offered for spending the night breathing in other people‚Äôs stale smoke.
We had indeed arrived late the night before (thanks to a shambolic performance by Vueling Airlines ‚Äì see separate review) and what followed was like something out of a TV sitcom.  After a day of being messed around we simply wanted a relaxing drink.  We were on Floor 21 and the legend on the lift said there was a bar on Floor 3.  Down we went but there a private family dinner complete with photographer going on, no bar.  We walked down to Floor 2 to the restaurant where the maitre d‚Äô announced the nearest bar was on the ground floor behind reception.  He was right but when we got there there was no human standing behind it.  Off to reception.  The barman must be there, said the clerk.  Back to the bar.  Still no human until I looked for and found him ‚Äì in his stockroom. I‚Äôm closed, he said.  Unbelievable - it was only 10.30pm.  There is a bar on Floor 30, he said.  We gave up.
The room was decent-sized, the bed OK though the springs squeaked when you sat on it, the ac efficient, the bathroom quite large and elegant.  It was quiet and we had a good night‚Äôs sleep ‚Äì just as well given we had an early start.  For that reason we cannot comment on the place‚Äôs food offerings.  We return in September having booked some months ago. We will see if things are better.
Tip: Avoid the 21st floor if, like most people these days, you don‚Äôt smoke.",3,2018,07,02
30,Amaaazzingggg hotell,"I loved everything about the hotel! The rooms, breakfast, location, SERVICEü§©!! Litterly everything :-D

30,Probably the Best Hotel for Barcelona Airport,"This is a comfortable, modern 5-star hotel which is reasonably priced.  Bedrooms and bathrooms are attractive and comfortable.  The lift system not only copes well with the building's height but has an original intelligent selection system.

Location: on the edge of the unlovely settlement of Hospitalet, it is conveniently on the Gran V√≠a which leads to the centre of Barcelona in one direction and to BCN Airport, Tarragona, Lleida, Sitges etc. in the other.  There is an airport shuttles service.  Nearby are located a large IKEA store and the Fira Gran V√≠a (trade fairground) plus various corporate installations, offices and showrooms.  It is not suited to exploring the nocturnal delights of Barcelona on foot, although communications are generally good.  If you get very bored or lonely there is a billboard on the highway from the airport advertising ""apricots"".

Parking: there is an excellent underground garage payment of which is conveniently detached from hotel reception.

A hotel to be greatly recommended if you are in transit!",4,2018,06,28
30,"Very good hotel, question mark on the 5-star","In Barcelona for several days for business. This hotel is close to the airport (15 mn), but far from downtown - not an issue for me. Hotel staff really kind and helpful, restaurant is very nice as well, reasonable price.
Room was big, nice bathroom but tile needs to be replaced at some places. I'm curious about the 5-star especially without having swimming pool or gym. But anyway a good hotel for the price.",4,2018,06,20
30,Interesting Hotel,"I was impressed with the seemingly state of the art features found within the NH Barcelona Tower Hotel.  The property offers a free round-trip airport shuttle, in addition to well appointed rooms with a lot of features and comforts.  The staff was very professional and helpful..The only downside of my stay is that I had to pay 5 euros because I needed an EU power adapter.  Whenever I've stated at 4-5 star hotels in Europe, the rooms have USB ports and/or the property will offer adapters to use.",4,2018,06,15
30,"Good, but not perfect","Clean and very spacious rooms. Great breakfast selection
Almost no wifi in room & very slow in conference room
Some issues during check in & check out
Location near business district
Lack of fresh air in rooms
",3,2018,06,13
30,Far from the city,"Hesperian Tower is ultra modern but it‚Äôs very far from central Barcelona.  They have an excellent breakfast buffet but it is sure chaos early morning, so many people it was difficult to find a place to sit. The halls are very stuffy.  There was an awful smell outside the hotel entrance.  I was part of a tour group otherwise I would choose a hotel more central.",3,2018,06,11
30,Very clean and crisp ,Stayed here while waiting to board a cruise ship. Room was a very high quality with fantastic amenities. The staff were very friendly and helpful even though we got delayed and missed one night of the accommodation. Had a very enjoyable pizza and salad with local wine in the wine bar on the ground floor. Reasonable prices but the food was excellent. Happy to recommend and return in the future. Great location if you plan a day or so and need to get to a planned cruise close by.,4,2018,06,10
30,"This should be 4 star, not 5 star","The hotel is ok from the inside. The rooms are spacious. the bed is great, the bathroom too, but the carpet had many stains and should be renewed. The water out of the tap had a strong chloride taste and there was no free bottle of water: you have to bring your own or pay a lot of money. Breakfast had a lot of choice but he bread was not fresh. The neighborhood is safe, but not very inspirational and no other restaurant to be seen.. so we ate in the hotel twice, which was good. So for business visit ok, but is not ' the top'.",3,2018,06,09
30,Great frist experience in Barcelona,"We arrived at the hotel in the AM, but were able to leave our luggage while we toured the city. Although the hotel is located far from the city center, it is well worth it. The staff was very accommodating and helped us with the different sightseeing places. Our room on the 16th floor was impeccable and clean. We decided to give the restaurant a try, and we were not sorry! Both the food and service were exceptional! We liked it so much, we had dinner there a second time. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,06,08
30,Business hotel near airport,"This hotel is the Best location to airport, but not to town. Great views from the upper rooms. Most of the people staying here seemed to be here for business. This is an older hotel and its showing its age. Carpets are dirty and paint is needed in some places. Breakfast was really bad and expensive, but the next closest breakfast is miles away so you are kinda trapped. Hotel has no sign outside indicating the name (NH Collection Tower), but the Taxi drivers just know it as ""The Tower"". we were not even sure we were in the right place at first. They have an airport shuttle, but it only goes to terminal 1. Terminal 2 is a long way away and you have to take another bus, so if you are pressed for time, better to take a taxi straight to terminal 2. Bar is adequate.",3,2018,06,05
30,Very big,"Stayed with our group for two nights. Staff at front desk friendly. Ice cold water available for visitors. Entering our room,  there was rubbish on bench left by someone. Went to clean hands and basin full of dust. Went to have a courtesy cup of tea - cup was chipped and cracked. Took it to reception for replacement - four hours later we had to ring again twice for replacement . Had dinner with friends . Service fantastic. Food delicious and reasonably priced. 
Bed was hard and squeaky. Air conditioning easy to manage. 
Breakfast was included and was sumptuous . Chinese visitors were a bit forceful in the dining room. Out for the day. Room not attended to. 
For those that need internet, provide your own . Absolutely atrocious and front staff tried so hard to help us as we were trying to check in . Computer slow and hopeless. 
Easy check out time and courtesy car provided. Very punctual.
Close to airport. Easy to get train on line one into the city",3,2018,05,29
30,Good hotel!,I liked staying in the Hesperia Tower Hotel in Barcelona. Good quality of everything. A perfect view from 18th floor on the Barcelona and so on. Friendly personal. I suggest this place and will be glad to stay there again. ,4,2018,05,03
30,"Modern, high tech, NOT warm or cozy","When I travel, I love comfort and cozy. This hotel did not have either.  Everything looked good, but was not comfortable. It's a super high tech hotel that takes a long time to figure out how to turn the shower on and work the air conditioning, and good luck working the TV.  There were no comfortable places to lounge.They even charge you extra if you want to use the pool or jacuzzi. At $250 a night, that's ridiculous! ",2,2018,04,30
30,Average Stay,"We had no problems checking in, the staff were nice, and the room was nice. I found the hotel very modern and darkly decorated, which is not my taste. There is nothing pulling me to go back, but not a bad stay.",3,2018,04,27
30,Can't complain about a thing ,"Great hotel and really friendly staff. The gym and spa next door is amazing. It's ‚Ç¨12 to use but worth every penny. (you need flip flops and to swim a swimming cap) I got flip flops from reception ‚Ç¨1.50
Lobby bar is nice and restaurant is comfortable although not cheap.
I thought the room was amazing value for money and the gym and spar second to non
Would happily return :-) ",5,2018,04,25
30,Disappointing Stay,"I was at this hotel for a business conference last week. I travel a lot so certainly have seen most, I don't expect perfection with hotels but certainly some basics are important.
hotel was clean, seemed to be well kept. 
They shut the AC off at night to conserve power, whole trip we woke up early am every night ( 4 - 5am ) with room too warm to sleep and we could'nt do anything about it. Hotel staff said they do not shut AC off at night to conserve power, basically lied to my face, many other people at same conference complained about same issue.
Poor location, need to take a cab to go to anything
Service in bars and restaurants at hotel is about the worst I've seen. Have a seat, we will ignore you till you leave....",1,2018,04,24
30,Excellent!,"I stayed one night at this hotel because my flight got delayed and I had to stay one night in Barcelona. I needed something close to the airport and the choice fell on this hotel - and I could not have been happier with my decision!

I booked online and checked in an hour later - absolutely problem-free. 

The hotel is huge and has plenty of facilities. The room was beautiful and the view was breathtaking. The staff was extremely friendly and patient with me.

I enjoyed free transfer to the airport. This hotel had everything I needed and much more. They made my stay in Barcelona a very comfortable one.

I highly recommend this hotel and will for sure come back!",5,2018,04,19
30,"Old hotel, far from town, close to airport, reasonable price for Barcelona","The Hesperia Tower is a mixed bag.  It's a large hotel close to the airport so if you're flying out early in the morning it's probably a good choice.  (3 stars)

The room itself feels a little dated & dark.  The bathroom has more mirrors & black granite than I've ever seen in my life.  I had numerous people tell me they all felt at risk of walking into a wall or door because there's so many reflections in there.  I sat on the couch & a giant cloud of dust exploded upward.  Like all hotel rooms that haven't been refreshed in years it felt a little dusty & tired.  (3 stars)

Service at the bars/restaurants was hit or miss.  Sometimes it was attentive and sometimes you could wait 15 minutes for someone to take notice of you.  Like all big hotels I felt as if the food was all coming from the same kitchen and it was ehh.  (2 stars)

Location, while close to the airport it's about a 15-20 Euro cab ride to anywhere in the city that you'd want to go.  So, if you actually came to Barcelona to see Barcelona you can add 40 Euros a day to the cost of getting in & out of the city.  Spend an extra 20 Euros a night and you could be in the center of Barcelona within walking distance of hundreds of sites, restaurants, clubs, theaters, etc.  Let's be blunt, there isn't anything to do right around this hotel.  (1 star)

Infuriating moment; I was booked into the tower for a 5 night stay.  After the 3rd night I decided to change hotels to be in the city.  So, I went to the front desk after the 3rd night & said I wanted to change my reservation and leave a day early.  Would that be a problem?  The desk clerk types into his system for about 30 seconds and says, ""No problem"" I've changed it.  I go to check out then next morning at noon and the new desk clerk says I show you here for another night.  I said, no, I came down and changed it yesterday.  Ok, she takes my credit card runs it and asks if I want a detailed receipt.  Yes, please.  As I'm walking to the curb I'm thinking about it and the price seems a little high so I open up the receipt and they've charged me for 5 nights.  I go back in and speak to the desk clerk, she informs me that my reservation can't be changed.  I protest, she talks to another desk clerk who comes over and tells me ""Sorry, hotel policy, you can't change the reservation"".  I spend 100/nights a year in hotels for work & have for 20 years, I can't remember this ever happening to me before on anything other than a pre-paid stay.  I gave them over 24 hours notice and no one actually told me there was any consequences to leaving early I had to figure it out for myself.  I'm sorry but that's borderline deceitful.  (0 stars)

As much as I'd like to give them 1 star I can't in good conscience.  There were some redeeming qualities about the hotel and reviews should take into consider the good & the bad.  However, I have a strict you only get to take advantage of me once rule so I'll never be back to this hotel or the NH Hotels chain again.",2,2018,04,19

The hotel was absolutely beautiful, the view from our room was amazing, breakfast was delicious there was a variety of food to have, we ordered room service Sunday night and the food was also delicious!

Great room. Nicely designed hotel. Modern, has all the creature comforts. Got a room with two floors (loft style). Huge bathtub. Trendy. 

Staff initially put us in a smoking floor/room. For no real reason. That‚Äôs just poor form, especially with tired travelers at 1am. 

Asked room service to send up a burger. At 2:45am gave up. It doesn‚Äôt take 45+ mins to get room service to send up a burger. Kept calling and they said 5 mins away. That was for nearly 20+ mins. I had to tell them to cancel the order and hang up on them because they kept making excuses. 

The phone system here is also terrible. You hit 8 to get room service and nothing happens. So you have to keep hitting 8 over and over again.

Bad design of night light switch. You have to leave the bed to switch off. 

They charge 6‚Ç¨ for each bottle of water. I also had to pay for a power adapters on connect my PC. First 5 star hotel I encountered doing this. 

Isolated location with no nearby options. ",1,2018,02,27
30,Solid hotel with easy access to airport and metro,"Good hotel, the staff was very friendly and available to help.  The hotel is easily located near the airport, took a 20 euro taxi as the shuttle is not continuous.   The hotel is an easy 5 minute walk to the metro and takes you to las Ramblas in less then 25 minutes.   The room was nice and the bathroom was huge, the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is some elements of the room seemed a bit dated (couch and carpet).  Overall great stay at a good price.

30,Fantastic,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in, and I travel all over the world.  The lobby decor is luxury modern with huge flowers in huge vases, transparent floors with colorful lighting, very good food in the restaurants.  The quiet rooms (we had a premium room with city view that faced the airport) have oversize windows and blackout electric curtains and the totally marble bathroom, black and gray, had separate toilet and shower areas. The shower head disk was about a foot in diameter and there were 6 jets on the wall as well. Lighted makeup mirror attached to the wall. The bed was top of the line, sheets and pillows of very good quality, wifi was fast, and all was spotlessly clean.  I actually hated to leave, which rarely happens to me anymore.  Friendly and helpful staff as well.  Really a first class hotel, new, stylish and reasonably priced close to the airport and free shuttle.",5,2018,02,20
30,ALNEYADI13,"Upon my stay on 15-16 / 02/2018, I was greeted with a smile and welcomed by Al-Sadr and the room procedures were cleared by employee Gisselle. I thank the hotel management for its selection.
I have a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Spanish people that they love all the peoples and have no racism against others. So better than working in Spanish hotels to be Spanish only",4,2018,02,18

Front Desk stuff was really friendly and helpful MR Roger and MS Gissely .. it was just one night stay dealing with them was like Family thank you so much

the food inside the hotel was great, the staff were very friendly. rooms were clean and modern. and a good view from my room. ",5,2018,02,11
30,Great Experience,Loved the staff and the breakfast buffet.  The rooms were very quite. I didn't hear my neighbors at all.  I used the subway which wasn't a far walk.  I also used the hotel van to and from the airport.  I would stay here again.  ,5,2018,02,07
30,Very pleasant stay,"NH collection Barcelona is very centrally located on the Rambla Catalu√±a. Recently refurbished it is a very good quality hotel. Breakfast buffet is good, staff is friendly. Had a room with a small terrace which was nice though the room was a little tight.
Highly recommend it.
",4,2018,01,26
30,Not a 5 star- nowhere near Barca centre,"I booked this hotel for my partner and I whilst visiting Barcelona as we wanted a 4 or 5 star hotel with good facilities, everything this hotel described when booking. 

However upon arrival we were shocked at the location of the hotel it's in the middle of a residential area with no shops or anything near by (literally not even a little corner shop to grab a bottle of water). The building itself looks a bit dated from the outside, the lobby and bar area were better. The man who checked us in took an age to do so, it was like watching paint dry! He didn't offer us any useful information about the area or things to do or even the hotel facilities.   

The rooms are ok but not 5 star. A double room consisted of two twin beds pushed together. As others have stated many of the furnishings looked a bit shabby and tired. At least two of the plug sockets didn't work. The shower was really powerful and lovely however once turned off it leaked and dripped for an hour or so after. None of the rooms have baths in them which after a hectic day being a tourist would have been lovely to come back to. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING is complimentary in this hotel. Everything is overpriced and low standard, a bottle of water from mini bar in room is ‚Ç¨6, Coca Cola ‚Ç¨4, a pot of almonds ‚Ç¨6 it's a rip off! Let's compare to say the Hilton doubletree chain hotel I have stayed in these many times and each time you receive a warm
Cookie and some water and hot drinks complimentary, is this difficult? NO! 

The spa is not part of the hotel you have to walk next door and pay which is overpriced and a cheek really I think! 

Worst thing about this hotel is it's location.....it's in the middle of nowhere and takes at least 25 mins on metro to get to centre. 

Would I stay here again.....no, there are far better places to stay for a lot less money. ",2,2018,01,21
30,great stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights with Trafalgar. If you're not willing to take the Metro, this hotel is about 10-20 minutes away from the city center and a taxi ride would cost around 15-20 euros. This is a modern hotel, with floor to ceiling windows. We got a suite and it was lovely.The rooms were clean and looks modern. Towels were nice and fluffy. Electrical outlets are everywhere. There was just no refrigerator inside the room and room service would gladly bring us ice if we asked for it. Front office were also really helpful if you need something. 

Also, don't forget to check out their rooftop bar for a view of the city.",4,2018,01,19
30,Middle of nowhere and they know it ,"Location
The hotel is around 15mins from the airport (which you can see from the rooms) and is in a very residential area close to the hospital and university. There are very few / no restaurants in the local area. It‚Äôs very isolated. There is a mini mart around a
10mins walk away but the area doesn‚Äôt feel very safe.

Rooms
Are disappointing for an NH collection hotel. The bathrooms have showers only and are fitted from the 90s with all around mirrors to make it look big. You walk straight in to the bathroom as you enter the room. Heating control is available. My room had a TV with local stations, a sofa and a double bed. There didn‚Äôt seem to be a pillow menu. There‚Äôs a mini bar at ridiculous prices and no free water which is normally found in NH collection hotels. Robes and slippers are provided.

Facilities
The hotel has a Sports Centre which is planned to visit (and the reason id booked the hotel over others as the pool looked a good size) but reviews on here saying it cost 12 euros stopped me. There is a restaurant on the 2nd floor which has a set menu for around 26euros or 35euros depending on your choice. The main menu is stupid pricing but they know they are in be middle of nowhere so price accordingly (pizza was 17euro from memory). There is a bar in the lobby. I tried to visit the panoramic bar but it wasn‚Äôt open. 

F&D
Breakfast is on the 4th floors and is a good selection of local and international foods. The bread selection could be better (no rolls unless I missed them). I didn‚Äôt eat beyond this at the hotel for the reasons above. There is a bar on the ground floor which follows the same ‚Äòwe are isolated so charge a fortune‚Äô policy. I asked for a glass of wine which was 5e and was presented with a thimble of wine (less than a UK 125measure). When I asked for a second as it was so small it didn‚Äôt even reach 2/3 up the glass which was a small glass. This is really taking advantage!

Going out
I decided to venture out and found a restaurant around a 15min walk away called  La Flama. This is a local traditional Barcelona restaurant with great food (don‚Äôt be put off by the appearance!). I‚Äôd suggest taking a taxi as the area does feel a little unsafe. The wine is 2e a glass for a proper glass!! And you will get very fresh tapa. You may need a little Spanish as the English menu has been taken from a translate programme- hake has become Iron fist!

30,Quick visit to ...gaudi's city.,"Gr8 hotel and very helpful staff ...we had an amazing experience.We were offered drink at reception and check in desk staff were warm and friendly.We used the club service which was well worth it. We found hotel clean and tidy.Lifts, lobby area, restaurant and reception was kept in good shape. I would definitely use this hotel in future if we go to Barcelona again. It is 15min drive from airport and taxis are available outside hotel if you plan to travel to city anytime.All in all it was good experience for me and my wife. ",5,2018,01,17
30,Great holiday stay,"Great hotel with warm helpful staff.  We always stay here when we visit Barcelona; it's far enough out of the city and has a plethora of wonderful small places to eat locally (for a fraction of the cost in the city).  However, well worth eating in the hotel - the food is really to die for!",5,2018,01,17
30,Good hotel but requires renovation ,"On a positive - Great view over the whole city. Convenient location, 10 minutes from the airport, 5 minute walk from metro. 15 minutes by metro to the city centre. 
SPA and gym in a big fitness centre. Long swimming pool, a lot of equipment, different SPA facilities. A lot to offer compared to other hotels.
Breakfast has gluten-free options - bread and cereal. Although not much for vegans, therefore too expensive to pay 25 euro per day for salad leaves, backed potato, beans and tomatoes.
Tower Club offers a variety of drinks, including alcohol. But snacks are not so great. 
Negative- it's not a 5* hotel, rather 4. Furniture is old and requires replacememt. Not all the staff is well trained. In the beginning we often had to call reception to ask for cups, coffee and other things, that should be always in the room. The reception often ignored our requests and didn't follow through with their promises. Which escalated to an official complaint involving management. They responded to it, upgraded to a better room and made sure that everything is functioning and clean. The last 2 days out of 7 we did spent in a 5* conditions. :) ",4,2018,01,09
30,1 star hotel,"My friend this is the low quality hotel i ever see in my life , surprise for every thing 
The rooms are dirty i mean incredible smell
Carpet full dust 
Bath smell
No chance to forget this low class hotel
I offer for managment hotel to change for 1star hotel
I am more surprise fir barcelona city responsible how they let this hotel to announce  5* 
This hotel is 1 star 
",1,2018,01,07
30,"Its a good hotel, but not a great hotel","A few things that might be helpful;
Not all rooms qualify for access to all the facilities. 

If you upgrade to the right room you get access to the Tower Club. That gives you free beer, spirits, wine soft drinks etc. There's also a selection of sandwiches and snacks. It might well be worth an upgrade depending on how long you'll stay. 

The fitness centre is a separate company. Again, not all rooms qualify. It's really impressive so probably worth upgrading the room. Make sure you get a voucher on check in, otherwise they won't let you in. Also you'll need a swimming hat for the pool. 

Parking is onsite and costs 15 euro more.

There's a very expensive and fairly tacky panoramic bar on the 29th floor. A gin and tonic will set you back 14 euro. 

Location is great for the airport and the hospital, but there's nothing within walking distance. 

It's a massive hotel so don't expect a personal touch, but generally it's a good value, well specced hotel.",4,2018,01,07
30,Super hotel ,"Fantastic rooms! We upgraded to a junior suite for only 110! It was just fabulous! Such a view.... Fantastic gym next door! Don't forget your swim cap! It's not part of hotel but you have full access and I'd highly recommend! 
We have free access to the lounges... free crisps nibbles and drinks! Perfect room to relax and read a book!! Highly recommend this for a business trip too it looked well equipped! 10 mins to airport! Parking underneath!! Room amazing.... Friendly staff! Highly rates great value for our money!",5,2018,01,06
30,Conference,"Check in was relatively quick. Room was split level and on first glance was very nice - however cleanliness wasn‚Äôt great - a couple of stains and sticky spots on the furniture and carpets in the living room. Bedroom was clean as was shower. Didn‚Äôt use the jacuzzi but it seemed clean. Window blinds didn‚Äôt close properly and windows were dirty. 

Comfortable bed , very quiet too. Plenty of towels , slippers and robes . Well stocked mini bar. 

Breakfast was very good. Lots of choice, good service too. 

Lunch was always plentiful and decent quality too. 

Bar service was slow but the staff were pleasant. 

No on hotel gym / pool - access is permitted in the leisure centre next soo and is charged at about 12 Euro per visit - this should be included in the room rate. I would have expected complimentary access in a hotel like this.

If room cleanliness was improved I would happily return for either business or leisure 
",4,2018,01,06
30,Final day of tour in Spain,"This has to be the best modern hotel I have stayed. The room is spacious with walk-in wardrobe, high tech shower and separate toilet. There are mirrors around to add depth to the room. The bed is super comfortable and I wish I could stay here a few days instead of over night. Taking the lift to the room is an experience, all done by computer access. Smoking area in front of hotel next to a pool of water. Breakfast was excellent with many choices to choose from. I hope to return here one day...",5,2018,01,04
30,The city is beautiful,"Just comeback from there and honestly I‚Äôm sure you can get find a better 5* hotel, it s annoying how a 5* star hotel doesn‚Äôt have the gym and the spa included, you have to pay extra for that and you have to walk outside the hotel for few minutes to get there! With the same money you can get a better 5* hotel in the city with all the facilities included 
Anyway the city is amazing, the most beautiful city i ever been in Europe",3,2017,12,31
30,A very nice place close by the city,"We stayed at this great hotel for one night this last week. We booked a Duplex Suite wich turned out to be a very good option, since we had a nice livingroom with two comfortable sofas + a table for two and a toilet. Upstairs, in the bedroom was the shower, another toilet and the jacuzzi. The views were stunning. 

Also a very nice feature was the lounge on the 5th floor, which we had access to, with free snacks and drinks (all kinds) all day long. We would specially like to thank Marta who was there that afternoon for the attentive care up to the detail that she gave us. 
We will definitely come back. ",5,2017,12,30
30,"Stunning hotel, but quite a distance from the Marina","Great rooms and great facilities at this hotel.

Service was very good and everywhere was clean.

Unfortunately when we visited, the restaurant at the top of the hotel was closed and shut down which were were not advised on booking.

The distance to the marina and the main attractions of Barcelona are quite a distance away so taxi's can be quite expensive each trip.

They do offer a shuttle bus but this is not advertised nor does it run frequently.

I would stay here again as it was a very pleasant stay.",4,2017,12,20
30,Very good place with few issues,The hotel is really strange but very nice. Good location for the airport but very far from city center. Airport shuttle has few rides. Breakfast outstandng. Rooms are reasonably clean even in some parts dusty and with spotted moquestte. Bathroom very big and clean. Very cold hotel specially bathrooms.,4,2017,12,20
30,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful service!",I had very enjoyable stay here for a convention event. The staffs are so friendly and provided me a lot of useful information about Barcelona. A special rate set dinner in the restaurant for room guest is fantastic! The room is luxurious designed with wide stunning view! I will stay here again for my next trip.,4,2017,12,10
30,"Classy, very nice, rooms are awesome and the view uncomparable","Very nice option if you look for a classy state of the art luxury hotel in Barcelona. Not far from the Airport. The view from the rooms is just awesome, and the room decoration and confort is top class. The bar area in the lobby is very nice to have a drink and relax for a wile. The elevator system is somehow strange, not really very user friendly, but that's just a detail. Over all, my evaluation and experience there was very positive, it's definetly a hotel I will go back to one of these days. Highly recomendamos the tower if you plan on going to Barcelona!!",5,2017,12,06
30,Perfect Location close to the airport,I have stayed in this hotel a number of times and find it extremely convenient. The style of the hotel is modern and the bedrooms are very comfortable and spacious. The beds are great quality with fantastic pillows. Lots of room in the bathroom. I have used the pool before in autumn and it was lovely. The free shuttle to and from the airport is very convenientand a huge plus. My only complaint was the lack of choice on the room service menu and the fact they couldnt change anything at all on it(add extra cheese)- its a shame when you are use to such amazing food in Barcelona. Apart from that i would highly recommend the hotel,4,2017,12,06
30,Lovely!,"Short stay visit in Barcelona for our wedding anniversary. This place is just on the outskirts of the main city and right by the airport. Tourist stuff could be a bit of treck into town but luckily there is a Metro station within 5 mins. 

The rooms were very nice and had good A.C.and at the time of year we went it was essential! The views were good. Although we were on the wrong side. 

The staff were very accommodating, but the restaurant on the top level wasn't open.

The main thing for me was room quality. As we didn't spend much time at the hotel, it was pleasant enough. The mini bar is quite expensive though in the room!

30,Fantastic Stay & Courteous Staff,"I had stayed at this hotel as we had a conference here, it is conviniently located close to the airport with very good connectivity to the Metro. The rooms are very spacious, clean and tastefully done. The buffet food is ok, but they do have a wide and sumptuous  selection in the menu. As it is located a little bit away from the hustle bustle of the city the stay is very peaceful. Definitely recommended for a business stay and even if you want to explore the beautiful city of Barcelona... ",5,2017,11,18
30,Excellent venue for a conference and close to the airport.,Stayed here for several days in early November while attending a workshop. The hotel is in a modern tower block with 20+ floors - an ugly building on the outside but the interior is much better. Check in was quick and efficient and my room was well appointed overall. Narrow beds but a comfortable night's sleep. The best feature of the room was the bathroom and the shower was one of the best I have experienced in almost any hotel. Breakfast was the usual buffet style but a bit underwhelming on the whole. The lunches and evening dinners were very good and the bar was good too. The hotel is situated away from the city centre but the metro station was nearby so getting in was very straightforward. An ideal venue for a conference or workshop with many rooms of differing sizes so they can cater from small to very large groups. Recommended overall.,4,2017,11,17
30,anonymous,"Great view, rooms, very good sleeping and eaing in restaurants. Superior Bars incl. Roof top 360¬∞ bar. I can recommend this as a conference and private stay hotel.

30,Hip and Cool,"NH Collection Hesperia Tower was a great hotel. From the cool lounge to the attentive staff, all was pleasant. It is about 20 minutes outside the city, but the L1 Red Line metro stop is across the street from the hotel and is easily accessible. The rooms are very nice and we really loved the spacious bathroom. The shower was completely over the top!",5,2017,11,16
30,We needed to be early at the Barcelona Airport,"We chose this hotel because we needed to be close to the Barcelona Airport and on the Saturday they had predicted a mass demonstration in Barcelona. Well this hotel was really what we expected from it. Nice and friendly  reception. Nice room with a nice bathroom and a nice wardrobe. Several restaurants but as we were not very hungry , we chose the cafe. The  menu was simple, but nice. We ordered the burgers. The only negative point was that they didn't ask how we wanted our burger to be cooked. So I got a well done burger which was OK for my husband, but I prefer my burger medium rare. The room was super. The breakfast was really super. Actually the best breakfast we have eaten in Europe. And all that at 10 minutes from the Barcelona airport. There is also a shutle  to and from the airport.

When necessary, we will really use this hotel again. ",5,2017,11,14
30,beautiful hotel,the hesperia tower is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous views and clean comfortable rooms. we upgraded to a suite and were able to utilize the concierge floor for evening snacks and drinks and a continental breakfast in the morning; although it would have been nice to take a glass of wine back to our suite instead of having to finish everything in the concierge room.  the complimentary airport shuttle was an added plus. with the hotel being in the middle of a residential area a shuttle into town would have been welcome.,4,2017,11,14
30,Great conference venue,"I had a very comfortable stay here for a conference. The room was a good size and was very clean.

Breakfast offered a fantastic buffet with lots of choice. The only shame is that the water isn't hot enough for making strong English breakfast tea.

It's definitely worth a trip to the Dome bar for spectacular views across Barcelona.",4,2017,11,13
30,Overrated,"Myself and my boyfriend booked this hotel for a joint birthday get away. When we arrived we were offered a room upgrade for 35 euros per night, which we accepted, what a mistake that was. Our ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù room smelt damp, had stains on the carpet and walls and cigarette burns on the sofa. Although the bathroom was clean and the bed also clean and comfortable. On our first night we ate in one of the restaurants; my boyfriends ‚Äútenderloin steak‚Äù was so fatty he could barely eat it and the staff were rude and inattentive. My meal was lovely but for the price payed for the steak, the meal just didn‚Äôt seem worth it. We then moved on to the top floor bar and enjoyed the views and some drinks, it is a really nice bar with good staff.

Twice when I asked reception to call us a taxi, after checking there were none outside, I was told to stand outside and flag one down, bearing in mind that this hotel is not on a main road nor is it in the city centre. A taxi to Ramblas from this hotel costs at least 15 Euro.

Eventually after two average nights my boyfriend went to reception to complain as we requested multiple times that some instant caffeinated coffee was left instead of just decaf, this never happened and after so many other problems we felt we had to say something. He was shrugged off and told it would be dealt with, no one contacted us to see if anything was better or to see if they could do something to improve upon their service.

Upon checking out I wasn‚Äôt even asked how our stay was. I simply payed our bill then left.

I wouldn‚Äôt come back here purely for the amount of small hospitality-based issues that occurred which could have been so easily amended.

30,Good Hotel near Airport,"We decided to book a hotel close to the airport as we had an early flight. We stayed at the Hotel for 2nights and it was worth the money. The rooms are big and the bathroom is beautiful. It was clean and the staff was very friendly, especially Roger from reception. Such a great guy! We did soend a few hours in the Spa which was nice after a day of travelling. However the restaurant was dissapointing for me as I dont like fish or seafood. There was only the option of beef filet which was very nice. However we did go there twice so the second night all i had was a bit of vegetables. The Staff did tell me its a good size and enough as a meal. well it was clearly not as i did go to the gas station after to buy some snacks. The bar in the lobby has nice snacks and more options for people who dont like fish but if you want to go eat something nice better eat in the City.

Overall i was happy with the hotel and it was worth the money.",4,2017,10,22
30,What a wonderful staff and hotel ,"Actually we were forced to stay a night longer in Barcelona since we were completely robbed. Missed our flights, had to file a report for 3!! Houres, completely exhausted and just wanted a place to sleep. So we found this beautiful Hotel. When we arrived, the staff (his name was Roger) was so extraordinary friendly, gave us a Suite upgrade, secured parking and a breakfast for free. Had a delicious dinner at the restaurant and a cava on the house. Really amazing staff- that is actually what you need, after such a terrible day . The view is amazing and we really enjoyed the stay. We will come back. 
Thank you again NH for making our day !!!",5,2017,10,16

I found out I lost my earring when I got back to Australia and the staff at the hotel were most helpful.  They arranged to post it back to me and I have now received it.  My only negative comment is that it's a 25 min into Barcelona city but the metro is excellent so no real problem.,4,2017,10,16
30,Well rested,"If you need a place to stay overnight in Barcelona this is the place. Friendly personnel everywhere you turn in the hotel, helpful and ready to smile. Breakfast was delicious and healthy with a variety of foods that satifys the most. 
The rooms are comfortable and clean with a great pressure shower that will make you feel new after a long flight.
I decided  to stay in and ask for room service for dinner. The service was fast and the food  delicious.
They need a gym, but they give you the option to join the Metropolitan Health Club & Spa which is walking distance across the hotel for 12 euros. Maybe next time.",4,2017,10,13
30,Conference ,"5star..? More like 1
Poor hotel and poor service, nice views but that would be the only reason to stay. Service is is not what you would expect from a 5 star and generally poor. Try staying closer to the centre in a good hotel ",1,2017,10,11
30,Basically a very tall Travel Inn.,"Like the other NH hotel I have reviewed I have to wonder how this establishment was awarded 5 stars. I booked it as it was handy for the airport and I have to admit it was not particularly expensive, but you get what you pay for. This is mainly a conference hotel, and the rooms, while appearing modern and upmarket on first impressions, are really not much better than those of a budget inn. The carpet in our room was filthy and stained. Lots of receptionists but apparently only one porter, and you had to ask for luggage to be brought to the room. Bar prices, etc. are 5 star, of course. On the plus side we ate in the bar area and the two barmen/waiters were excellent - friendly and efficient. Suggest that unless you are looking to stay close to the airport you seek out an alternative hotel if visiting Barcelona.",3,2017,10,11
30,Short but relaxing stay,"So happy to see a Filipino at the Reception, she was so helpful, otherwise we will have a hard time checking in as we don't speak Spanish. They speak English though, but not fluently. 

We arrived in the evening so the very comfortable bed was a welcome delight after a 14-hour flight. The room was very clean and cozy.

The breakfast buffet was excellent which I look forward every morning of our 5-day stay. The Tower Room or the Executive Room has everything you want after a hectic day out.

The location is perfect for it stand tall on a property that was not crowded, a 10 minutes drive from the airport and very near to the subway station.

Given the chance to go back to Spain, I will surely stay in this hotel.    ",5,2017,10,11
30,Frustrating visit - key cards didn't work properly,"Stayed for 8 days in the Suites and found the visiting very frustrating. The room key lock never opened properly, even after trips by maintenance. Requested they move us - they never did - just kept reissuing key cards which inevitably would fail (even management's master key failed at one point). Not the most service oriented. Be aware that the location is not the most convenient. If you're going to a convention at Gran Via Fira it's a change of trains. It an ok location for the airport, but still will have to change trains or take a 20 Euro taxi. Breakfast was ok, rooms are clean. ",3,2017,10,08
30,Son of Terror Attack Victim,"I stayed at this hotel after an emergency journey to Barcelona after I found out my Mother had in been seriously injured in the La Rambla terror attack on 17th August 2017. She was admitted to Bellvitge University Hospital and the nearest hotel was the NH Collection Barcelona Tower so a member of staff from the hospital arranged for me to stay here so I could be close to my mother.

Upon my arrival I was greeted by the Manager Alberto who advised that he had been made aware of the situation with my Mum and told me that if there was anything I needed I should just let him know. This was just the start of the exceptional and truly caring service I received from Alberto throughout my 8 night stay at the NH Collection Barcelona Tower. Other members of staff I must mention who went above and beyond to be on hand during a truly difficult time were Javier in the breakfast restaurant and Diego on reception. I also have to give the biggest thank you to Edwin, the bar manager. After a long day at the hospital, I would come back to the hotel to have something to eat before calling it a night and no matter the time, Edwin would ensure this was possible. Each day I saw him he enquired about how my Mum was with the most genuine concern and was truly such a pleasant person to have around during such a terrible time. Whilst I appreciate my visit was of a unique nature the effort made to accommodate me by all of the staff at NH Collection Barcelona Tower was truly humbling.

The hotel truly deserves its 5 star official rating and I can honestly say that it is better than many 5 star hotels that I have stayed in across the world in regards to both the staff who work here and the facilities they provide (especially the pool and spa area, the restaurants and I must mention the high tech lifts).
 
Although, I spent most of my time in Barcelona at the Hospital when I was in the Hotel I was in awe of how classy it was. The room was contemporary yet luxurious. The bed was extremely comfortable. The shower was similar to a hydro massage shower and was fitting after a long day. The food in the restaurant not only looked stunning but was prepared and cooked to such a high standard. I had the milk fed goat on two occasions and continue to rave to my wife to this day that no other dish I eat will come close. Lastly, one of the selling points the hotel is known for - the dome on the 23rd Floor was not only a sophisticated place to relax after a long day but gives the best views over Barcelona you could wish for.

I also had reasons to visit other parts of the city as my Mum's friend was injured also and was admitted to another hospital in Barcelona. Hospital de Bellvitge Metro Station is only a 2 minute walk away and is served by Line 1 of Barcelona's metro system and will take you to the centre of Barcelona in less than 30minutes. The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to the beach, airport (which I used when returning back to London) and Pla√ßa de Catalunya (the city centre) numerous times a day.
 
I can‚Äôt thank this Hotel enough along with all the staff at Bellvitge Hospital. I have lived in London my whole life and was always sure no city could be so meaningful to me, but the people who I had the opportunity to come into contact with during my 8 nights in the city has changed that.

Unfortunately, my mother remains in hospital to this day as she learns to walk again and readjust to life after the horrific experience she went through. She was repatriated to her home country of France and will be in hospital for at least another few months, but once she has recovered she is devoted to finishing her holiday in Barcelona which I will join her for and there is no other place we plan to stay, but the NH Collection Barcelona Tower.",5,2017,10,06
30,Soviet experiment gone wrong ,"If you are looking for soviet inspired architecture and in room amenities and fittings that were likely installed around the same era, then this is the hotel for you. 

If your idea of an active stay with an 'innovative' hotel gym is toning your glutes walking down an external fire escape or working your finger dexterity by re-entering the wifi password each time you move around your room, then start to limber up for your stay at Hesperia!

On the plus side you won't need to iron your clothes...well because there are not enough irons. Who would have thought a business hotel would need an iron in each room! On the plus side, you can enjoy an in-room steam as you 'iron' your clothes using the hot water from the dribbling shower.

Completely ill-equipped to be a business hotel and cannot quite believe they are allowed to advertise this as a 5 star establishment. Avoid!

(The breakfast is quite good though and the staff do the best they can under some fairly terrible management)",1,2017,10,06
30,Beautiful hotel,Close to airport but a bit out of the way from sight seeing. Room was spectacular though. Bathroom and wardrobe area to die for. Great views from the window and club on the top floor. Only down side was the food and drink was good but very pricey. Wine in Spain is super inexpensive except here. ,5,2017,10,03
30,3 nights in Barcelona,"The NH Barcelona tower hotel was perfect for our city break. Although not in the city centre they have a courtesy shuttle to drop off and pick up from the centre. 
The rooms are bright clean and spacious with large bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and our room had great views over the city.
The tower block has plenty of lifts with automatic cueing so we never had to wait more than an few seconds.
The buffet breakfast was good quality and plentiful.
All of the staff that we had contact with, were helpful courteous and friendly.
We used the Gym and Spa for a supplement of 12‚Ç¨, again a good facility with plenty of different activities.
If I was returning to Barcelona would I stay here again MOST DEFINATELY.",5,2017,10,03
30,Practical,We stayed at this hotel for one night as it is close to the airport. For that purpose it‚Äôs ideal. If you want to visit Barcelona there are much better options close to the city. It‚Äôs a nice hotel and you can use of the health club next door for a small price it‚Äôs not ideal as you have to leave the hotel to get there. It‚Äôs a very nice gym with a big pool sauna ect ,4,2017,10,03
30,Very very gorgeous,"My boyfriend and I, we booked a city break through Voyage Privie, we liked the look of this hotel and due to its high star rating we were very happy to pay the price, we were aware it was outside the city but that was fine. When we eventually arrived at the hotel (metro is not as close as you think via bus from airport), we got checked in by a lady who went through everything with us and gave us our room key. We went to our Superior Double Room with a View. The room was absolutely stunning, the floor had a few marks, but other than that, we really did not have any complaints. The bed was huge, bathroom was gorgeous and the views were lovely, loved the electric curtains! The views day and nights was lovely, all aspects of the hotel were nice, down-side is you need to pay 12 euros a day to use the swimming pool and gym etc a day, not really worth it for an hour or so. 

Breakfast was lovely, it was a buffet with a huge range of food and drinks to choose from and enjoyed the shuttle provided in to the city by the hotel provider. Overall a wonderful experience and would visit for a 5-star luxury visit.",5,2017,10,02
30,"Very nice hotel, awesome restaurant staff","No complaints with this hotel at all, except that it's on the edge of the city, so not close to city centre. In every other way I would recommend it! And a big shout out to Salim and Carlos in the breakfast restaurant - extremely attentive, friendly and helpful!",4,2017,10,02
30,NH Collection Barcelona Tower = Hesperia Tower,"high class hotel at the edge of Barcelona; metro is within 5-7mins walking distance but it takes you at least 25min to Barcelona center; Airport by car 10mins; rooms are very nice designed but should be renovated - especially pretending to be a 5star hotel; staff is very attentive, food is ok; breakfast buffet is big - quality of food could be better; coffee: made by Jura¬Æ machines; in summery: quite far to Barcelona; nothing important in the next surrounding",4,2017,10,01
30,Glad we were only staying the one night,"I booked as the hotel is located half way between the airport and the cruise terminal where we needed to be the next morning. We arrived late and were disappointed by the condition of the lounge and the room. The lounge area soft furnishings were extremely tired and the carpet in our room needed replacing - fraying at the door.
It was an odd room since the entry door takes you through the bathroom before entering the bedroom.
They claim that they provide an American breakfast but that turned out to be fried eggs on a greasy platter and some less than appetising fatty bacon. All the cereals were the sugar loaded cheap variety.
Many of the guests seem to stay there due to the proximity of the hospital and university.
I can't see why any tourists would want to stay there when the taxi fare into the main part of town is e25.
The staff were very pleasant and helpful, but NH need to invest in this hotel if they want to claim its a 4 star.",3,2017,09,29
30,Five stars? I doubt it. ,"Hesperia Tower hotel (NH Collection Barcelona Tower) is said to be a 5-star hotel in Barcelona. But there is a lot the hotel has to do to measure up. We booked a premium room through hotels.com which described the room to have a size of 517 square feet (48 square metres).  The room we were given measured no larger than half the size promised. When we asked at the front desk, we were told that the room given to us was the type of room we reserved. None of the people at the front desk seemed to know the actual sizes of their different room types. The worse was to come. The floor-to-ceiling window in the room has a large crack. It is extremely irresponsible of the hotel to allow the room to be used before repair is done. A window with such a large crack could disintegrate anytime causing injuries to occupants and pedestrians on the street. This was not the only crack in the room. They use a lot of glass and mirrors to give the illusion of being spacious. There was another crack in the mirror wall of the closet. Overall the service attitude of many front desk staff was not friendly and not helpful. I would not recommend this hotel and would never come back. ",2,2017,09,25
30,Weekend break,"My husband and I stayed here for the weekend, hotel reception area was lovely.
Our room was in the 20th floor, room was really nice plenty of room, shower and dressing area were a good size, bed was fantastic so comfy.
Hairdryer was great not the usual hotel type.
Room was spotless, cleaners did a fantastic job
Check in was very slow but check out was quick and easy.
Dome bar had great views at night but service is terrible so only used once.
We only used hotel to sleep never used restaurant for dinner or breakfast wouldn't have paid the breakfast price after hearing other guests comments on it.
We never used the metro, taxi rank out side 15 euros into Las Ramblas.
We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel it was 15/20 euros cheaper than all the transfers getting offered.
",4,2017,09,20
30,"Standard hotel, nothing special but good for a short stay","Stayed here when visiting Barcelona for my stag do. 
It's an OK hotel, nothing special but good for a budget hotel. It suited us well as we simply just wanted somewhere to sleep but not be in a hostel! 
It's a little far out from main Barcelona so you will have to use the metro but you are near the Sants train station, about a 10 minute walk and another 5 minutes to 'Arenas' which has a range of shops and restaurants which are well worth a visit!
The rooms of the hotel are OK, again nothing special but it was clean and the bed comfortable. The staff were very friendly and were happy to help with giving directions, booking taxi's etc. 
I wouldn't suggest paying for breakfast as it really really is not worth it!! The breakfast selection is very basic and defiantly not worth paying extra for. 
If you on a budget and you just need a room, this hotel is fine. If you're happy to spend a little extra, I would suggest staying somewhere else.",3,2017,09,19
30,In the middle of nowhere,"Located half way between the airport and the city centre meant spending most of my time sweating in the back of warm taxis. The roads are always busy. The unique selling point and most attractive part of the hotel is the space ship style roof bar/restaurant however we were told by staff that this has been closed for 5 years. I wouldn't say that the hotel is ideal for city breaks due to the location. Food in the Boutique restaurant was very nice. There is no pool directly in the hotel however you can use the pool next door at a charge. Room was nice but bathroom very dark even with lights on. Great views of industrial estates, docks, university and hospitals",3,2017,09,14
30,A dreadful experience,"Vueling having cancelled our flight to Brussels at the last minute yesterday night, we were sent, after having waited 4 hours at the airport, to this hotel to spend the night before being re-routed to Brussels. 
Well, since the first to the last second in this place we were treated as poorly and cheeply as possible, being openly considered as clients of third category (despite the fact that we were actually victim of an unpleasant situation, with embarrassing professional impact notably). 
Contradictory information, endless waiting time at the reception desk and restaurant, insulting behaviour from the personnel in the restaurant, refusal to benefit from the room service - that we of course intended to pay ""Sorry, you are not normal clients"" (?!!), awful food proposed (dry bread, water and lettuce with no dressing and a few grammes of thuna from a can, followed by dry chicken half cooked and a oily cold patato). All lacks were attributed to the flight company, vehemently criticised. 
Well, we experienced ourselfes recently the poor services from Vueling, and all related inconvenients. 
But, in your h√¥tel, our expectation was not to receive a 5 star treatment but just to spend a peaceful moment and receive a decent service. 
Shame on you...",1,2017,09,11
30,Short stay ,"We booked this hotel for one night since we needed a place in between the flights. Hotel was a solid 4. Big rooms,  nice bathrooms and clean. Spain is ripping off all the tourists so was glad that they did not charge me for the bottle of water we took from mini bar (kind lady at repetition just smiled and waived the fee). If you plan to use it for the transfer night take a bus from the airport (we came late and used the night bus N17 departing from the bus station just in from of the terminal). We paid 2.15 for the ticket and arrived 800 meters from the hotel while the fixed taxi fee was 40 Euros!!!! For 8 minutes trip. ",4,2017,09,11
30,Amazing!,"Honestly could not rate this hotel high enough. The staff did everything possible to make sure that my boyfriend and I had the most comfortable and satisfying stay. We had a 'tower club' card which gained us entry to a room that had endless amounts of alcoholic and soft beverages, as well as snacks such as fruit and muffins (which I would definitely recommend getting). Although we thought that the pool would be located in the hotel it was actually outside the building, and you had to pay for that separately to gain access. However, overall the hotel was amazing and we will definitely be staying with them again on our next trip. The hotel also offered a free shuttle bus that took you to the main destinations in Barcelona, as well as the airport.",5,2017,09,10
30,Bad experience ,"We booked through getaroom.com a superior room with flex breakfast package that said in room description that it would be in the 14 to 22 floor when we checked in we were given room 715 and they said the website had the description wrong. The room shower glass is was leaking from under and wet the whole bathroom we called and told them and they did nothing about it. We expected much more since we payed more for our room type. The breakfast was great. They gave us club access as a sorry(we were supposed to get that any way as part of our package) 
The club was pretty nice. Overall it was disappointing how they handled the mistake. Its far from downtown but super close to subway station. ",1,2017,09,07
30,Great City Break,"Lovely room, clean and spacious, great service and friendly staff - the hotel is located very close to a metro station to get you in and out of town easily and there are some good coffee bars and a bakery behind the hotel too :) 
",5,2017,09,05
30,Mrs,"My husband and I booked 4 nights at Hesperia Tower, August 15 to 19. After I booked the hotel, I called to make sure there is a shuttle that would be available from the airport to the hotel and I was assured that there will be one available every hour. That was not the case! Come to find out, there was a specific schedule and we missed the shuttle somehow, even though we were at the right spot (T1) and right time to take it. The next one available was not due for another 5 hours! After travelling for 10 hours with lots of luggage,  that is not what we wanted to hear. But we took a taxi and finally arrived. The checking in process was fast and friendly and they did try to apologize for the shuttle inconvenience by offering us a free breakfast for the following day. Finally, in our room and we find out that our mini fridge does not work. Called about 4 times to try to have it repaired and/or replaced, but nothing happened during our stay. The hotel settled for sending us ice, but even that was on a one hour delay. In the bathroom, the mirror was broken next to the shower stall and that was giving off not such a pleasant smell in the entire room. It was brought up to the attention of the service desk a few times and they sent the cleaning lady to clean that area, but the smell was fixed just temporarily.
This hotel does not have a pool and gym. There is a pool and gym close by, but you have to walk out of the hotel to go next door and pay to gain access to both.

All in all, I would not recommend a stay at this hotel for longer than one night.",2,2017,08,31
30,Fallen star,"This may be an over critical review as I stayed here almost 9 years ago. At the time, it was ahead of its time, striking architecture, modern design and it seems to have stood still. Other less starred hotels  nearby have overtaken it. Also the general maintenance leaves a bit to be desired. My power shower almost came off the wall, worked fine but not what you would expect. The lobby wc just smelled. Service was great had it not been for the comparison, this hotel would have scores better in my mind. ",3,2017,08,29
30,Amazing stay at hotel; I will book again next time I am in Barcelona,I was on business when I stayed at this hotel.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  The hotel was well appointed and the room was an excellent size.  The food was great.  The room service was very efficient.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and will definitely book here the next time I am in Barcelona. ,5,2017,08,28
30,"Good hotel little far from Barcelona Center, not for children","NH Collection Tower is locally known as Hesperia Tower. A good 5 star hotel that does the job what it says. It is not in Central Barcelona and you will need Bus or metro to reach Barcelona town which takes about 30 minutes but you get a bus or metro. Taxi's were seen all the time. The hotel offers Shuttle Bus to airport or Barcelona however the time is not frequent and often odd. Room was not that big but had all the required amenities and was clean and nice. Pillows were not conventional. Glass-fitted bath room was a complete room and was wonderful. We enjoyed home like luxurious bath and facilities. Staffs are responsive and good. 

What disappointed us more was the facilities like swimming pool, gym and spa. the hotel owns non-of them but refers the guests to Metropolitan Club at the rate of Eur 12 per person per day. This club is next building to the hotel but this doesn't motivate to use the facilities. In my case it was absolutely not possible because the club doesn't allow children and we book this hotel  just for my 9 years old son. So we couldn't use any facility. We should have been told this via Expedia at the time of booking. Hiding this information on the website was something bad we didn't appreciate. 

We wanted to check out 1 hour later seeing some telephones coming and normally it has never been a problem but this hotel didn't show any flexibility and that is another negative point. 
However I would recommend to go to this hotel but not for family.  

Bath room, hotel itself. The terrace and upper floors are not open for everyone so don't get excited.

Please give information on the website that children are not permitted in swimming pool, gym and that these do not belong you but you.",4,2017,08,24
30,Five star price but not a five star experience.,"The hotel is much further out of the centre than I realised, I clearly should have checked but perhaps it should be made a bit clearer. However my main issue was the room was tired, old and dirty. Stains on the carpet, cracked glass in the bathroom. If I was feeling generous I'd say it was an OK hotel that needs some work but then again I'm not convinced, the management need to understand that clean rooms are a basic and get better from there. ",2,2017,08,21
30,Nice large room,"Stayed here for a conference at the hotel. The room was spacious, the bed was very large and comfortable, and the temperature could be controlled to suit. Nice shower facilities, with complimentary toiletries. The only negative was a lack of water in the room, unless you wanted to buy from the minibar. 
The bar was nice, as was the breakfast. All the staff were friendly and helpful. 
Good location near to the airport for business. ",4,2017,08,20
30,Recommend the suite!,"We stayed here on our last night in Barcelona before heading to the airport. We spent the first three nights in an Airbnb in the heart of the Gothic quarter/Born without air conditioning, so this was our splurge night to be close to the airport. I booked a suite after seeing impressive photos and reviews and am so glad I did! The price difference was minimal and we felt like royalty.

The suite was great! It was on the 25th floor and had two levels: a living room space with a half bath on the first and the bedroom, full bath, and jacuzzi bathtub on the second. There were large, skylight-angled windows that overlooked the city when the blinds were up, making for a great view. The shower was very good, the bed was large and comfortable, and it was so relaxing to take a bubble bath before climbing into bed.

There were only two negatives to this hotel. First was that it's isolated from restaurants and bars that you might want to venture to in close walking distance. We were tired and I was recovering from a stomach bug, so we just ate in the hotel restaurant, which was fine enough. Second was the check in process. We got there early and our room wasn't yet ready‚Äîno problem, we knew it could be the case. So we ventured out and did some sightseeing before returning at the normal check in time. Our room was still not ready and we were told it would be 15 mins. We waited and waited until nearly 45 mins had gone by. Apparently they had forgotten about us because our room was indeed ready by that time. They were apologetic and gave us access to the club room. Not a big deal overall, thus only dropping one star.",4,2017,08,17
30,Great stay before flying out,I found the hotel on Trip Advisor but I wasn't totally sure what to expect. I wanted a hotel that included breakfast and free transport to the airport for after our cruise.  I was surprised by how elegant the hotel was.  The breakfast was the best we had on our entire trip. I was very excited about the local foods they featured. Our room was very roomy and well appointed. I loved the shower! My favorite part was the incredible view from our 18th floor room.  I would certainly stay here for our next visit.  Big tip is to eat at the bar for your dinner instead of the restaurant. It is a little less expensive and has great food and service. It was the perfect end to our vacation.,5,2017,08,16
30,Great stay coming into Barcelona,"We stayed at NH Collection Barcelona after coming in late on a long-haul flight, and found that it was a great introduction to Barcelona. The Hotel was close to the airport,  and the entrance and ground floor area, very contemporary, well designed, with a great atmosphere. Our room had commanding views over the surrounding area and provided a great nights sleep. We were really just using the hotel as a transit stop as were picking up a car in the city the next day and driving along the top of Spain to Santiago. Still, we found the beds extremely comfortable and the bathroom well thought out.  the hotel was close to the metro and we had no trouble getting into the city. While brief, all in all the stay was memorable and would certainly recommend.",4,2017,08,16
30,Baggage theft right in front of the entrance,"The hotel itself is ok, the rooms are pretty dark and that depends on the taste of the individual. Much worse is the theft of luggage right in front of the hotel entrance. That is also the reason for this negative review. The security staff were not at all helpful in trying to solve the crime, aperently nothing was to be seen on the security camera that should have hadf a clear view of the happening. This makes me wonder wether the hotel staff might have benn involved!?? Also no answer was received on subsequent email contact requesting a update on the investigation and also the request for a copy of the invoice. Very bad service indeed!",1,2017,08,15
30,"The location is excellent, and free parking is possible in front of the hotel","Reception staff at the hotel are very friendly and welcoming
The rooms are very clean and well equipped, and the bed is very comfortable
Breakfast is very luxurious and rich with a wide selection of quality food
The hotel is close to any attraction in Barcelona as well as the airport
Very simple, it is worth it and recommended to stay there
Luxury shower room with luxury toiletries",4,2017,08,13
30,Disappointed,"My husband and I stayed here at the end of a holiday as it was close to the airport. Very flashy when you first walk in but on closer inspection in hallways and rooms, stains on carpets, some light globes not working in room and no tea/coffee ficilities. We decided to go for a swim in the pool, as seen in the facilities on trip advisor. However we were told it is next door, you needed a pass and it was 12 Euro's each to use.  No mention of this on Trip adviser ad. Also we had no water in our room when we arrived in the shower or basin.I rang the desk and they said someone would come up. Didn't see anyone but a while after hubby tried the water again and it was back on. Know one had told us. Feeling a bit down hearted by now. Went for a walk and found an alley of small shops, cafes and bakeries. Good value here. Better option than expensive restaurants at hotel. Breakfast there was 22 euro or I think 18 if you paid at desk before hand. Still too dear and as I am a Celiac I couldn't eat half of it.On the up side we had dinner at one of the restaurants, only one was open. The meal and service there was very good. My husband said one of the best steaks he'd ever had and my cod fish was beautiful also. They even had gluten free bread for me. As I said the service in there was excellent. They have shuttle busses to airport, Barcelona or Gava beach, just out of Barcellona. We chose the latter for our last day. We walked down quite a way along the beach and found a couple of bar/cafes on the beach. We stopped at the second one and stayed all day. All painted white with a few potted plants. It was beautiful, relaxing and the service very friendly. We hired 2 sunbeds and an umbrella and just chilled out. It was a perfect way to end our holiday. So glad we did that. Not much to do around the hotel, mainly industrial. There is a small park behind the hotel where lots of locals walk dogs in the evening. We enjoyed a walk there also. Pictures are of Gava beach about 15/20 minutes away, not near hotel.",3,2017,08,12
30,would retrun,"perfect venue for a one night business trip stay. rooms are spacious, large bathrooms, room service breakfast not the best I've ever had but was ok. not a great selection of gin & tonics at the bar. staff were pleasant. good location for my office, but not that close to Barcelona city centre.",4,2017,08,10
30,Lovely stay,"Although this hotel is out of the city, it is easy to access Barcelona's main attractions via the metro (it takes about 25 mins max). The service we received was excellent, in particular from Ali who gave superb room service and was a great ambassador for NH hotels. The rooms are outstanding. The shower is superb and the views of the city are amazing (you can spot Camp Nou, La Sagrada Familia and Barcelona Cathedral from room 22!). Breakfast is lovely but very pricey (about ‚Ç¨25 per person), so we went down to the local shop for pastries the next day. Air con does what it says on the tin and provides a welcome respite from the heat of the city. We did not use the spa facilities so cannot comment on them, but overall our stay was definitely five star. Gracias!!",5,2017,08,09
30,A towering success,"I would definitely recommend this place to stay for a weekend, as it's quite expensive but luxurious. It's good value, though, because it's a little way out of town, and there's no way any 'normal' people could afford this luxury IN town!!

Great views if you stay from say the 15th floor upwards  - try to get a room on one of the higher floors, facing the city. You can see a lot of it through your window!

Now for some important tips to make the most of your stay:

Get from the hotel the departure times and location of the free shuttle bus to the hotel from the airport, otherwise you may have to use a combination of metro, bus or taxi to finally get to the hotel.

Get a higher floor, as I say, for a better view, and make sure it's a view of Barcelona city.

Use the free shuttle bus to the city and back every day, but get in the queue early as there are only 12 seats available.

Have breakfast in Barcelona, not in the hotel, unless you want to pay 25 euros per person each time!

There is a spa for over-18s. I went with my young daughter so we couldn't use it.

Used as a luxurious base for exploring Barcelona and then getting away for a peaceful night, it would be hard to beat this place!

And great showers, if you're a connoisseur of showers!",5,2017,08,09
30,Lovely Hotel But...,"This hotel is located out of the main town which is what we wanted; half way between the Airport and the Centre of Barcelona. The hotel runs a free irregular bus service to and from the town, beach and airport. Be careful to check the bus schedule on-line as it changes with seasons as we found out, having printed the schedule out in April it was one hour out when we arrived at the airport in August. If there is no free bus available there is a nearby Metro Station in the University Hospital opposite the hotel and also Taxis are usually available at the front of the hotel and only cost 15Euros for a 20 minute journey into town (as of 08 Aug 2017). 

If you want to do the tourist thing in town then could I suggest staying at one of the many sister NH Collection Hotels within the town centre area which seem to have the same level of quality facilities.

Our hotel was 26 stories high and we were roomed on the 15th floor with panoramic views of the surrounding urbanised area. The rooms are spacious with large bathroom and wardrobe area. To give it a perspective the rooms are much better than the regular Holiday Inn experiences we have had in the UK, and better than an than their executive rooms. We were not affected by any noise in our room from neighbours.

The staff are excellent and very helpful. The Concierge, Luis, was very helpful in booking a restaurant for us on the beach for a special occasion. It was a superb choice (called Carpe Dium Restaurant), a bit expensive but well worth it.

The breakfast in the hotel is expensive (26Euros each) so we opted to use a nearby caf√© (Caf√© 365) in the local shopping precinct towards the back of the hotel (about 3 minutes walk).

The Pool, Gym and Spa facilities are separate from the hotel and cost an extra 12Euros per day, per person. We only used it once as we were busy elsewhere the rest of the time. The pool is half Olympic size with sun-loungers outside on a paved patio area. Spa treatments are extra as is to be expected but these were fully booked so we did not use them. I suggest booking before you arrive is the best option. There are no spa treatments on a Sunday.

If I was to be finicky about the experience I would say that the furnishings in the room look a bit worn and need to be replaced, particularly the carpet and curtains plus the settee in our room which had rips in it. Don't let that upset you as everything else was as we had expected for a 5-star hotel.

I hope enjoy it as much as we did.",4,2017,08,09
30,Wonderful discovery,Walking distance to subway station Hospitalet de Lobregat. Value for money. Cheap Shopping area behind. Twenty minutes from old city core. Shuttle to city and beach quite well organized. Buy your water outside.,5,2017,08,08
30,Good stay and good Location ,"The hotel at first impression is lovely with spacious rooms and bathrooms. The staff checked us in very quickly and the hotel was greatly air conditioned. 

Our hairdryer broken and was replaced really quickly after we informed reception, the kettle also blew the electric which was sorted almost straight away. 

They could provide more than one coffee in the room but other than that the cleaners, mini bar and view of the Barcelona are all amazing. The beds are large and comfy with a large TV and couch. 

The hotel is a little away from the centre and beaches you can get the free shuttle bus however the seats are limited so you have to make sure you get there early. There are little shops and food places are the hotel and close to a metro station. Be warned the metro stations are very hot and humid with the stop being the very last. Taxis are around 10-15 Euro home from Barcelona so be careful what you are charged taxi is the best way around. If you go to the beach go to Gava beach it's much nicer. 

Overall great stay and would recommend for a great price!! ",4,2017,08,08
30,Not as it is on the cover,Booked through British Airways as a package. Wanted a hotel with pool for my son and I and wanted to eat in the dome. Got there the dome has been shut for 4 years and kids under 16 not allowed in pool,3,2017,08,08
30,Nice hotel,"The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly, check in was very simply with plenty of information given on bus times and the Metro stations etc.
The room was very clean and spacious, the view we had was of Barcelona city and was amazing. The bathroom was massive with plenty of mirrors and storage, the shower was very good with a few different settings.
Would happily go back when staying in Barcelona.",4,2017,08,08
30,Great location for business,"Stayed at this hotel for four days in May, for a conference. 

10 min. by taxi from the airport (there is also a shuttle service but running hours are not always convenient). 

Very professional staff, friendly and efficient.

The hotel has large meeting/conference rooms and all commodities you expect from this type of hotel. 

Great breakfast buffet. 

Rooms are spacious, clean and the bathroom is a good size. 

I am not sure if this hotel is ideal for a tourist who wants to visit the city as its location is outside the city Centre. 
Nevertheless I can recommend the hotel and would probably stay here again.",4,2017,08,03
30,First time Barcelona ,"Fantastic location . Room excellent . Staff nice , but not overly , which we like on holiday. Roof terrace lovely , drinks pricey with only 2 choices of wine , and don't think can buy a bottle. Roof terrace pool opens at 10am , but wasn't for some reason ?? Didn't make a fuss though ",4,2017,08,02
30,What a pleasant week,"Our Junior suite at 24th floor with amazing wiew was great. Also lowed the Tower Club lounge. Nice place to relax after hot day in the sun. Overall the hotel was very good. Atmosphere was excellent. It really looks that the staff were there for you. Great service. 
Breakfast was great. Good selection of everything. Just ask and you get special coffee or omelette. 
Location is out of the centre, but we knew that advance. Easy access to Metro or using hotel shuttle bus and centre can be reached in 20 minutes. 
Ask the higher floor rooms and city view side. ",5,2017,07,26
30,Absolutely adored this hotel!,"We arrived at this hotel after staying at a campsite for a music festival and thank goodness we did! What a feeling it was to arrive at such a beautiful, immaculate place. We arrived earlier than check in, at around 12:30pm, and expected to just spend the day at the pool/bar for some snacks waiting around for our room but the receptionist informed us our room was ready already, which was fantastic news!! I had made my booking for two nights separately as I couldn't find the two nights online anywhere and was anxious we wouldn't be able to stay in the same room for the two nights, but the gent at reception (tall, blonde male) accommodated us perfectly and had it all sorted out within minutes. We had our friends with us who were due to travel back to Scotland that evening on a later flight, and when we asked if we could have them spend the day at the pool with us this wasn't a problem, totally accommodating with them even when they weren't guests at the hotel - they did have to pay the extra ‚Ç¨12 each for this but the spa is definitely worth that! The hotel also allowed them to get the free transfer to the airport (as long as there was space after guests had gotten in it, which is totally understandable) and this just made their last day so much easier. They were so grateful for all of the receptionists help. My boyfriend and I had room service the first night as we were knackered, and because we had the duplex suite it was lovely to just sit in our bathrobes with a gorgeous meal, bottle of prosecco and a STUNNING view of Barcelona right from our suite living area. We couldn't have wished for a better service from the gent who delivered our food, and the hot box under the table to keep our food perfect temperature was an added element to making our first night so lovely. The table was set lovely and was just what we needed. The room was to die for as well, as we walked in we all gasped with a great reaction and felt so happy we were here for the next two nights. The jacuzzi upstairs in the bedroom viewing Barcelonas stunning skyline was just the icing on the cake. Reception the following day were fab, Laura spoke fantastic English and helped us with advice of how to get to sagrada familia - using the metro service just 5 minutes walk away from the hotel - fantastic! So easy to use as well with the t-10 ticket which two of us could use for up to 10 journeys for the next couple of days, all for ‚Ç¨10! After our day of sight seeing we decided to stay local at the hotel again and eat here. This time we got ready and ventured to the restaurant and my goodness was this amazing!!! Edwin was fantastic, what a pleasure it was to have him to look after us. Service was fantastic - totally 5 star, if not better! We had booked for 10pm, and I did feel like a pest to arrive so late, but as soon as we arrived at the restaurant we were welcomed with open arms and made to feel very important to the waiters and again so looked after. The meal was again stunning, food was to die for! The teriyaki pork was just out of this world I loved every mouthful, my boyfriend had the razorfish risotto and he also loved it. We really wish our stay didn't have to end, the whole experience was amazing!! We had access to the tower club as well which was just such a fabulous bonus. I had initially bought this stay as a birthday present for my boyfriend, but I enjoyed it just as much as he did and felt like we had both received a fantastic gift staying here. We would 110% stay here again if visiting Barcelona, easy access to the airport with the free shuttle bus and town, taxis aren't even too expensive to get into the busier part of the city - and again the metro is a superb option just 5 minutes away. There is a shuttle bus service for different places like the beach and different parts of the city but we didn't have a chance to use this: The only negative thing is maybe the carpets need a wee revamp, but everything else is a definite 5 star standard. Thank you for an amazing last few nights to our trip! We will definitely return one day! Lia Keown",5,2017,07,25
30,Disappointed.,"To start off, this is a beautifully designed hotel and it most definitely looks 5 star from the lobby to the room, but i did feel somewhat disappointed with my stay. We were given a room on the 17th room. Our first impressions were excellent, the bed is huge and very comfy, the bathroom is spacious and amazing, the shower was brilliant. But the room was not maintained at 5 stars at all. Hinges on cupboard were broken, wood was peeling away from the dressing table... We used all the 6 hangers we received instantly as there was two of us, i stayed in a hostel earlier in the year and even that gave us extra hangers... 

One of the biggest disappointments i had with my room was the fact there were two lines either side of the bed up the wall. Pencil or pealing away wallpaper? I'm unsure, but there were numerous messy screw holes either side and the wallpaper looked damp and stained towards the bottom. The electric curtain system didn't work at all, this would have been lovely to use in the morning as it was always sunny, i could hear the room next door using it fine. I also noticed that for some reason every other room on the floor had a peep hole on their door but ours for some reason didn't? I feel perhaps every room isn't in this state but we were definitely given the scrags... Not what i expect from a hotel rated 5 stars.
We only had breakfast on the first day but 22 euros each is absolutely ridiculous, it was not enjoyable at all especially when in the centre of Barcelona you can pick up and full cooked breakfast for less that half the cost. Speaking of the centre of Barcelona, getting there is a fair trip. I enjoyed using the shuttle bus, but it has only 13 seats, strange for such a large hotel, we often found there were too many people to fit and twice had to pay for a taxi instead. The bus is regular but the times are a little awkward, the last bus back is 8:20pm, most people in Barcelona don't start eating until after this time, so you'll end up using taxis a lot, unless youre happy to sit on the metro until the very last stop, the metro in Barcelona has very poor air conditioning and it just makes for a very long, hot, uncomfortable journey.

As a round up, I did find the hotel comfortable and enjoyed my stay. But i was left disappointed by too many things to justify me ever stopping here again or recommending this hotel to anyone.",3,2017,07,25
30,Superb!!!!!,It's a little bit of an old fashioned interior because of all the dark colours. But boy did I enjoyed my stay. Very nice rooms. Marvelous bathrooms. Superb breakfast. Late checkout at 12am. Superb coctails and great snacks in the bar. 2 minute walk from the metro. Really a great experience.,5,2017,07,23
30,Beautiful Hotel and excellent service,"We arrived at Hesperia hotel about 15-20 minutes after leaving the airport so its very close to El Prat airport. On arriving the hotel looks very high end and swanky and the rooms as well didn't disappoint. The photos of the room are exactly what they are like in real life and it was modern, comfortable and high end (shower, button controlled curtains, high end looking bathroom and ultra comfortable bed). If I were to visit Barcelona again, I'd definitely stay at one of these hotels (Hesperia Group). 

The only downside is that the hotel is far from the main part of the city (about 15-20 minute drive), so if you are on a deadline you will need to use taxi's. Aside from that, service is fantastic and I they even left me a slice of fancy chocolate cake to celebrate my birthday",4,2017,07,19
30,Too far from city center - family perspective ,"The only reason for two star is is distance from city centre, otherwise service was great, especially Laura had always sincere smile on her face.  They also helped us in every possible way. My only complaint was it was far away from city centre and it took 45 to 60 minutes for us to leave hotel and arrive in city centre.

I was travelling with 3 years old baby with pram, so that is the reason it took so long. 

One last thing if anyone traveling with a baby, keep in mind that sometimes you have to walk quite a distance to change underground lines, which sometimes involves climbing set of many stairs and long walks, which can be really tiring and frustrating at times. Otherwise underground very cheap. Best way to get a t10 ticket.

Overall very good hotel but quite far from city center. ",2,2017,07,19
30,PERFECT!!,"Me and my boyfriend have just come back from a 4 night city break in Barcelona for my birthday. Seeing pictures prior to our visit and reading reviews, we had high expectations for this hotel, and i was not let down one bit. It was absolutely perfect, we paid slightly more for a luxury room on the 25th floor and it was totally worth it. The views where incredible, we had a huge lounge as you walk in and then up the stairs was the bedroom with a jacuzzi bath tub with a view, it was simply perfect. Best hotel i have ever stayed in!! Brilliant restaurant as well, small portions and a little pricey but would defiantly recommend. I was also very surprised to return to our room after a day out on my birthday the hotel had given me a cake and a candle which i thought was lovely and really made me feel special. I could not fault this hotel one bit, i would return to this hotel again and again it was simply perfect. 
10 minuet drive to the hotel from the airport which is great, it is a little out of the city but there is a metro across the road which we used everyday and got to all the main attractions by using this. All in all it was a brilliant stay in Barcelona :)",5,2017,07,17
30,Trip to Barcelona ,"So I put 1 star to grab your attention nobody reads it otherwise. This hotel was nice and all don't get me wrong the people were kinda nice they were mostly just doing there job. Arrived at like 2 in the afternoon told room wouldn't be ready till three asked at three they said still not ready they were about to downgrade me for a room I paid for I was like no. Anyways waiting till like 3:30 to get the room it was nice smaller than I expected but still nice view was on the side of the hotel where you can't see anything the other side is nice. But the thing about this hotel that really errkked me was nothing is complimentary and I mean nothing you gotta pay for everything. Breakfast, the pool gym water. We used it still but the breakfast was kinda expensive and not really worth it. I do highly recommend the dinner though the steak they have there is really good still super expensive though.",1,2017,07,14
30,Luxury hotel inconveniently located,"Unusual post-modern architecture and what appears to be a UFO on the rooftop make this hotel distinctive looking. Very good service, clean, large and comfortable room. The onsite Bouquet restaurant is excellent, as is the breakfast buffet. The only real downside is the location, 20 minutes drive to Plaza Catalunya.",4,2017,07,09
30,Review ,"We stayed in this hotel from 3rd to 7th July 2017, we arrived in the morning and the hotel had a pleasant fragrance the lady ( staff) at the reception greeted us and checked us in. Not much information was given about the facilities in this hotel and breakfast and rates and the restaurant. We got checked in and made our way to the room with little information. Luckily for myself I read plenty of reviews about the hotel on trip advisor by other visitors . The reviews were mixed some were fantastic and some were awful. I remember walking to the room in the hall the carpet was dirty and I remembered a review on the trip advisor saying that the carpet isn't clean and scruffy and not up to five star standard, it reinforced the review was correct. The sofa was not clean either. Another review recently said the telephone in the room doesn't work therefore you cannot call the receptionist the telephone in our room did not work either the curtains are said to be electronic and close and open by a button but those buttons did not work either. The drinks in the fridge are charged at coco cola for 4 euros and chocolate bars for 4 euro each therefore don't touch them because the staff cleaners check the fridge every day when you are out when they come to clean the room and do the bedding, and the charge will get put onto your total bill at the end of the stay. For a five star hotel they should have some teas and drinks in the hotel room for you to access even a 3 star hotel or bog standard travel lodge in the UK offer some tea and biscuits. We didn't use the hand washes and toiletries ( as we thought we would probably get charged  as the hotel seem very stingy with their supplies as read by previous reviews and number two we had prepared with our own toiletries  based on the reviews, we didn't get charged for the toiletries in the end but the hotel are stingy so we didn't take the risk. Breakfast here is 28 euros if you turn up in the morning on floor four, however if you reserve the night before you get it at a discounted rate of 23 euros per person. It is very expensive for breakfast but the breakfast is fantastic and you stay full till six o'clock in the evening if you are travelling the depths and breaths of barcelona as we did use the metro and taxis. 

The staff at breakfast were delightful and very nice and offered tea and drinks everyday which was a nice touch. 

One night we decided to go the restaurant in the hotel floor 2, and before I went to the restaurant I went to the reception to check( as the telephone in our room didn't work )  with the staff if we can just turn up to the hotel or we have to book in advance she said you can turn up. The que in the reception was very long and I had to wait 15 minutes to speak to staff as there was only one or two staff members and when you did get to speak to the staff and get them to deal with your query mid way another colleague would speak to them or they would pick up a phone call and completely ignore you and not apologise for the wait and it was very rude the staff at reception are not overly welcoming and you just want to get your queries sorted and make your way back.  Turned up to the restaurant  and told it was fully booked which wasted my time and got seated at the bar for half an hour and no one acknowledging us there was only two staff on duty and we waited ages to be served. Once we got seated at a table we then had to wait another half an hour for a menu to be given to us. ( common practice when you seat guests you hand them the menu but doesn't seem so at this establishment )After that we waited another half an hour to be served, and then when we did get served it was after half an hour our food was brought out to us.  At one point we thought shall we just walk out because it was that ridiculous we arrived before some of the other customers and they got served before us and seated even though there was a Same number of them as us. Which was poor service. We ordered mocktails and desserts 2 mocktails ( non alcoholic)  and 2 desserts came up to 39 euros. Though the strawberry cheesecake and ice cream was very lovely and the drinks were nice too. Overall decided not to visit the hotel restaurant again as service was very bad. Though I appreciate the efforts of the one staff at the front who was on his own with a fully booked restaurant he tried his best to seat all customers, however as a hotel this is very poor from a what is called a five star hotel. 
Another night I went to reserve breakfast for the next morning and again had to wait for a very long time just to get seen at the reception and people ( other hotel customers ) pushed into the waiting line and are rude and don't see that there is a line and I was waiting before them. I found that generally the reception area is under staffed and staff that are there are not friendly. The lady who I tried to get my breakfast reserved the night before said the computer system slowed down and crashed and she wasn't dealing with my request calmly and seemed rush mid way she picked up the hotel phone answering customer queries without consulting me or apologising in the conversation and dismissed me I waited for her to finish her call and then she was flustered after waiting for ages and long lines of customers waiting behind me and said sorry the computer is locked I can put a note on and send you the bill through your door tonight ( which I agreed on ) as I did not want to waste my last evening in the hotel reception. 

We visited to explore Barcelona and was attracted to the price and package of 240 per per person flight and package for four nights for a five star was good. Wouldn't call this hotel five star. But the bathroom is very nice and is calming. 
Although on the last day the hotel and the bathroom smelt awful and it smelt like sewer work throughout the hotel which was very off putting. The bathroom is cleaned daily and the bed is made everyday when we are out which is great. The air con is great only European channels on the tv which isn't great for five star. 
If you have long curly frizzy hair like me and my sis make sure you take your hair dryer as we thought there will be one in the hotel it's a five star hotel surely they'll have a decent hair dryer. But it was a metal hair dryer which only had one setting and old fashioned one which you had to hold down the button for it to work. Now if u have long thick hair drying on one low setting where you can't even feel the heat on your head you will spend ages drying your hair. Forget about styling it . We left our hair dyer at home don't make that mistake. Very poor hair dryer for a five star hotel even my local gym has better hair dryers which are also ghd and that is not a five star type of gym.  There's not much in the area of the hotel it's a minute walk from the metro when we first arrived asked the staff where the metro she said its outside in an abrupt manner. Outside can mean anywhere, she didn't give directions or seem interested. So when we went out we found it ourselves nor did she tell us what type of ticket to buy. I read reviews on trip advisor on getting a t-10 ticket which gives you ten trips which was perfect and it cost 9.95 euros roughly and it lasted all the time we were here. We got taxis too. 
The taxi to the hotel on arrival charged 20 euros, and on the way back 15 euros. Looks like they try to rip you of if you are foreign and not known to the country. We soon found out the rates in the country and moving from one tourist attraction to another in a taxi would probably cost you 10 euros which is not bad.

We tried to go to park guel twice but tickets get sold out straight away so don't turn up  after ten expecting to go in as they get sold out first forty minutes and the staff there don't explain this well so when we went to visit again the same thing happened which meant a waste of taxi journey and money and most importantly time that could have been spent elsewhere. Tickets to go into park guel is 8 euros.

We also went on the tour bus some of the staff are rude and when we asked them a question he said omg and shoved a map into our hands and walked of.  I let that one go and ignored it. 

Tourist plAces can all be reached on the metro to get into the centre of Barcelona probably takes 20 minutes. You probably don't want to stay in the centre hotels with all the noise and pollution and pick pocketers. I found travelling through out the day and coming back to a nice bathroom and clean bed was a nice transition from hectic city and tourist behaviour and calm evening say the hotel. If you like to relax in the hotel in the evening and put a face mask on and enjoy a long hot shower with the air con on then this is the hotel for you. 

Overall Barcelona is a beautiful country and we met some lovely kind people. 
If you want to stay at this hotel and are touring have the big breakfast it will last you all day and then use metro and taxis to get around only thing is you can't go back to hotel to freshen up without paying 20 euros in taxis or a treck back on the metro. So we left early and returned at 7 everyday and rested in the hotel room as the bathroom was lovely and shower was great.

30,Very plush prepare to pay for extras..,"My son & I stayed at this hotel the night before flying out of Spain. It's a very plush hotel so all the extras-great bed, pillows, spacious rooms & robes too! However, the pool, gym, breakfast & in room snacks are all extra. Airport shuttle is not every hour so we opted to pay the 9 euros for a taxi instead to arrive at the time that was good for our flight. The hotel is very close to the L1 which goes into Barcelona. This was a plus for us. We also discovered a little neighborhood shopping plaza behind the hotel where we found an outside resturant, a pastry shop, fresh fruit stand & grocery. The desk changed USD to Euros for me at the same rate that I found in the city, more than the bank, but the same as the money changing businesses that are convenient & open late. Despite not using the pool or gym, it was a restful stay, which is what we needed.",4,2017,07,04
30,Amazing hotel! ,"Super clean! Excellent staff, location a bit far from downtown, but well connected by metro! It enjoys a beautiful view! Spacious rooms, nice details, city view lifts! Fantastic spa service! One of my favorite hotels! Very beautifull !",5,2017,07,03
30,Lovely short stay ,"Me and my friend visited here for 4 nights and we were welcomed by the most lovely staff. One member helped us massively with directions, places to eat, where to find the metro and enteral concerns we had, he was a delight. Our room couldn't be faulted and was cleaned every day with super comfy beds and the most amazing view to go to sleep looking at and wake up to every morning. 

The hotel shuttle allowed us to go into town for free, and the metro stop was right opposite the hotel for easy access to town and the journey doesn't feel long at all! 

One thing we really missed was just having a pool. We had to go to the beach to catch the sun and missed having a place outside that we could chill in if we wanted to. The food is also very pricy at the hotel. 

Other than that, we had the most wonderful stay and would definitely return for the cost! ",4,2017,07,03
30,Pathetic service ! Business like hotel ,"In a service industry, star rating is not defined by the amenities but the service standards too. 

From the point of check in where we were greeted with an absolutely cold welcome, to rooms that are plush but don't have working telephones to even call the reception, to being send tiny tissues when we asked for a box of facial tissues, there's nothing that seems like it's not a big issue. The design of the toilet is better for couples than families with he class door separating the two areas. And believe it or not the first thing when you enter the room is the toilet then the room! 

If you are here because you want proximity to the airport or purely on business, that's ok.

If not, DO NOT bother. As when we compare this stay with any of our previous stays even at 4 stars, the hotel does even come close to the standards others offer!

See below pics of the phone and facial tissues sent . Mind you both phones don't work! 

",2,2017,07,03
30,Bargain deal for quality standard ,"We stayed here for 4 nights for a city break. On arrival to the hotel, it was plain to see that we had found a real gem! Although a little far out of town, it was definitely worth staying as the metro (hospital de bellvitge) is only over the road and takes about 15 mins to get into the centre. Staff were attentive and helpful.

The room was faultless- very clean and modern. We had a superior room with view and the view certainly was something to behold. 

Would definitely recommend and would stay again if we came back to Barcelona! ",5,2017,07,03
30,The nr.1,"One of the best hotels I stayed in. Today is the sixth night I sleep here and everything is wonderful. The breakfast is fantastic, clean and modern rooms with amazing view, the staff are friendly, specifically Germana, from front office is amazing, 110% professional. Certainly I will recommend this hotel.",5,2017,06,30
30,"5 star, but something is missing.","Very nice rooms, clean. Elegant modern atrium at the entrance. Lot of space for business  conferences.
Gym is missing, there is one just a side but you need to pay 12 eur to get in. Location is ugly, nearby the airport but right in the middle of an industrial district between highways. 15 min taxi from the city center. ",4,2017,06,29
30,Great Hotel,"This is a pretty big hotel and close to the airport. The room is good size, nice and clean, very comfortable. Staffs are very friendly. The breakfast is really good, lot of various. Good quality and quantity.",4,2017,06,29
30,Hesperia Tower Hotel,"First of all let me tell you this is a 5 star hotel for a great price and I hope it stays that way. Let's see: king size beds that are comfortable. Air conditioned, clean, fancy, nice parking though additional - it is worth it! The metro (local subway) is across the street - which will take you anywhere. We took it to the central busy part of town with one train one ride no problems. It's 10 minutes from the airport and they have shuttle service too. ",5,2017,06,28
30,Great Views,"We choose this hotel by the airport even though we were sightseeing in Barcelona for 3 days. they had free shuttle to the city center. The drop off point was in the main shopping district and within walking distance of most attractions. The staff at the city center hotel were very helpful-even though we were not staying at their hotel. The Tower hotel had a great breakfast. Not many choices for food, so be sure to stop and eat in town. Nice clean rooms. the only negative is the upholstery in the bar area is dirty. Fantastic staff. Wee would go there again.",5,2017,06,25
30,Great value city break.,"Stayed in room 1113 for three night stay. Although the hotel is situated nearer the airport, and outside of the centre there are good transport links  to the city, and we chose to buy a 48 hour metro pass, which allows unlimited travel for underground and bus routes and also trams. The room was more than adequate, with comfortable king size bed, twin wash basins, good shower and spacious bathroom. Whilst reading previous reviews I had noticed that the superior room that we had booked does not come equipped with a kettle! Being addicted to tea, I cannot function without three or four cups on awakening in a morning, so took my own kettle and teabags. The hotel restaurant was quite good and we enjoyed a meal there. We are not big breakfast people so skipped breakfast in favour of a light  snack at a local bakery situated just behind the hotel at a cost of about five euros. Compared to the hotel buffet breakfast at 23 euros. Great stay in a wonderful city , without breaking the bank.",5,2017,06,25
30,stay for the food!,"I've stayed at this hotel a few times but this time my plane was delayed, I had car rental issues and ended up arriving after 10pm. with no other option I headed for the hotel restaurant Bouquet (there are more). Not my preferred option to eat at a hotel, when in a nice city, but I wasn't left much choice. And to my surprise, this hotel restaurant is by far the best restaurant I've had a pleasure to enjoy in Barcelona. The service is remarkable, especially Edwin who was serving me on the night, the food is to die for! to say it best - the following day I was waiting for the evening to enjoy my another dinner!

Except for the food the hotel has really attentive staff, offers a paid access to a nearby premium gym with pool - I highly recommend it as well. And there is a metro station within a walking distance - 1 line directly to the Plaza Catalunya.",5,2017,06,23
30,Mr ,"What a fantastic hotel, couldn't believe our luck after getting such a good deal .
We booked for two nights amazing service from the moment we got off the plane,
We got the free shuttle service provided by the hotel took us there in about 10 minutes the driver was very helpful
Told us about all the places we could go to in the area and more places to view further afield.
As we walked into the hotel we were greeted by the friendly staff behind the reception who told us that our room had been upgraded for us as we were on our anniversary, the hotel looks a amazing in every way possible the room was massive ,
With everything you could ask for beautiful shower and dressing area separate from bedroom.Electric closing curtains for the lazy like me.
We dinned in the restaurant on the second evening an had the seven course meal which was amazing as well the waiter couldn't be more helpful with all the questions we were asking about all the different types off food.
Have booked hotel again for same time 2017 . Absolutely flawless place will come here ever year.

Yours thankfully

30,"Amazing, amazing hotel!","I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel! My only regret is that it wasn't longer. The rooms are amazing and spacious. The bathrooms were so lush, what an awesome shower!! The hotel was very clean and the staff very attentive and friendly. The free shuttle bus into down was so handy but there is a metro and buses nearby and taxis too. I will definitely come and stay here again!",5,2017,06,20
30,Birthday treat x,Quite simply the most perfect holiday ever. My boyfriend booked this holiday as a present for my birthday. Little did I know he had requested a special room as a suprise. When we arrived we were shown to our suite.....WOW!! Unfortunately there appeared to already be someone in the room we were initially shown to and when my other half spoke to the receptionist to explain this it was rectified immediately and were found another room 4 floors higher.....even bigger wow!! The stay from start to finish was just fantastic with friendly staff and beautiful views!! Would definately reccommend this hotel to people thinking of visiting this beautiful city. X,5,2017,06,18
30,Good stay but far from city centre,"We booked this hotel because we were attending Sonar music festival and it was convenient for both venues. I would not stay here if I wanted to visit the centre of Barcelona however there is a daily shuttle that goes to the airport and also the city centre. We booked a junior suite but were disappointed with the room. The key did not work and the room was quite small. I spoke with the very helpful Guy on the desk who was called Aire I think. I requested to look at the duplex suite which is two floors. A lounge downstairs and upstairs your bedroom with jacuzzi under the windows looking out over Barcelona. It was a fantastic room with a brilliant shower and amazing air con. The views both during the day and night were spectacular. We found the staff very friendly and helpful particularly Humberto (I think) who had only worked there a few weeks but was brilliant. We only had breakfast one morning which was ok but expensive unless you get it included in room rate. 
We also ate in the Bouquet restaurant which was lovely. My husband loved his steak. 
Taxis are plentiful outside the hotel as it is opposite the hospital and only 10 minutes from the airport.
A good stay. ",4,2017,06,17
30,Deserves 10 stars,"As far as 5 star hotels go, this place is one of the least expensive I've stayed at. The price does not mean the hotel is lacking in anyway though. The rooms are large and spacious. Appointed nicely with all the amenities one would expect from a 5 star hotel. Large shower with good pressure and hot water. Separate bath area from the bedroom which is nice. 

The staff are the real stars here though. Every staff member we encountered was kind and professional without being uptight. All spoke English well and were eager to assist. 

We ate at the restaurant bouquet and we enjoyed it. The bar in the lobby serves food also and we ate there. The bartender was extremely gracious and personable, if not a bit overworked. Lastly the breakfast buffet was wonderful. Many fresh and local options. Worth the money for sure. One of the best stays I've had in awhile. ",5,2017,06,16
30,Great stay!,"We had a wonderfull stay at the NH Collection Tower. Very nice rooms with an amazing shower. I really enjoyed the big fitness area as well. 
The staff was very kind, Roger deserves a special mention for his great help. It would have been nice if the shuttles went more often to the city & airport but even though I would defenitly recommend this hotel to other people!",5,2017,06,15
30,A fab get away hotel!,"So I recently surprised my boyfriend with a trip to Barcelona. We only went for the weekend and the prices were high for everywhere! I had a look on secret hotels with lastminute.com and got a really really great deal for this hotel. If you read the hotel description you can just about figure out which hotel it is if you do a bit of research!

The hotel didn't really look too splendid from the outside however the rooms were really clean and smart. A really comfy stay! We had no complaints at all about the room. The views were also really great. 

The staff were also very friendly and couldn't help us enough upon arrival with where to go and how to get there. 

The hotel is right next to the metro which is such a simple way to get around Barcelona. We got a t-10 ticket which costs 10 euros for 10 journeys and can be used for more than one person! 

The things we should recommend: DO NOT GET A TAXI FROM THE AIRPORT! The fair came to 9 euros but when we stopped he charged us 20 and said that was the minimum fair for airport journeys. On our way back to the airport we were going to get the metro which was 4.50 each however the hotel staff recommended the 46 bus. This was much much quicker and was only 2.15 each! A bargain.

Also don't be fooled by thinking you have free use of the pool and spa. When I booked it said ' possibly charges may occur' what this really means is unless you book a suite it's 12 euros per person to use it! A little disappointing if you ask me. Of course this hotel isn't near the attractions and there really is anything around it however the metro access makes up for it all!

Overall a good stay!

30,Duplex suite ,"Had the pleasure of staying in the duplex suite here and I must say it was amazing. I was happy to pay the lil bit extra for the room because you get all the benefits with it (tower club and gym/spa/pool facilities).

The hotel was nice, food okay. Breakfast good. It was expensive to eat but I found that most of Barcelona was the same.

We couldn't find the shuttle service to the hotel (none of the information desks at the airport knew what we was talking about) so ended up getting a taxi. They charged us ‚Ç¨20 from the airport which I didn't think was too bad as most the reviews were saying ‚Ç¨25min, but If you choose to get a taxi back to the airport, I would check the price prior to leaving as the taxi back to the airport charged us a whopping ‚Ç¨30 for the 5min drive! We felt totally ripped off!

In all I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel, reception staff were very helpful. But if you do want to do all the regular touristy things then I would stay closer to the centre.",4,2017,06,10
30,Wonderful stay at NH Barcelone,"I was received by a very friendly and helpful gentlemen who resolved a booking glitch quickly for me. There were excellent facilities and a good breakfast with many choices. Had dinners as well accompanied by good wine. The rooms were comfortable. The only problem, is the distance from shops for emergency stuff. Not a big problem if one wants sight seeing as there is efficient public transport. On a lighter note the bar is a bit pricy - especially water - but one can just get their own water. Or drink from the tap :)",5,2017,06,01
30,Good hotel,"Good hotel, good facilities, and friendly and efficient staff.
Location is fine for meetings, close to the airport. Good connection by metro to the center of the city.
In summary, this is the good place to stay.",4,2017,05,31
30,Barcelona,everything was good except the room was unfortunately dark. Food and Drinks are great. With a room in the upper Levels you will have a great view around Barcelona City. Bed and infrastructure are modern and best in class.,4,2017,05,29
30,7 Star Hotel- Amazing experience!,It was everything I could ever hope for in a hotel. We stayed in a Deluxe Suite.  I want to model my bedroom at home after this room.  Was a very calm atmosphere that made me so relaxed. Top-notch hotel.,5,2017,05,27
30,Amazing Value,"The staff was professional and courteous.  The room spacious.  Breakfast buffet flavorful.  Amenities many (like the complimentary shuttle to and from the airport and central Barcelona).  As a basis of comparison, the hotel looks and feels like a W. The only drawback is the 20-minute commute to the Ramblas area.  However, if the hotel were centrally located, the rooms would price for twice as much.  Regards to the reception desk staff and shuttle driver!",5,2017,05,23
30,More than expected ,"I've arrived yesterday and I have to say it is one of the best hotels I've ever been
The path room is amazing 
The shower has three modes!

It is close to the metro, staff are really nice
Breakfast is good but no chef to make eggs, other than that it is very nice.",5,2017,05,23
30,"Great view ,tasty food,great service,super clean !!!","Everything was great  !!! Great view , tasty food , great service, super clean !
We like it really so much. Sure we will return next year . 
Javi you are the best! Thank you for your great service. 
Good job !",5,2017,05,22
30,Striking looking but disappointing,"This was the last hotel I stayed in in Spain and was excited that it had a 5 star rating. The lobby was large and impressive with juice and candies available as you enter. The bar, for 6 euros, will make you a specialty drink using fruit and vegetables to detox or burn fat etc. There are 4 elevators and you use a computer system which tells you which one will come next. Two of them have glass outer walls. I stayed on the 20th floor and the hall looked very classy. The room was bright and had a couch, a great addition, but there was nowhere to put my luggage. The drapes operate remotely. The toilet is in its own room but there is no ventilation. The state of the art shower (make sure to read the instructions carefully) is also self-contained, but again has no ventilation. I left the door open to allow it to dry. There are double sinks and this area is beautiful with complimentary toiletries. The cupboards are lined with mirrors which I found disorienting. When you see the bathrobes and slippers, you think there are 4 rather than 2, due to the reflection. There is a safe in the room and I was advised, by my tour guide, to use it. Only carry what you need for the day when you go out and keep your money in a concealed pocket or use a money belt. Breakfast, which is served on the 4th floor, was good. Lots of variety and it opened at 7:00 a.m. There is a subway stop outside the front door and you can travel to the centre of Barcelona for 2 euros. I went to the Museu Picasso and the taxi fare was 18 euros.",3,2017,05,22
30,Probably one of the best..,"...hotels I have had the pleasure to stay at.

I was here for a few days for a conference and this place has the wow factor. It's a little out of the centre of Barcelona but an 10EURO taxi ride soon sorts that out.

The rooms here are of excellent quality, the staff wonderfully helpful and they have a very intelligent lift lobby that despite heavy usage doesn't leave you hanging around.

The views from the hotel are also amazing, I was on the 15th floor and there were many floors above me.

Food and conference facilities also second to none.",5,2017,05,14
30,"Nice views, slow elevators","The day we arrived was a Monday. The hotel was not busy at all and the restaurants were either closed (3 of 4) and the forth one was not inviting at all. The bar on 26th floor was closed as well. Disappointing for a five-star-hotel. Next day everything was fine. Food was good, breakfast too.
Room very nice with views downtown and towards the harbour. 12th floor was okay, higher-up would have been nicer. Time consuming and bothersome were the slow elevators. One had to plan a few extra minutes.",3,2017,05,12
30,Well past it's prime - not a fine stay,"What was once a luxury hotel is now dated, worn & really needs a staff update.  Luckily we were only there for one night. Service at the restaurant bar was horrendous, we waited 20 minutes to get attention of the lone waitstaff who spent most of his time off the floor.  The chairs & carpet throughout the hotel were badly stained.  Worst of all the beds were as hard as cement.   No wonder Priceline accepted my very lowball bid.",2,2017,05,10
30,Slightly overrated,"The hotel is located outside the city center (20min by metro). The rooms are clean, but the floor is really dirty, is has not been cleaned for many days. The breakfast is standard continental. I believe with a little extra push to celebrate service, they can remake it a great hotel!",3,2017,05,10
30,"Not sure how it is rated 5 star, try 3 star","I spent a long time looking for a premium hotel for a break to Barcelona and settled on the Hesperia Tower based on the reviews on Tripadvisor, what a bit mistake, the hotel far underwhelms and as part of the NH hotel group I am surprised it is as tired as it is, perhaps it was nice when it opened but now needs major refurbishment. The lobby is impressive, but the luxury experience ends there, rooms are tired and worn out, our bathroom had chipped tiles, the glass door in the shower was cracked and the space for the shower gel dangling off the wall. The cover for the plug socket in the bathroom was missing providing a safety hazard, the bedroom carpet was tired and worn out with thread showing between there and the tiles against it. wood was scuffed, marked and chipped, the beds look like they are out of a hospital ward with the wheels showing, the phone was missing the information on it telling you what buttons were what - making it guesswork what button was reception when I needed to call down. This isn't just isolated to the room we were in the corridor carpets were tired and worn out and we actually changed rooms when we arrived and the first room was of the same low standard. Breakfast was ok - but the breakfast room is tired looking - coffee machines are turned off and instead we were were guided to flasks of tepid filter coffee and jugs with dribbles of milk in them. Staff were pleasant but it's very missleading having a 5 star rating when it is definitely not 5 star as it spoilt the whole holiday experience. if you are looking for a premium experience you won't find it here!",1,2017,05,10
30,Great View,Stayed at the Hesperia Tower in Barcelona for two nights on business and loved it. The hotel is about 20 minutes from the Airport and probably another 30 minutes from the centre of Barcelona. My room was on the 20th floor so as the name suggests it is a very tall building! Rooms are lovely with very modern decor (first time I have stayed in a room with electric curtains!). The lounge and bar areas are lovely and the buffet breakfast is excellent. There is a fantastic leisure centre about 50 metres from the hotel as well. Great place to base yourself but if you are heading into town every day you will have to bus it or take a taxi. ,5,2017,05,10
30,I would not call it a 5 stars ,"Ok, so I stayed one night in this hotel, the bed and bathroom were clean but the carpet was full of what I think was stains ( room 1005). The room did not have heater, just air conditioner. It was chilly at night and the bed, pillows and comforter were neither comfy or warm. They offer you bathrobes and slippers which are quite rough, the slippers were ok but we just had one pair and I did not bother to ask for another, although I needed as the floor had the appearance of being dirty, or could be the it was only stains. It did had a safe that you can use for free but to use the swimming pool it cost 12 euros per person, what was quite shocking to me! The check in was fast and friendly. If you need to go to the Gothic square is a 45 min trip by metro or 17 euros, 20 min by taxi from the fam√≠lia Sagrada site. If I had stayed for more than a day I would have asked for a cleaner room but because I just stayed a night I let it go. I choose what a thought it was a fancy hotel because I needed a great place to relax knowing I was between flights and cities but this hotel failed to provide me that. The only thing I enjoyed here was the shower. The fresh juice costs 6 euros, be aware! The other problem I faced it was the shuttle from the airport to the hotel. They told me it was coming at 5PM at terminal 1 parking C, well it never showed up. After 4 calls to the hotel trying to know what was going on, they said the next one would be at 6:40 PM and that I should just get a taxi. What? I got a bus to arrive at the hotel and after all the struggles to get there I have all the other surprises mentioned above. I do not recommend this hotel, spend your money elsewhere.",3,2017,05,03
30,Hidden Gem,"Found this hotel / tower last time in Barcelona and it's off the beaten track and not in walking distance of the usual attractions, but it's well priced, ideal for parking and has amazing rooms! Near the airport so handy for that, plus an underground car park, which in Barcelona is a necessity if you have a nice car! Really advise anyone to have a look here, as some of the hotels in the centre are vastly overpriced for what you get and this place is the opposite.",5,2017,05,03
30,Attentive Service,"Great Welcome smiles with a refreshing drink available......to a very cool Hotel not far from the airport.  Up to the 2nd floor restaurant for dinner seated by Edwin who spoke fantastic English and was engaging. Then to be waited on by Jordi who had served us in the cocktail bar earlier.  Can do it all!  Very attentive fussing by both.  We all enjoyed excellent meals and the boys made the night with their personalities.

30,Beautiful weekend stay,"Returned 25th April, stayed for 4 nights. Hotel itself is on the outskirts of the city centre, 30 minutes on the metro which is right outside. Was a bit of a pain as we couldn't just ""nip"" back to hotel, but no hardship. There's absolutely nothing around the hotel to do so great if you're just using it as a base, everything you need within hotel. Reception staff were exceptional, the guy who greets you was so helpful- thank you for informing us of the fountain display in espanya Saturday night, it was breathtaking. Restaurant amazing (although very expensive a la carte- my husband was hungry after :) rooms spotless and cleaned daily. Room service brilliant, just couldn't fault the staff. Thank you to the bi-lingual bar man who made the most amazing strawberry dacarie I have ever had! He worked very hard, there was sweatiness quite a long wait for drinks but wouldn't say it was his fault. Only main disappointment was no tea or coffee in a standard room which I feel lets it down as it is supposed to be 4* and you get that in a travel lodge! Room 12-15 which was about half way up, would recommend getting a higher room for better view, and the carpet was really stained and shabby if I'm honest. However, all round very good stay. Would recommend if you're happy to travel into Cataunya on the metro, which if I can use- anyone can! Only ¬£2 to get into city centre, a taxi was ¬£20. Thank you for a lovely holiday x",4,2017,04,30
30,Not worth the price ,"We got this hotel as a deal from a booking site at 50% discount...even so the conditions were not matching the price. If we would pay the full price... we would be crying for our investment. The hotel had a parking but the smell in the garage/ elevator is beating every sewer. The room were at the opening time very luxury, but now... they are not maintained and they are dirty or damaged. Breakfast was rich... but a bit pricey, however the view is really nice. They offer also a shuttle to the city center, but the time schedules are so ...not fitting someone that want to visit Barcelona ... that you simply don't use it. We had also some difficulty at the reception... with invoices and miss communication between the persons at reception. I really hope they will improve... as they embarrassed the NH title.",3,2017,04,30
30,Wow!,"The room was impressively well-appointed and extremely comfortable.  There was a glass door between the bedroom and bath/closet area, and a wonderful cozy couch overlooking the city. The hotel staff exceeded my expectations in every way.  They were kind, accomodating and helpful.",5,2017,04,26
30,Superb!,"It might be a bit off the city for tourists who don't know the transportation at all but everything else of the hotel, lobby or rooms, is superb. The breakfast also provides a decent varieties to choose from due to its largest volume of customers.  What is clever is to incorporate a walk in closet, toilet, bathroom and wash counter in the same area which gives high efficiency of space using.",5,2017,04,26
30,"Pool, but no pool!","A family reunion with 4 kids. Selected the hotel, because kids love to go in the pool. No kids allowed in the pool.
This message have to be given more up front. Very disappointed about this.
NH Hotels must change this information on the website!",3,2017,04,25
30,Barcelona weekend stay,"Just left the Hesperia Tower and what a place to stay. The reception and lobby area was beautifully modern. This is a very slick designed hotel which continues through the hallways and the rooms and rooftop bar. The rooms were very clean and the bathrooms were amazing with good showers and a great view. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. A special mention to ""Hector"" who helped us organise our trip with places to see and great knowledge of the very efficient metro system. Barcelona is a very beautiful friendly place with more to see and do than just a few days will allow. We will be back and will definitely stay at this hotel again. ",5,2017,04,23
30,Excelente Equipe - Very Nice Staff,"Equipe excelente trabalhando no hotel, principalmente no caf√© da manh√£ aos cuidados de Mait√™ e Carlos.

Very nice staff working, mainly at breakfast restaurant under supervision of Maite and Carlos.

Thank you all!!!",5,2017,04,18
30,A lovely stay at Hesperia Tower,"A great hotel! We had an amazing view from our room and the service was excellent. Javi who welcomed us to breakfast each day was extremely helpful. It was worth paying the extra money for the gym and pool facilities. 

If you're staying make sure you bring a credit card with you! We didn't realise one was needed and it could've caused us all kinds of issues if my boyfriend hadn't happened to have one with him. 

Overall it was a great experience. Close to transport and easy to reach from the airport.",4,2017,04,17
30,A bit off center but totally on point,"My friend and I, very intelligently, decided to book a hotel room 2 weeks prior to our visit to Barcelona, on a weekend with two Adele concerts, two Coldplay concerts (one of which we were attending) and a couple of biggest medical conferences all in the same week. You can imagine our despair when we couldn't find a nice hotel at a reasonable price. You can also imagine our surprise when our travel agent found this hotel! We couldn't believe our luck! 

We stayed for 4 days and 3 nights, had a very nice deal, and loved the hotel very much.

The hotel is a bit outside of central Barcelona area an far from the famous Barcelona sights, HOWEVER, the hotel offers a lot of goodies to make amends. First of all, the hotel provides a free shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel and back, and also from the hotel to the center of Barcelona and back. You can find the shuttle bus schedule and departing stations on the hotel site. Don't worry if you come to the starting station and there are people waiting but no shuttle bus. You have to realize, Catalan people are very easy going and have a flexible understanding of time. The bus will arrive to pick you up, only maybe 5 minutes late. Relax, you in Barcelona.

The next thing that makes traveling easier is the metro station located 2 minutes walking distance from the hotel. It's a 30 minutes metro ride to Placa Catalunya.

The hotel is very nice, modern, clean. The staff is really professional and friendly. A special shout out goes to our receptionist Diego who was from the start very lovely, charming, helpful and gave us all the information we needed. 

The rooms are very nice, comfortable, clean and spacious. We had a room facing east so we had a wonderful view of the city. 

We had breakfast every day, the food is very good and there is a lot to choose from so enjoy what ever you like and whatever you can eat, they have vegan, vegetarian, gluten free...

The hotel bar is also something to see and experience, the bartenders are excellent and friendly.

If you are leaving early in the morning, you can check out the evening before and if you're leaving before breakfast, don't worry, there'll be a small buffet by the front desk from 4 till 6 am for the early departures.

All in all, it was a lovely stay, I still can't believe our luck of finding such a nice, 5 star hotel, for such a reasonable price. If the distance from the city center is bothering you, again - the transportation is very well organized.

When I come again to visit Barcelona, I am definitely staying at Hesperia.",5,2017,04,14
30,Good service and great view,"Hesperia Tower deserves all five stars. It provides what is expected off a five stars hotel. The hotel is located about 7 km from the airport, they provide a free shuttle. Roomservice is fast, the view is great if you stay in the upper floors. Be aware that the spa and fitness is located adjacent to the hotel.",5,2017,04,13
30,Excellent,"During my stay the hotel was faultless. My room was very comfortable, clean and very well equipped with a lot of toiletries. Breakfast excellent and friendly staff. If you are looking for something in the area you can't go wrong with this hotel.",5,2017,04,11
30,Average ,"The hotel is nice, room was nice. The restaurants were closed the  entire time we were there. It's kind of far from the city... it takes a while to get to the main attractions and the train stops at 2400.",3,2017,04,05
30,Mr King,"I felt compelled to write this review following a fantastic stay at this hotel. This was our first visit to Barcelona and it was simply superb! On arrival, we found we had a room upgrade with stunning views over the city. The staff were exceptional- friendly, accommodating and professional. We plan on returning in the near future and will definitely be rebooking the Hesperia. ",5,2017,04,05
30,Weekend break,"The hotel was clean and modern and we were giving a large double room.  We has booked Barcelona  for a long weekend with friends and wished we had picked a hotel closer to the city center.  Although only a short 15mins trip on the tub, the hotel had a very business feel about it and staff didn't really have much personality.
Over all the trip was fab and the as mentioned above the hotel was clean and modern, but probably would be better for a business trip.",3,2017,03,26
30,I came in from London for three nights with my wife to celebrate our 32 years wedding anniversary,"The hotel service was cordial and full of passion. The hotel runs a bus shuttle from and to the airport which made it easy for us to get to the hotel from the airport & vice versa.
The reception was quite welcoming with free drinks after checking in. The buffet breakfast is very good & nourishing. The service guys were very friendly especially Joan who made us very comfortable as the only coloured guests. The restaurant which operates differently  from breakfast is good but service is very slow.
The room is quite attractive, well decorated and neat. The only BUT is the response time for room service which is unnecessarily long.",5,2017,03,24
30,Still my preferred choice for business in Barcelona,"Not in downtown, but a short, confortable 10-15m ride to the heart of the city. Five star hotel at 4 star prices. Large rooms, good breakfast and most convenient for airport commute. On this occasion reception failed to produce an iron for several guests, due to full booking according to the hotel. Internet connection is fair but a nuisance, as you need to log in every time you move about the hotel. ",4,2017,03,23
30,Barcelona vs PSG game,"I came to watch the game and spend some days before my company meeting and I was great experience in the hotel for the first time I use it , location very good as close to the metro and you came travel every where easily and safely , breakfast was one of the best I ever had I travel so many time per week per months every where but no one can even come close to this hotel big thanks to MAYTE for her services and kindness and her team they let me enjoy my staying and the food and the breakfast , reception wasn't that good some of the staff ok but most they don't know how to smile especially Arie as he don't know how to deal with customers , I asked one of the ladies if I can take the glass if the water to my room and return it when I finish drinking the water as I had surgery and I can't drink fast and I have to drink slowly and I just came back from out side and she said I will ask the guy which was Arie and even before she completed  the question he answered no without even look to her or to me so I feel sorry for his services , but over all hotel rooms was good elevator was good location  as good, one more thing I didn't like was that I have to pay for Th gym but the gym it self was great and I enjoyed it big time .",5,2017,03,17
30,"""Attractive decent hotel""","I stayed at the hotel for a 3 day conference.  The hotel does have a shuttle that picks up from Barcelona airport, but had a little difficulty locating the pick up spot which was Parking G, which strangely was not located after Parking D,E,F,  but after Parking C which was a bit of a walk from the terminal. The front desk is OK, seemed very business like, though they did allow an early check in at 10am. The rooms are OK, no iron/ironing board that I could locate. Shower is great. The buffet breakfast is decent. Most important to me was the 2 minute walk to the Metro, from where I could explore the whole of Barcelona for 2.45 Euros a trip.",4,2017,03,17
30,A flying visit - one night (about 7 hours....),"Stayed here for a business trip in February. Arrived at 1130pm and left after breakfast at 0730 am so not a long visit! On the plus side, short transfer from the airport and close to the office I was visiting. Also a big plus, upgraded to a suite (the mobile world congress was on so everywhere was busy!)  

Suite was lovely - but couldn't really enjoy it as there for such a short time. Big jacuzzi bath in the bedroom (upstairs) and lounge area with separate loo downstairs. Bed was comfy but was a bit annoying for a business traveller to be up and down stairs (would have been lovely on a vacation) Nice to have complimentary water and also shower product on arrival

I think the only thing was that the decor looked a bit tired. In the bathroom area, looked like it needed a bit of a tidy up round the edges. 

Breakfast had a good range but the room was so dark! Would have liked a bit more light to help me wake up in the morning",4,2017,03,12
30,Good airport hotel,This is a good airport hotel. It has good conference facilities. The suit that I stayed was good with two floors! But the bathrooms were small. I had access to the Tower lounge but this was a disappointment. The door would not open with the key provided and the snacks and drinks were not up to par. Breakfast was good. The restaurant in the lobby was good for snacks and the main restaurant was good as well. Overall this is good airport hotel. It says that it is a five star hotel but it does not live to that categorization. It is far from the city and so there is no restaurants nearby.,3,2017,03,08
30,Best option for flight transfer night in Barcelona.,"I stayed with my girlfriend at hesperia tower for 1 night for a flight transfer in barcelona. Choose the hotel because of the proximity of the airport and because of the star rating.The hotel suited our needs great although for the price payed and 5 star rating we were expecting a bit more facilities. 

Negative:
-The spa is outside the building, therefore you need to leave the hotel, walk in the street to go to the spa and pay a fee per person. The spa is not 5 star quality, it is a regular gym/club indoor pool full of people and therefore not very relaxing.
-Transfer to the airport/city has very limited hours, transfer should happen according to guests needs for departures and arrivals at the airport.
After booking the hotel I wasn't informed that there was a complimentary transfer airport - hotel. I think the hotel should send an e-mail to guests informing if they arrive by airplane such service exists. Although the airport is in the proximity of the hotel, it still is a 20‚Ç¨ taxi ride from airport to hotel.
Because of the facilities offered, room and food quality, it feels more as a good, modern, quality, business 4 Star hotel.

Positive:
Friendly and professional staff that makes you feel at home and attended your needs with care. Special remark for roger at the reception and also marco at the bar who was great, he made amazing drinks and mades us feel special and welcomed at the hotel.
Modern, clean and comfortable rooms.
Best pick for a flight transfer at Barcelona el prat airport. I would return again.",4,2017,03,04
30,Maybe a business hotel...,"Postives: 
Nice room, good breakfast, nice enough staff from what I experienced, very modern hotel generally, close to airport

Negatives: 
No restaurants or attractions within walking distance, 30 minute metro to centre, the gym and pool are not included and cost $12 per day, the shower was rubbish and the bed was not particularly comfortable

Nice hotel mostly but awful location and wouldn't recommend as 5 star hotels do not mean anything if they are in the middle of nowhere. Probably good for short business trips, but if you want to visit the attractions, I'm sure there are many other better options.",2,2017,02,15
30,Business trip,"Nice hotel near the airport of Barcelona and 15 minutes drive from the famous La Ramblas street in Barcelona.
Nice rooms with large bed and bathroom.

Down stairs in the lobby, great opportunaty for networking and relaxing at the same time.

Great hotel for short business trips.
",4,2017,02,13
30,Outside doesn't justify the inside- a stunning hotel,"Stayed there for a night for business. Welcome great, room fantastic ( if you can spend a little more, ask for room 1214). Simply stunning. Great attention to detail in the room
Simply can't fault it and would definitely recommend it. ",5,2017,02,05
30,Very nice experience ,Very nice hotel with great gym. Very close to subway and bus stop. Hotel stuff is great and professional. Javier (hotel employee) that I met during breakfast is a walking database of things that you should do or visit in Barcelona. He was extremely kind and helpful - you should try to find him during breakfast in Azimuth restaurant.,5,2017,01,27
30,A good hotel for business trips but also for holidays?,"I visited the Hesperia Tower for a business event in Barcelona at the end of August.  Rooms are very functional but slightly dated.  Too bad I had to find the left-overs of the previous guest in the fridge.
Hesperia Tower is located outside the city center and that is a bit petty if you want to combine business with pleasure.  Walking to the e.g. the Ramblas would probably take you an hour of so.  On the other hand, they offer a free shuttle service to the city center and the beach; if you want to go to the city center, make use of it ... The driver I had is very cooperative and explained me what I certainly should have seen,knowing that I had to condense the tourist-part of my stay in 1/2 day.  Unfortunately this service is not offered until the late afternoon/ early evening, so if you want to do some clubbing you'll have to start early ... 
Overall, the Hesperia hosts were very cooperative, from reception to the bar tender.  One downside for me was that - in my opinion - in the direct area there isn't that much catering other than the local snack.  But this comes with the area the hotel is located in; having seen some holiday tourists this is mainly a business hotel (but it might be that my impression is disrupted by the fact that virtually 50% of the guest were going to the same congress as me.
By the way ... Room service catering is excellent.  A lot of choice at a very attractive price, compared with what I've seen in other hotels.I can suggest the suggest the Seafood Caeser's Salad with the local white wine.
Too bad that the elipse on top of the tower was/is not open for the public.",4,2017,01,19
30,Best business hotel in town,"Nice hotel, very convenient, spacious rooms, good and quick restaurant, nice bio cocktails at the bar... my preferred address in Barcelona, even if it is not in the city center (but it is very close from the airport in return!).",5,2017,01,18
30,Wow!,"Very friendly reception staff, great looking lobby area. Wonderful suite in the neighbouring building, very clean and sound-proof. The design/furniture of the room will be outdated in about 2 or 3 years, so that will be the first upcoming point of attention.
Incredible quality of room service dishes and in the morning the most unbelievable breakfast. I guess the second best breakfast buffet I have had in all my stays worldwide, only beaten by the W Hotel in Hong Kong.",5,2017,01,18
30,Hotel nice - service ...ehh,"We booked this hotel specifically next to the airport so we can get a ride there we even called and confirmed they have a shuttle to the airport on the day of our flight 
 Then when we check in and make arrangements to get the shuttle we were told sorry we're not offering it at that time it's too early but your website says you have the shuttle 24 hours yeah but sorry it's too early 
 The waiter in the restaurant was OK the front desk not so much 
 Check in check out they were just average 
 When we asked for help getting tickets for the Barcelona game they couldn't be bothered 
So the room was real nice but the staff can use an upgrade",3,2017,01,18
30,Early check-in one night stay.,"An impressive modern 29 floor building in the outskirts of Barcelona close to the airport. We came by car en route to our place in Spain. The reception desk staff were extremely helpful with very good English. The four lifts were fast, hitec and efficient. We expected more from our room for a 5 star hotel but the bed was comfortable and WiFi connection great. We used the shuttle minibus service to the heart of town and that was really fab. Breakfast was one of the best we have had. The friendly service was next to non. Our stay was excellent value.",4,2017,01,09
30,"Nice hotel, easy to get to from the Airport","Nice clean hotel that offers a shuttle service to and from the airport.  It is a little way out from the town center but there is a Metro station nearby and good bus links.

I was visiting an event at fior and found that if you walked 5 mins round the back of the hotel there was a bus that took you straight there.

Food in the restaurant was very expensive but nice.  The breakfast selection was always excellent and quick.",4,2017,01,06
30,New Years Eve Holiday,"I liked the hotel very much, it surprised me. Very good room. View of the City and Tibidabo. Easy access, Metro station very near, with direct line to Placa de Catalunya, the center of the city. Very good breakfast, nice that on sunday until 12:00 you can eat Breakfast.
Very nice shower and toilet, also the beds very confortable and the temperature in the room was very good.
Room cleaning was daily and prompt.",5,2017,01,04
30,What a VIEW,"Stunning view from both rooms that we had, Really nice staff and breakfast was amazing, gives you a good start into the day. We did have dinner at the hotel wich was good as well, Would definitely stay there again!",5,2017,01,03
30,Amazing hotel! ,"From the moment we arrived until the moment we left it was absolutely amazing, the staff are completely out of this world!! Receptionist, bar staff and shuttle bus driver (Alberto??) were amazing, fun, friendly and warming people! Food quality was fantastic along with the service and we honestly cannot recommend this hotel any higher. Truly fantastic ",5,2017,01,01
30,Fantastic hotel great staff. Perfect.,"We enjoyed our stay in December. The hotel was very quiet which was nice but the staff were very helpful and accommodating with our needs. They even surprised my husband with a birthday cake as he turned 30 whilst being away (birthday treat to Barcelona) location wasn't great however 3 minute walk to the metro which was good. 

Rooms were very clean with everything you need. Shower was AMAZING! Only down side to room was only 1 English Channel and that was the world news that was on repeat however we weren't there to watch TV! 

Overall great trip great stay the complementary bus to airport on way home was well recieved too. 

Thank you ",5,2016,12,27
30,Room change,"We were booked into the hesperia apartments, not to clever in my honest opinion and definitely not 5 star. 
We raised the issue with the assistant manager Erik, he couldn't of been more understanding and helpful. Changed our room straight away, and in a gesture of good will upgraded us to a fantastic duplex room.
 All staff were amazing and helpful on all accounts.thankyou for a great stay

They also run a free shuttle service to airport and into Barcelona a few times a day..",5,2016,12,18
30,Good but not great,"The hotel is pretty good. Specius rooms, clean and modern. I was surprised that there was no coffee or tea making facilities in the room. I manage a 3 star hotel and all of our rooms have a kettle, tea and coffee. Very strange that a 5 star hotel did not provide the 3. You had to order coffee or tea from the restaurant. The hotel is located between the airport and the city centre. It takes about 30 minutes on the metro to get into town. The bathroom shower had some black mould most likely due to poor ventilation. The rooms are lovely with a great view if you are on a higher floor. The receptionist who checked us in and out was fantastic. All all all it was a lovely stay.",4,2016,12,15
30,the food and the spa,"really nice room, bigger than expected. Good treat. Specially enjoy the relaxation at spa and the restaurant! nice one!
A bit far from the city center but they are taking really good care of the customer!",4,2016,12,13
30,nice place," When we got there, i had to try a little bit of everything. There was so many choices! I had the Orange Maki roll. Hands down, best sushi I've ever had. The service was outstanding and the food was fresh. Not to mention, the price of the food was very reasonable :) They also offer cooking classes and catering. This is definitely my first pick for authentic Asian cuisine in Hesperia :)",5,2016,12,06
30,Nice Hesperience,"Nice hotel for a reasonable price for this class of hotel. Although far from touristic area, metro is close by (5 minutes walk). Close to the airport which result in little to no traffic congestions when catching a flight.",4,2016,12,01
30,"Amazing rooms, but missing some detail","Having just returned from a 3 night stay with my partner, we stayed at the Hesperia tower.  

Firstly they run a free shuttle service from the Airport to the hotel BE CAREFUL as it is not very clear on booking that the shuttle is not regular (1pm and 5.20pm), we waited over an hour before managing to contact the hotel who advised us the next bus was not for 2.5 hours.  We then got a taxi which cost 22 Euros and was approx 15 mins drive.

On arrival at the hotel, first impressions from the outside is it doesnt look like a hotel and needs some TLC on the exterior.

The reception area was very modern and nice looking, but very quiet, definitely a business hotel.  The receptionist who checked us in was very helpful, offering some advice on places to visit, public transport etc, providing maps and suggesting the best spots for us to go.

The room we had was on floor 11 and on opening the door we both said WOW.  The bathroom was incredible, with separate shower, WC, double basins and a mirrored wardrobe area, then through to the bedroom which was tastefully decorated with electric curtains and a nice view.  My partner had requested extras as was a special occasion but he said nothing was done however the room was lovely and room service came daily.  On one day they forgot to leave any fresh towels but on calling reception we were brought some more.

The bed was massive, with plenty of pillows also so very comfortable nights sleep and also quiet even being so close to the motorway.

There is a hairdryer, bathrobes, slippers (1 pair), shoe polisher and toiletries and also a ipod dock, (we dont have iphones so that was a downside and apparently its an old connection and wouldnt fit current iphones) shame as there is a speak in the bathroom too.

The shower is lovely but ours had some broken sprays on the body sprays but the rainfall head was amazing,

Downsides to the room - there is only one english channel on the tv, which is a repeat by the hour of the news.  There is no complimentary water in the room, the water is in a cupboard charged at 6 euros a bottle!! there is also a minibar which we didnt use.  Careful if you lift any items out to look as they are sensored so a charge is applied as it thinks you have taken the item.  Everything in the room is chargeable.

The biggest downside is that there is no tea and coffee facility in the rooms!!  I thought this was a basic amenity of even a 3* so for a 5* not to provide this it was very disappointing and on top of that a tea/coffee is 3-4 euros on the room service so we had to travel 20 mins before even getting a normal priced morning drink.

The location of the hotel is between the airport and the centre.  There is a Metro station literally outside the hotel however it is very unclear where the entrace is and having walked all round the hospital (about 15 mins) we were shown the entrance by a local who walked us all the way back.  (its across the roundabout, then across the carpark walking diagonally and there is steps down to the metro line).  We brought a T-10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys which lasted us the 3 days for 9.95 Euros each.  The journey is approx 20 mins so being far out is not too bad but best to plan to stay out until your ready to call it a day rather than going back and forth on the metro line.

There is a petrol station just across the road where you can get some alcohol and snacks and water but its limited.

The alcohol in the hotel it VERY expensive.  We did not eat at the hotel having looked at the cost of the food so cannot comment on this but breakfast is also very expensive.

The spa is not actually within the hotel its round the back, we had a quick look round but the lady on reception was not very welcoming so we only stayed a couple of minutes, the pool looked nice but couldnt see much else and you have to buy a pass to use the facilities in there.

We inquired as to what the dome at the top of the hotel was, this was for private hire only.  Missing a trick here as that would be a great spot for drinks for hotel guests and would make me want to stay at the hotel and drink at this bar, instead we went out every night as the downstairs bar was so quiet without any atmosphere.

All in all a nice hotel, needs the basic touches which are missing though.  If you dont mind a tube journey this is a great hotel.",4,2016,11,30
30,Smoke and Mirrors,"Well talk about going up in the world! We were greeted at the Hesperia Tower by a very polite, efficient, helpful, knowledgeable young lady called Layla (as an avid Clapton fan I knew this was an portent of good fortune). We were given our keys and directed to a transportation pod (lift) which took us to our room on the 21st floor. Opened the door, turned on the lights and.......stepped back in amazement!! we had entered a world of mirrors, smoked glass and mahogany......fantastic!! But behind which smoke glass panel lay what, which was the shower, which was the bedroom, where was the loo? Discovering the bedroom was another jaw dropping experience.. beautifully laid out, great furnishings, a magnificent king sized bed and an absolutely unbeatable view over Barcelona. Erm! unbeatable? It wasn't actually because a visit to the rooftop ""Dome"" restaurant not only provided excellent cuisine but the higher vantage point made the 360degree panorama just incredible.
So great place, great service, great food(little pricey but worth it).
Not a city centre hotel but for 10 euros per person we made good use of the metro and bus system without any problem or hassle. In fact prior to visiting Barcelona I had been warned about all sorts of skullduggery but in the four days we were there we were never once approached by any unsavouries, everyone we met were extremely polite and friendly and we witnessed more acts of kindness, good manners, respectful behaviour in those four days than I have seen anywhere......home, London,Paris,Sydney, New York, Los Angeles anywhere!",5,2016,11,28
30,"Plush interior, fantastic service. ","My girlfriend and I stayed in this wonderful hotel for the last 3 nights. The service throughout our stay was nothing short of incredible. 

It is a 10 minute taxi ride to the hotel, costing 15 euros, although we later discovered there was a free shuttle bus going to the hotel. 

The hotel is located a 2 minute walk away from the metro, which takes you to the heart of the city in around 15 minutes. This was ideal as we had such a wonderful hotel but we're not kept up by the noisy city centre. 

The food in the hotel was exceptional. And when we came back from the city centre, Mexican Marco behind the bar made us exceptional late night cocktails, and is the friendliest bar tender I have ever met. Not taking anything away from this amazing hotel and all it's helpful staff, the one slight problem we had was the room key card kept failing and we had to come and reset it, however every cloud has a silver lining, it was a great excuse to go and see Marco for some more cocktails!!! 

I can not recommend this place enough. Barcelona is a wonderful city, and the Hesperia Tower is a credit to the city! 

We shall definitely be returning. ",5,2016,11,28
30,Excellent Stay,Excellent stay at NH Hesperia Tower in Superior room w/Double beds. Restaurant on site with good options. It  would have been nice to include Breakfast in the price of lodging. Had to pay nearly 25 euros for the breakfast.,5,2016,11,27
30,Good hotel near the airport.,"If you are considering this location, it is highly likely that the close proximity to the airport is one of the major considerations.

Besides providing shuttle service to both the town and the airport (do check the schedule on the hotel website), does the Hotel meets the 5 stars standard? I would say close enough. Generally the hotel has some wear due to time but it is generally comfortable and clean. The toilets and the bathroom were high end, spacious and modern. The beds were comfy, though it can sink a little when one lie on it. The neighborhood is quiet but I don't recommend walking around, anyway there is nothing much around. 

If you get a good deal, rented a car(free parking by the front), need to rush to the airport early in the morning, this is a good choice.",4,2016,11,26
30,Quick Airport Layover,"Stayed Oct.29-30
Can`t really give this place a real good assessment as this was booked as a layover hotel.
Room: on the 17th floor, nice sized, modern and well appointed, wi-fi,nice bathroom.
location: centrally located between the Airport and Barcelona,near the metro line. made for easy access to airport, but if staying any length of time, would prefer to be in barcelona down town area.
staff: got in late(1900) and had to leave early the next morning(0430), staff made sure we were up and at em and had a carafe of coffee for us to kick start the day- much appreciated.
A couple of restaurants, all a bit pricey, but there is not a lot around to pick from.
a solid 4 , the only thing holding this back is the location from Barcelona proper.",4,2016,11,25
30,Our stay in November ,"Stayed here for 3 nights in a suite on the 25 floor overlooking the beautiful city of Barcelona. Room 2504 
What a wonderful hotel, a great ambience and wow factor inside this great building I can throughly recommend you upgrade to a suit upon arrival as we did, you will not be disappointed 
A special mention for our evening/night receptionist/ concierge Roger, you have made our stay with you something special with all your shared local knowledge and helpful advice. 
Nothing seems too much trouble for this kind man , lending us an umbrella for or short walk to the metro station during a heavy downpour... we thank you
If you take the time to walk behind the hotel there is a square with shops and cafe and beautiful parks. This is a fab location for exploring this city.. free courtesy bus to and from city centre and airport.
The bed was very comfy and bathroom amenities wonderful from walk in shower to jacuzzi bath....one useful tip for our next stay here, bring some teabags....",5,2016,11,24
30,MGN_review,"Excellent hotel, nice view on the mideterranean, close by the airport and well connected to the city becasue of the metro close by. But has to improve the lift system ! We were 200 people from the same company attending a conference, in the morning it was awful to use the lift as everybody had to use it ! Sometimes spent 15 min just in the lift which had to stop at each floor, sometimes for nothing. There was no alternative to go down or upstairs !",5,2016,11,24
30,Hesperia Tower assessment,"Rooms are very deluxe. Many mirrors give a special atmosphere.
Elevator control can sometimes cause a large delay ( e.g. during breakfast, when
it is crowded.
WiFi access was o.k. for smartphone 
, but difficult for laptop. The hotel is close to a metro station.",4,2016,11,23
30,fantastic hotel and services,"we spent good time at meeting rooms, restaruants and of course in nice and clean rooms.
Good connection from the airport - shuttle bus or public transport, close to the metro station with connection to the city center!",5,2016,11,16
30,Absolutely perfect!!,"My fianc√© and I stayed here for a long weekend and enjoyed every minute. The staff were attentive and very friendly. My fianc√©s birthday was on the Saturday, which obviously registered on their computer and we came back to the hotel room after an awesome day of sightseeing to a beautiful little birthday cake, a complementary bottle of water and a lovely note saying happy birthday!!! The room was immaculate and we had the best view of the city. It's only a short 2 minute walk to the metro too. We will definitely be staying here again!!! Love love love!!!!! ",5,2016,11,15
30,Great value 5 star hotel,"Having to spend an overnight in Barcelona near the airport for an early morning flight, we were very very fortunate to have booked this hotel.  Our bedroom on the 20th floor of this ultra modern hotel, had spectacular views,  It was beautifully furnished and very comfortable.  Staff, particularly the receptionist on our arrival and the 2 male receptionists on our departure were very friendly and helpful.  The only criticism we had was the temperature in the bar area where we had a meal, was too cool for our comfort - perhaps the air-conditioning was too effective!",5,2016,11,13
30,"Nice hotel, but could use a little tlc","Nice hotel overall, but the hallways could use a little work. Repainting and new carpeting would be nice. Great for a quick business trip, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The spa was great to relax after a long day in meetings.",4,2016,11,08
30,"Great hotel, few things to improve","Stayed for 5 days in October.
Very friendly staff and great facilities. 
Room size was excellent with a fantastic shower in the room (jets, rain shower and directional head)

The corridor and room fittings were looking tired though and while there was a great Phillips iPod dock music system, the iPod dock under the flap was filthy and looked like someone had spilled something in it.

No iron in room, but housekeeping delivered a steam iron.

Breakfast and room service selection was good and tasty.

The hotel itself is pretty near the airport but a fair distance from central Barcelona.

If they refreshed the rooms/corridor then would definitely stay again.",4,2016,11,06
30,Poor handling of communications,"The hotel is OK. However, it's very poor in handling phone or email communications. I sent email before I arrived, to make a small change to the booking. No response whatsoever until I actually called their reception. And then after check out, I realized I lost the invoice. I need the invoice for claiming the expenses, so I called the hotel again. Was told to email instead. I emailed and received no response. I called after two days and was told to just wait for response to email. Waited for three days, and sent a follow up email. No response. I will try to call again, but basically quite disappointed with the level of service. ",2,2016,11,03
30,Mr & Mrs,"Hotel was great with great breakfast & shuttle service.
Staff is helpful & food is excellent...will endorse this hotel to friends...plan to stay here on next visit to Barcelona...thank you very much very much ",5,2016,11,02
30,Better than Expected!,"I lowered my expectations after reading some of the TripAdvisor reviews. It might have something to do with my ""better than expected"" review. 

4-stars for the room:
The room we had was on the upper floors. It was very spacious and comfortable. The black decor with lots of mirrors and light tan corduroy? fabric headboard weren't my taste but the room had very good lighting and plenty of counter space. It was cloudy and foggy outside that day, we didn't get the best view of Barcelona despite of the room's ceiling-high windows. 

2 stars for hotel location:
We returned to Barcelona after visiting Mallorca. We needed a hotel only for one night before our early flight home. Hesperia Tower is located about a 10-minute taxi ride to/from the airport by the University of Barcelona. The taxi driver circled around the area for an extra 10 minutes from the airport to the hotel. We didn't know if it was intentional or she was lost. The next day, it took us about 10 minutes to return to the airport on a different taxi. 

There're scarcely any cafes or restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. There're also no convenience shops nearby or inside the hotel. Needless to say, the prices of food and drinks are very expensive at the cafe and restaurants inside the hotel. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was offered to us at a special price of 23‚Ç¨ per person. We ate our last dinner in Barcelona at Restaurante Boutique inside the hotel and was disappointed with the food. 

",3,2016,11,02
30,"large, modern, outside Barcelona","We stayed here in June 2016. This is a large modern hotel outside city center of Barcelona, next to highway/hospital, closer to the airport. You have to use either hotel shuttle, a taxi or metro to get around. The hotel shuttle that takes you to their sister hotel in the city center for free, but only goes certain times of the day and can fill up quickly with other guests. The metro terminal is a short 5 minute to the metro terminal. The rooms are nice and modern. The breakfast included was good. The area is quiet, not much to do. The staff is real nice--my son left his expensive retainer (dental) at the hotel restaurant and they delivered it to us after they found it!",4,2016,10,29
30,Gorgeous lobby,"My husband and I stayed there the end of September and it was very beautiful! The people at the front desk was very helpful and friendly.

Our room was on the 19tu floor, very quiet, we even were upgraded without asking!",4,2016,10,19
30,Great place with beautiful view,Hesperia Tower is very modern hotel with beautiful view. Room was really nice furnished whith window wall and through it we could see wonderful Barcelona's panorama. Room service was excellent and food was delicious with rich of choices. Hotel has free of charge shutlle bus from and to the airport and the city center but also metro station is just few steps away. I really recommend staying in this hotel.,5,2016,10,18
30,Good visit ,"Although I was a bit disappointed with this hotel as it was surely not 5 star, I would stay again. The rooms are spacious as is the bathroom area.  I was excited about the automatic curtains however they were broken in our room. The toilet seat was broken upon arrival. The shower was great but don't look up, as there is visible mold. There was garbage left in the garbage can from the previous guest. There were many English speaking guests but the staff at the front desk was limited with English. I am glad I brushed up on my Spanish and managed to communicate. The hotel is in the airport side of the city and there is no place within walking distance besides a gas station with a small convenience shop.  It is a very modern fun hotel and even with the flaws as stated , I would stay again. ",3,2016,10,17
30,Impressive modern hotel with easy airport access,"Stunningly attractive design, quite unexpected in this location.  My wife and I stayed here after returning from a Mediterranean cruise.  We weren't quite sure what we'd find, but were delighted with our welcoming greeting, the design and comfort of our spacious room, and the hotel's truly impressive restaurant.  We arrived early, but were immediately made to feel welcome as we settled into the lobby bar for a much-needed glass of local wine.  The check-in person was both friendly and helpful.  While we only stayed one night, we loved it.  And we'll be back.",5,2016,10,16
30,"Lovely place, a little far from the centre ","This is a lovely hotel, the room was lovely and all the staff were very helpful.

We got a free up grade on our room which had stunning views. A down side to the rooms was that it did not have an iron. 

There is a restaurant in the hotel which is ok but a little pricey for the food as it was just average. 

The hotel is a little further from the centre than we had hoped. But there is a nearby metro stop which is close by and it is easy to use. You can buy a metro ticket that allows 10 trips for ‚Ç¨10 and you can share this between yourself.

30,Excellent Value,"I visited the hotel on a business trip and was really impressed with the services and facilities. The meetings and events team were amazing, nothing was too much trouble, and they dealt with every request with a smile. 
The bedrooms are well appointed with lovely bathrooms and represent extremely good value compared to other hotels of a similar standard. 
The hotel have a really smart executive lounge which serves complimentary drinks and light snacks throughout the day, you get access by booking an executive bedroom.
The buffet breakfast was really good land catered to an international group with lots of choice. The Axis bar in the lobby serves bar food , healthy smoothies freshly made to order and their coffee is really good. The Bouquet restaurant was of a really good standard and the food was delicious  so would recommend you have at least one meal there during your stay. The only criticism was that as the restaurant was so busy on the night we ate there the service was a little slow.
There was free wi fi throughout the hotel but not the fastest connection.
Although the location is outside the city centre it's a short trip by taxi or metro and the hotel also run a shuttle service -although I didn't get the opportunity to use it...and it's  very close to the airport  so a really quick transfer to and from.
Great value !",5,2016,10,16
30,Top quality!,"If you're looking for a 5* hotel at an affordable price then look no further. Hesperia Tower was a little further out of the city centre than I would've liked, but staff at the hotel were more than happy to help with directions and public transport. Upon arrival I was provided with a map and a timetable for the hotel shuttle, the woman on reception kindly circled the main attractions and detailed how i could get to them via the metro. Luckily the nearest metro station was just a short walk from the hotel and it runs late into the night and early hours of the morning. 

Thankfully the hotel also offers a variety of shuttle services which run throughout the day into early evening, taking hotel guests to any of these 3 locations; Placa de Catalunya, Gava Beach or the airport.

The hotel was nothing short of spectacular, incredibly modern design, with detail going into every inch of the building. My room was like a suite with the most breathtaking views. Each day the refreshments would be restocked, bedding would be changed and fresh towels would be left. Even though i was unsure how to work the shower, when i rung through to reception they sent a member of staff up immediately to help me. 

The interactions i did have with staff was pleasant, they were helpful and chatty, which is exactly what i like. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a classy hotel, without being overpriced.",5,2016,10,07
30,Amazing,"Best hotel Iv ever stayed in for that standard back in England looking at 300 a night in a main city , I was wowed by it , are room was so nice  best hotel room Iv stayed in , ther was a free shuttle but we always got a taxi maybe some times a metro back to save , taxi was between 15/20 euro only took ten/15 min to the city depending on what time of day , the hotel was great value for money and well worth the little distance from the main city , we can for my boyfriends birthday  Perfect for mini break , my only bad point was the first night we desided to eat at the restraint and the service was very bad and my lamb was cold did get ask if we would like a drink for ages , that was the only bad think I think maybe a lot laid back than us English ",5,2016,10,04
30,Very nice and elegant room.,"Loved the breakfast, loved the room, ok staf.
Also we had a conference with 1400 people at the hotel and they managed that very well I think.
Maybe the beds was a bit hard, a little bit too hard for me.
And the wifi was a bit slow.
Otherwise everything was excellent.",4,2016,10,04
30,Decent,"3 night stay at the Hesperia Tower.  First impressions were extremely positive and the room looked fantastic with good views towards the city.  The metro is only a 2 minute walk and is easy to navigate - it's a straight 25-minute journey into the heart of the city.

Service was good overall, although our room was only made up after the first night.  (The housekeeping staff had clearly been in to check the minibar though)

We were disappointed in the lack of some basic amenities in the room, such as tea/coffee making facilities and an iron, which you would expect from a supposed 5-star hotel.  The spa is fantastic (and highly recommended) but we felt the supplementary ‚Ç¨12 charge per staying guest was steep, especially if you don't have a swimming cap and flip-flops which necessitates an additional ‚Ç¨5 fee.",4,2016,10,04
30,Birthday celebration,"Many thanks to the staff who made my husband's birthday so memorable and also retrieving his birthday money. Excellent service with friendly helpful staff  and will highly recommend hotel.
Also excellent location for metro and airport.",5,2016,10,03
30,Location Might Not Work for You!,"We were able to check in immediately after arrival at 10:00 am after many hours of international travel - really appreciated this!  We also used the free hotel shuttle from the airport.  VERY difficult to find the shuttle location - so don't count on using it!  

Large high rise with a very contemporary feel.  Unfortunately, our room was a bit shabby - spots on the sofa, small chunks of wood missing from bedside tables.  The shower leaked into the adjoining W.C. and left about 1 inch of water for us to clean up.  We booked our room through Hotwire so we got a good value for the price we paid.  If we paid full price, I would have been really unhappy.  This hotel does not deserve a 5 star rating - maybe a 3.5 star by U.S. standards.

The location is fine if you don't care about being in the heart of Barcelona.  It is about 1/2 hour by subway, which is located close by in a parking lot for a hospital.  We couldn't get clear directions to the subway station from the front desk, but fortunately encountered an English speaking resident who helped us after we wandered around the parking lot for 10 minutes looking for it. 

There's a casual mini mall area frequented by lots of locals and many children a few blocks away for a light bite to eat and a real sense of the culture.  Turn right out of the hotel's front door, walk one block, turn right again, walk about a block, and then turn left to stroll down the next several streets.  You'll find a couple of small markets, a bakery, an ice cream shop, etc.

The hotel restaurants were rather pricey, so we set out looking for the ONLY restaurant nearby, called La Flama.  It was about a 30 minute walk!  The food here was typical local food in a casual eatery - we enjoyed the 3 small plates we ordered, which weren't small at all.  Calamari, potatoes with a garlicky sauce, and fried sardines.  Their menu was extensive, and also in about 8 languages (including Chinese and Greek)!",4,2016,10,01
30,good location and nice room,Stayed for a night during a trip in Barcelona. close to airport with scheduled free shuttle. The room is clean and spacious. Buffet style breakfast is also good. Being close to metro and bus stations is also a bonus.,5,2016,09,28
30,Hotel has potential but poor service and hidden fees ruin the experience.,"We stayed here for 4 nights during our trip to Barcelona. We chose this hotel because the pictures looked nice and got good reviews. We arrived at the hotel around 10pm straight from the airport. We were starving and the front desk agent recommended the hotels restaurant. We decided to go there since we were so tired and the host lectured us about how we need to have reservations in Spain and said he couldnt seat us for 30-40 minutes, despite having 10 open tables in plain sight. How could we make a reservation if we just arrived?! 

Pros: 
-Close to metro stop which is 25 minutes to main city square (Catalunya) once you get on
-Newer hotel with updated finishes in the room 

Cons: 
- Booked this because it boasted about the gym in the description. Upon arrival we were told the gym is a steep $12 euros per day per person to use. 
- Room did not include a iron. When we called for one, it took 30 minutes. The iron was removed from our room during the cleaning service so we had to request it every day. 
- Hotel shuttle fills up quickly and does not have enough room for everybody. 
- Staff does not care about customer service. 
- Water from shower seeps into the toilet area",3,2016,09,21
30,Birthday weekend away,"Fabulous experience. Exactly what you expect from a 5 star hotel. I ate the best Sea bream I've ever had in one of their restaurants. Rooms immaculate, staff friendly. They even left me a birthday cake in my room the night of my birthday. 
Not much to see outside the hotel but its a 2 minute walk to the train station. I will return and I would definitely recommend. Great for a couples getawayüòè",5,2016,09,19
30,Hesperia,"The hotel is probably the best one we had stayed in on our 3 week trip. Beautiful rooms, bathrooms,view, lounge area and a great breakfast, big buffet with something of everything. The hotel offers complementary transfers to the beach, airport and city centre. Staff was friendly and we would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,09,19
30,Was Nice Stay,"Excellent Hotel Design at suitable price
Hope next time you have more frequent trips to downtown Barcelona so it can be also mix joy between business and pleasure 
Friendly Staff
Was Nice Stay to be repeated",5,2016,09,18
30,Wonderful!!!,"Would recommend Hesperia Tower to anyone travelling to Barcelona, located between Barcelona airport and the city centre. There is the metro line available and a free shuttle bus to and from the hotel (limited spaces) - having said this, a taxi journey costs around 15‚Ç¨ into the centre. 

The staff are extremely helpful and welcoming and couldn't do enough to ensure you have an enjoyable stay. 

The food at the hotel is brilliant; a good selection to choose from, cooked to a lovely standard and plenty of it! 

If I'm lucky enough to come back to Barcelona, I'm 100% staying in Hesperia Tower! ",5,2016,09,14
30,Hesperia Tower hotel made our trip!,"We arrived to the hotel with a lovely welcome by the reception staff who were very friendly and accommodating. For my partners birthday we were upgraded to a junior suit and had a birthday cake brought to the room which was such a lovely touch. The reception staff were helpful with any questions we had about the hotel, transport and surrounding area. Any phone calls made or requests to the reception were always dealt with promptly. 

The room was clean with beautiful modern furnishings and stunning view of the City. The bathroom/dressing area was great for getting ready with superb mirrors and beautiful marble and oak fittings. I would want this in my own bathroom ! 

The decor of the hotel was modern sleek and sophisticated this set the relaxing mood in the bar/reception area which we enjoyed a cocktail in there after returning back from the City. The cocktails were lovely! 

Travelling around: 
We purchased a T10 underground ticket but found the taxi's to be fairly reasonable ranging from 12-18 euros one way. The times we did go on the underground it took around 20 minutes to Catalunya.  

I don't know how there could be any negatives about this hotel, we certainly going to recommend to friends and family. 

The only suggestions would be there to be air con in the corridor/lift areas and cheaper breakfast option as we were informed it would have been 22 euros each. We would have ordered breakfast if it wasn't this much. I would have loved to have eaten in the Evo restaurant at the top of the hotel but this was closed but not sure the reason for this. We didn't eat in the hotel but saw the lobby bar/restaurant area always busy.

I have never completed a review before but I felt I needed to as this was an outstanding hotel and the best we had stayed at. I would say it is worth 5 stars and has a luxury feel. 

We are travelling to Amsterdam in the near future (November 2016), we will certainly look to book with the NH hotel group. We hope to get the same experience and value for money in one of the NH hotels in the City,",5,2016,09,14
30,Amazing experience!,My husband and I went to this hotel and had a great experience. It's clean and stylish with professional staff. We spent a good amount of time in the bar because it is quite far from the center and at night theres not much open in the area. The bartender Marco was really professional and made us great drinks. My husband and I don't speak Spanish very well which was not a problem here. He spoke English perfectly which was really helpful. We had great cocktails and had a good conversation about cultural things in Barcelona. The reception staff was also very welcoming and knowledgeable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for quality without having to pay too much.,5,2016,09,14
30,Most glamorous hotel I have ever stayed in,"We were greeted with excellent service as soon as we arrived. The lobby was amazing the lifts were hi-tec, the room was gorgeous with the most amazing view of the city of Barcelona with the sea in the background. The room was fitted with air con, mini bar, flat screen TV, I pod dock and a safe. The maid service was sublime they have a real keen eye for detail when it came to the little things. We went to the restaurant on the second floor for my birthday the service was top class, the food was delicious and very well priced I had the pork and my partner had the lamb they were both gorgeous and looked very pretty. When I got back from my day out on my birthday I was received with a free desert with a candle in it a free bottle of water and a happy birthday note from the hotel. The hotel offered free trips in to the beach and a free shuffle to and from the airport, if you prefer getting your self about there is a motro close by and its easy to use and is cheap it's about ‚Ç¨20 for 3days for one person. This was the most amazing stay in a hotel we have ever had, we much appreciated everything and would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,09,14
30,Great location for combining Sightseeing and Beachdays!!!,"We spent a week in one of the apartments from the Fira Suits, which is directly next to the Hesperia Tower and belongs to the Hotel. The apartment was quite nice and very clean. Apparently we had to call the reception twice, because however the description said ""fully equipped kitchen"" there were no pots, pans, cutting boards or sharp knifes, which made it first impossible for us to cook. (Keep in mind that there is nothing in the kitchen, so if you want to be prepared bring pepper, salt, and stuff like this). We really enjoyed the fact, that there was room service every day. One could choose whether to get new towels and they also prepared the bed. 
Also the locations was very good for our type of holiday. Thanks to the free shuttle service from the Hotel (they bring you to the city center in 20 minutes, also to the airport and based on the season to a really nice beach), the metro station right in front of the hotel and a bus stop, we were able to reach the city center and also the beach within 20 min. We really appreciated this. 
There was also a negative aspect: Every time we entered the room, their was a disgusting smell, maybe from the air conditioning, which would not go away at all. Also our balcony was compared to the room itself not so clean.

However we would definitely recommend the Fira Suits if you want to combine a city trip with beach holiday.",4,2016,09,12
30,Fab Hotel,"Son and his partner stayed here on 10/8 for 3 nights and are still raving about it. 
Staff are very helpful and directed them to all the things they needed.
The room are spotless and showers are amazing 
There is a transport into the city only 5 min walk away.
Would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2016,09,11
30,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel, a fair way out but easy to acess city via the underground which is situated 200 metres from the hotel. Carpets need upgrading. Restaurant was beautiful and lucky it was as theres no other places to eat in walking distance. After a long day of traveling it was a shame to find out we had to pay an additional 12euro to use the spa/pool. Overall a comfortable stay. ",4,2016,09,10
30,Lovely hotel close to the underground,"A lovely hotel, with many luxurious features despite us using only a few.
Staff on reception were helpful and attentive, and the shuttle service they provided was perfect for getting into the city centre/airport.
Only a short way away from the underground metro, the perfect place to stay if you're looking for somewhere outside of the city centre.
Would definitely come back again",4,2016,09,10
30,Nice hotel to end a 10 day trip ,"We started in France and have been stopping at hotels through the south of France and ending in Barcelona. Beautiful rooms with a view. Staff seems to be helpful. Will share more the longer we stay.
We will try the breakfast in the morning before we finish our touring tomorrow.",4,2016,09,09
30,Not quite as advertised,"Beautiful hotel.  Advertised airport shuttle.  No shuttle between 11 am and 4:40 pm or before 7 am in the morning.  Arrived at airport at 1:30 pm and had to take a 25 euro taxi to hotel.  Pool, if you pay 12 euros a day, you can use the pool. For such a lovely hotel, it left me very disappointed.",2,2016,09,06
30,A fabulous hotel!!!,"Excellent!!! This hotel is so beautiful and luxurious. The rooms are nicely decorated and welcoming with a great view. We only intended on staying one night but everything was so pleasant that we stayed an additional night. We ordered dinner one night and the portion size was filling. The bartender made 'GREAT' drinks. We also order breakfast one morning and that was good as well. The neighborhood is full of culture and shops within walking distance. Great location.  
",5,2016,09,05
30,nasty,"How do you explain room service walking in at 8pm unannounced? Three attempts to provide an acceptable room, which stuck of cigarettes. Room key not working on numerous nights. Let's just say my next stay in Barcelona will not be here",1,2016,09,01
30,The spa is a must!,"We needed to stay in Barcelona for 2 nights prior to our cruise. This hotel came up if sorted by stars, it is close to the airport and the harbour so I went ahead and booked 2 rooms. One for my in-laws and one for my husband, my 5yo daughter and I. 
I was then contacted that if there is going to be 3 people in the room I have to upgrade to a suite a the cost of roughly 55 EUR a night. As I had no option, I agreed. 
The hotel is at the end of the world so to speak, or literally at the end of L1 metro line which was fine. 
The hotel itself is very nice, especially the reception. The rooms are ok, not brand new anymore, but ok. We stayed on 11th and 14th floors, nice views. Our suite had a very large bathroom plus another room where there was a sofa bed for my little one. It was not done up so we had to call downstairs, however, within minutes there was someone there. The main bed was big and very comfortable. 
The very lovely bonus was that the suite came with free access into the gym/spa area Metropolitan. I had a few lengths in the nearly empty pool every evening, we went into jacuzzi, sauna, rubbed myself in ice after. It was heavenly after the sightseeing all day! From now on, spa will be a deciding factor when booking a hotel.
An extra star is being earned by the staff whom I kindly asked (OK, begged) to send a postcard for me back home as did not have time to do it myself. They did not provide the service but after some persuasion they agreed and my parents got our postcard recently which I was very happy about. 
All in all, I would book and stay here again.",5,2016,08,31
30,First class hotel,"The reception staff were very helpful and friendly from the day we arrived until our departure. We booked one of the superior rooms, and the room were very airy, clean and tidy.The superior room gave us access to the Tower Room. The breakfast was excellent everyday with a variety of  foods to cater for different clients. What I would say though that the hotel was lacking in restaurants for evening meals. The caf√© bar food was very expensive, therefore restaurants menus would be offering cheaper menus would be advantageous. If we visit Barcelona again, we would certainly use this hotel again.",5,2016,08,30
30,Lovely hotel,"Such an easy going hotel, really good for a city break! Just want you want in a hotel, would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who goes to Barcelona for a trip.
The rooms were absolutely spotless and the staff were very welcoming! ",5,2016,08,30
30,Stayed 2 nights pre-cruise,This hotel is near the airport. Nothing really in walking distance. We took a taxi twice to the Gran Via 2 mall. Nice mall and close to the hotel. The room was small but nice. The ac worked great! No ac in hallways. Very warm in hallways. Food was a bit pricey so we ate at the mall. Will stay again.,5,2016,08,30
30,I cant recommend this highly Hotel highly enough!,"Value for money this is an exceptional hotel and the staff are second to none, great free shuttle service to the air port and the beach. I would stay now where else in Barcelona. I especial loved the view from the 17 floor full wall window.",5,2016,08,30
30,Fantastic hotel,"We have been staying in the hotel next to this big one, the Hotel Fira Suites, but, these 2 hotels share all services, including breakfast that is served in the Tower. We want to write a comment anyhow because we have been their guests during breakfast time as well as for one dinner in restaurant on second floor. The place is worthied to see. Spectacular facilities with great service staff",5,2016,08,28
30,"""Excellent Hotel""","Definitely would recommend the Hesperia, good location with metro nearby. Hotel provides free shuttle service from the airport and also to La Rambles. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable, best shower ever. Staff was excellent. Sebastiano at the restaurant was very helpful and provided us with information on local sites to visit. Nico at the front desk and Alberto the driver were great. The restaurant food was well prepared and delicious, servers were knowledgeable and attentive.",5,2016,08,27
30,Amazing Stay,"The hotel is absolutely amazing, everything is cleaned to the highest standard, the rooms are beautiful and the view is insane. 
The first thing you see when you walk in is the beautiful bathroom ( the shower is incredible especially due to the jets).
The beds are very comfy as well, our stay has been fantastic and the hotel staff are friendly and accommodating ",5,2016,08,25
30,Daves 50tj Barcelona,"Great hotel, friendly bar staff, breakfast good value & choice. Will need to use either metro very close or taxi to get to centre. Hotel offers some shuttle services to city centre and airport. Plenty to do in Barcelona, would recommend city tours",5,2016,08,23
30,Nice property close to the airport,"Two recent stays, unfortunately for business. This is a nice property not too far from the airport in the medical district. In fact, from the higher floors, you get a direct view of the harbor and the airport.

Room was very nice, got an upgrade to a small suite on my second visit. My only quibble with the room was the heavy design - dark wood everywhere, a bit old fashioned for my taste. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well as well - critical in the summer. Internet connectivity was ok, some speed drop at times but good enough to work.

I wasn't too impressed with the dinner choices and preferred to go out. Breakfast however was excellent with good choices at the buffet.",4,2016,08,21
30,Remarkable hotel and front desk team,Special thanks to Miquel from the front desk at night shift. This remarkable professional made our stay memorable! Highly educated and very classy staff! Very nice hotel and good breakfast! Housekeeping is the worst which makes a lot of damage of the hotel prestige! ,5,2016,08,21
30,Mediocre-don't expect more than depressing airport hotel,"Based on other reviews we thought this would be nice/not depressing airport hotel. Definitely not 5 star hotel as billed. Not even close. The rooftop bar, which was a major draw, was closed without explanation when we were there. So was one of the restaurants. The staff was friendly but overall the place felt run down and past its prime. Even though we had an early flight, it would have been much better to hop into Barcelona proper for the night. ",2,2016,08,15
30,Hesperia tower hotel ,"My boyfriend and I went to Barcelona and stayed in the Hesperia Tower for a week. Upon our arrival at the airport we were picked up by the hotel's free transfer service. This service did not stop at the airport, there are transfers several times a day to the beach and the centre of Barcelona which was fantastic and free! However, with only 13 spaces on the shuttle available occasionally we missed out on getting the free transfer but just used the metro which was cheap and 2 minutes away from the hotel. 
The staff were very friendly and the hotel room was perfectly clean. We had trouble with our shower as it leaked and when we notified the staff about this, they immediately sorted it out. The room was cleaned daily, making the hotel a wonderful retreat after a long day and evening in Barcelona. 
The hotel is in a perfect location, with 2 metro stations, a bar, a small supermarket and some restaurants and only 20 minutes drive/metro away from the beach and centre. 
We were very happy with our stay and would recommend it to couples who want to enjoy a well worth the money stay in a friendly and welcoming hotel. ",4,2016,08,15
30,Amazing Bar Experience,"Trendy hotel decor and very friendly staff. This hotel has a unique design with lots of natural light and really cool furniture. Staff members are very nice and seem genuine. We had a lovely experience in the lobby bar although it was very cold. The bar man Marco was extremely friendly and showed a real passion for his craft.  My friends had sangria which was amazing. In some bars in Barcelona the sangria can be made very quickly and without fresh ingredients. But the one they had was full of flavor and very authentic. I was looking for a healthier option so Marco suggested a smoothie. I asked if the ingredients were fresh and he showed me the crates of fresh fruits and vegetables. He suggested an apple, avocado and lime smoothie. It was absolutely delicious! As much as we love Barcelona, the service can be a bit disappointing in some restaurants and bars. Our experience in this bar was lovely because not only did we have great drinks but also a great conversation with Marco. He gave us tips on where to go and what to see as well as what things not to waste our time on. This hotel is simply lovely. We hope everyone has an experience as good as ours.",5,2016,08,14
30,Go for a Top Floor with Views of the City,"We were on the 24th floor overlooking Barcelona so of course this was amazing.  The view was inspiring, and a bit stomach turning cause it was so high.  The room was huge as well.  The hotel is close to the airport but is a way in for sight seeing.",5,2016,08,13
30,Would stay here again,"We stayed here for 4 nights in July. Originally booked it as we were impressed by the viewing restaurant but disappointed to find out after booking that this is now closed for regular guests to dine at! Well located just 25 mins metro ride from city centre or there else a free shuttle (on a timetable). Rooms were spacious and clean. We were very lucky with a city view on level 22... Wow! There was a big delay on a pre-ordered room service on my birthday but the restaurant and staff more than made up for the error, which was very kind! Also a lovely surprise birthday cake left in the room from the hotel! Great service in the restaurant and lovely staff! Disappointed only one visit to the spa was included, it wasn't clear it would cost extra when booking, which was a shame. All in all a good stay as I'd recommend this hotel.",4,2016,08,10
30,Excellent ,If you need a one night stay in BCN because you have an early flight the next day this is the best hotel.  Modern hotel with all the amenities of a 4/5 star hotel.  We got upgraded to a two floor suite which was pretty awesome.  The wifi is free and the breakfast is great.  Great value as well the prices are not huge. I also emailed with them requesting and early check in and the did reply and provided us with this.  Beds are great.  ,5,2016,08,10
30,Nice hotel,"Stayed in this hotel whilst on a business trip close by.
Hotel rooms are very nice with plenty of space and beautiful bathroom, my only complaint being that the shower was a little on the cold side every morning.
The hotel is a little outside Barcelona but there is a Metro station within five minutes walk that will get you to Las Ramblas in ~15 minutes. Taxi back was only around ‚Ç¨8 too.",4,2016,08,09
30,Amazing worth the money! ,"me and my friend stayed in this hotel for 6 nights 1-6
Aug the most amazing 6 nights the staff the rooms people in the hotel were very welcoming and friendly, anyone saying this is not a 5 star hotel are definitely being stuck up and being picky this hotel was amazing the room was spotless the maids cleaned every day! the view from our room was beautiful 10 minutes from las ramblas taxi is 13 euro or the 94,95 bus goes to la ramblas (the centre) for. 2.15 euro it's not that far it's certainly not 25 minutes as I read bellow the beach is a 20 minute bus ride also 2.15 euro definitely worth it as taxis can be expensive, going Barcelona next year and would stay here again 1000000 percent Loved my stay. ",5,2016,08,09
30,Definitely not 5 star,We stayed at the Hesperia for only 1 night but that was enough. This is definitely not a 5 star hotel as billed. Rooms were shabby and dated. Our bathroom shower was moldy and the bed linens were scratchy and uncomfortable. Also agree with other reviewers that this hotel is far from restaurants and other sites. Though our family did walk around and found a fantastic pizza spot about 10 mins away.,2,2016,08,08
30,Beautiful Hotel turned ugly by staff.,"A group of us stayed here in early Aug 2016. Rooms are very nice, spacious and nice complimentary offerings provided (plenty of water, coffee, snacks and toiletries) - but that's something i would expect from a hotel claiming to be 5 anyway*. 

We arrived at midday and were checked in very late, initially told 3pm, To make up the waiting time, we went around and visited the surrounding areas and head back around 4pm, unfortunately we were still made to wait until 5.30pm!!!.- no apologies provided and not a single hint of a gesture of good will. We instantly knew from this, this hotel does not care for its customers.

As lead passenger i dealt with all enquiries, and would often find myself waiting lengthy times at the front desk, while few staff would be casually hovering around the side staff room nearby,. The level of service throughout the two night stay was shocking. 

upon checking-in 1 of our 4 rooms had a leaking bathroom light - we were told its ok and maintenance would be down shortly to fix it - no one came even after numerous calls and visits to the front desk. The only time they came up with a resolution was when one of the members was in the room and there was a electricity blackout (around 10pm). It was only then they moved they members to a higher room. - Once again no apology given by a member of staff.

Our second day at the hotel was a lot more flexible since we avoided staff contact where possible. and spent most of our time in Catalunya which is 25mins train journey from the nearby station. Unfortunately the spa is NOT included in your hotel stay, you must pay 12euros per person, per day. unacceptable for a hotel claiming to be 5star. 

The surrounding areas were really nice, its a residential area and the local restaurants and corner shops are very good value for money. e.g a can of soft drink will cost you 0.5euros, compared to 1.5-3 euros you will find in a lot of restaurants/shops the more you go towards central.. 

While the second day was alot more hassle free, we feared what check out would be like and we could not be more wrong. In the evening of our last stay we kindly asked if they could provide us a late checkout since our transfer to airport was at 4pm, this was refused even-though we stated that surely there is something they can do since we were checked-in very very late. They took no notice, especially Marial - a female member of the front desk team, she started to raise her voice very loudly and attempted to talk down at us and trying to get us to walk away from the desk, even-though there were no customers waiting behind us. When we returned to our room, she did eventually call back and offered us an hour free checkout (1pm) but as you can guess, no apology given.

On checkout the gentlemen taking care of our suitcases was very friendly and polite. 

Unfortunately Miquel - the staff member who processed our check-out couldn't have been more irresponsible and rude and an attempted thief. We were charged a city tax, of 2.25 euros per person per day, and at first he stated the total comes to 30 euros, and repeated this several times. While i put the money on the desk, he said its 45, yet i said, you just stated 30, and he point blank rejected that he had said 30 euros. I couldn't believe how untrustworthy one person can get especially member of staff at a 5* hotel. I challenged this and he still refused to admit he said 30 euros. The service here was simply despicable. He then proceeded to check us out by printing out a receipt and stumping it on the desk and walking away. No good bye, no pleasures. Nothing. 

A few people have refrained from mentioning a shocking staff members name, but i can probably guess who it is; Miquel.

I'd stay here again for the room and the modern feel, but only once they install automated check in/check out systems because the level of service was poor.",1,2016,08,08
30,Great night staff,"Arrived from the airport at 1:30 am (15 min drive by taxi), exhausted and angry about the delay of your flight.
Javier, one of the night staffer, was wonderful: professionnal, helpful and efficient. He also was the one to make the wake up call as planned.
We used the free shuttle to get back to the airport in the morning (7 am). The driver asked which company we were using, so he parked close to the gates and told us where to go.

Hotel room was exactly as advertised, beautiful view if you are on a high floor.
Great hotel for an early flight from Barcelona. ",4,2016,08,08
30,Disappointing!! Not 5 Star Standard,"I would like to make it clear to other travellers that although this hotel deems itself 5 stars, it is in actual fact far from it. I usually like to begin with some positive points, I honestly find it difficult relating to many positives apart from the bar man who was very friendly and welcoming on several occasions. 

However, it is important to outline what to expect for other people travelling and thinking about booking this hotel. 

Location: Unless you are prepared to travel 25-30mins on a tram each time you want to go for food then this is not ideal. On a brighter note there is a free shuttle service with fantastic, informative drivers, but what we didn't realise is that it only takes the first 13 people. First come, first served basis. Make sure you line up early!

The hotel itself was disappointing in several aspects. I'm assuming the hotel can declare itself 5 star due to having a Spa. BUT please realise this is not included in your 5 star stay. It is a Spa which is not specifically owned by the hotel and is open to members of the public. It is a supplemented price if you intend using it on a daily basis. The food/drink prices are extortionate including breakfast.  

The room was a bit of a let down and was not overly clean. To be honest, we thought judging by first impressions in the lobby, the rooms would be immaculate. This was not the case. The carpet was disgusting, we had to ask the cleaner to clean the dirty brown marks off it as soon as we arrived in case we were penalised. In fact, we asked to be upgraded as we were quite unhappy and as the hotel was dead (there were very little people staying only to be told it would be ¬£55 extra per night). We decided against spending any more money in the hotel.

Several members of staff could do with re-training on customer service/ communication skills. One male in particular, (I will not mention his name) did not provide service that we would have expected in a 5 star. 

Finally, if you do not like heights it's probably sensible to steer clear. 

Overall, we were very disappointed with the level or service we received and the hotel was dead for July. There was a very poor atmosphere about the place.",2,2016,08,07
30,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff and very close transport links!!","I was taken on a surprise birthday trip to Barcelona and stayed in this beautiful hotel. The hotel is out of the way of the city but has a train station less than 5 mins away. Placa de Catalunya is no more than 20mins away by train or the hotel has a shuttle that takes you there at certain times for free. We had the Barcelona BCN cards so we were wizzing around the city!! The hotel is very clean and modern, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. There is free wifi all around the hotel which is great when your in your room and what to update your family/friends on your travels. 
As it was my birthday the hotel picked this up and left a lovely birthday treat for me in my room which was an extra special touch. It shows that they are attentive to their customers and it made me feel even more welcomed by the hotel. 
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel and the view from my room was remarkable. 22nd floor, I could see half of Barcelona, it was amazing, especially the sunrise! 
The room had a lot of luxury amenities which was perfectly added. I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend staying here. If I am in Barcelona anytime soon I will be back at this hotel.

A big thank you to the staff for being so welcoming and providing such a lovely gesture. 
A massive thank you to Diego for helping me to receive my item of jewellery which I left in the hotel. I couldn't be more grateful for the lovely experience at the hotel. Made my birthday extra special.",5,2016,08,07
30,Great stay,"Such a lovely hotel. Room was clean and shower was amazing. The view from our room was incredible, however the location was a little far but it was an easy train ride to the city which took about 25 minutes. The hotel shuttle is also very convenient and it was free so worked out well. Staff were friendly and helpful. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,08,06
30,The good and the not so good ,"The good:
Beautiful clean modern hotel.  Relaxed atmosphere and close to the Airport.  
Managed to get the free shuttle back to the airport which was very handy.  

Room was to a high standard, good air con and maid service top notch.  Fab power shower. 

Hotel is on the outskirts next to a large teaching hospital.  Tube station 5 mins walk into hospital grounds.  Thats handy because you can access all the main attractions by tube and its quite cheap travel.  

Hotel is in a residential area.  It looks a little intimidating but don't be put off.  We ate out with the locals every night and were made very welcome.  Food and drinks very reasonable.  Eg Dinner with 6 beers ‚Ç¨15.  
Never had any hassle.  A very family orientated community which was a pleasure to share time with. 

Not so good:
Hotel restaurant did not appeal.  Difficult to get any service, food choice poor and expensive.   It might appeal to some but not to our taste and we are fairly easy to please.  

Reception staff seemed to have little time for the average Joe.  Couldn't do enough for the local pilots and air crewe.  I guess thats where their income is.   

It wouldn't take much for this to be a really great hotel: as in all things in life thats down to how you make people feel.  

Overall I would still recommend the hotel and would stay again.  

",4,2016,08,06
30,Well below 5 star standard,"I stayed here with my wife for 4 nights in August. Room 1305

The lobby and communal areas were immaculate and so we had high hopes. However things went down hill from there.

First of all our safe didn't work. Not a big problem and sorted the next day.

The condition of the room was well below the standard we expected. The carpet was frayed where it met the tiled bathroom floor and absolutely filthy. In the bathroom we found that the mirror was badly cracked in the wardrobe and towel hooks were hanging off. We also had damaged furniture in the bedroom also veneer missing from units and generally worn.

The so called trendy mags as advertised on the website were ov a yr old.

The thing we found woefully poor was the standard of service and cleaning. Every morning we left our towels in the shower as requested and they were either not changed or not replaced. We complained about this every night or requested additional items which were not always supplied. On one evening my wife found a toilet roll in the toilet which she had to fish out.
The bins were not emptied on more than one occasion.

When we checked out I was asked if we had a good stay. When I pointed out the shortcomings all I got was a condescending smirk and a shrug of the shoulders.

The hotel is a fair way from the city centre but a complementary shuttle service supplied throughout the day to various points which is excellent. The driver was very skilled, smooth and polite.

Other reviews have mentioned that the is no food or amenities nr by. Not true whilst there isn't much there are a couple of small supermarkets, bars and restaurants within 10 minutes walk. The area is not great but we had no problems and we liked the community atmosphere with kids playing as well as young and old catching up for a good ole fashioned chin wag

In conclusion I would not stay here again and we felt disappointed. We usually stay in cheaper hotels but decided to treat our selves on this occasion using a windfall we had on the grand national.",3,2016,08,05
30,Beautiful Barcelona,"We stayed two nights at the Hesperia Tower: at the beginning of our cruise and at the end. Both nights saw us upgraded to the 25th floor that were composed of incredible two-story bedroom suites. Floor to ceiling windows overlooked the city and the second floor housed the bed, ensuite bathroom area, and a huge jacuzzi tub located under massive windows which also overlooked the city. The views and condition of the room were beyond beautiful. They were breath-taking!
The hotel is a large convention centre, but a definite perk to the 25th floor is having free access to the Tower Club on the 5th floor where unlimited snacks, drinks (including alcohol), and plush resting couches, tables, and chairs are provided. Being a 25th floor guest also allows you free access to the adjoint health club and fitness centre which defines world class. It is incredible.",4,2016,08,05
30,Luxurious hotel,"I stayed 4 nights for a conference. The hotel is really nice, glass everywhere, polished marble, chrome, soft carpets etc. The air conditioning can be regulated well and it is quiet. The conference room was fine - good acoustics, lightning, overhead projector and fresh air.

I loved the breakfast - well prepared, fresh food, wide choice, plenty of everything. The only problem is elevators which get crowded and they are really slow around breakfast time. The serving hours are comfortably long though. I can't say about other meals because we skipped them for eating downtown.

The hotel is located very near to the airport, just two bus stops far from terminal 2 (BCN) or a few minutes by taxi (that should cost 20‚Ç¨). But it is quite far from the city center (around 35mins by the underground). To avoid a tedious and long journey to Park Guell we used a taxi, that cost 20 ‚Ç¨ as well.

The hotel itself is nice but view from the hotel is lacking. If you are lucky your view will be suburbian part of Barcelona (+ a few skyscrapers). If you are less lucky your view will be docks and an industrial part of the city.

I didn't like the bar services (we used the one in the lobby) because it was such a rip off. 5  ‚Ç¨ for a 3dcl beer might seem okay to some but 2dcl water for the same amount seems unreasonable to me. 

Fortunately there is a small supermarket, bakery and a small stand in the park serving snacks and drinks cheaply. The owner can even speak English and is rather helpful.

The hotel staff is polite and generally helpful. No major complaints there.

Overall a pleasant experience. You get what you pay for.",4,2016,08,04
30,Stunning hotel ,"Excellent service that you would expect in a premium, city hotel. Excellent transport links for getting into city if you are using public transport. Easy to get a car with no additional fees for hotel sourcing. Great experience in a duplex suite with a beautiful view of, everything!!",5,2016,08,03
30,Excellent Stay,"We stayed 5 nights, as a couple, and had a wonderful time in Barcelona. We had a small blip to start with when we arrived a bit before check-in and were told a room wasn't ready yet by a disinterested front desk clerk who wasn't very talkative, but we left our bags and came back a couple of hours later, and from that point onwards our experience was fantastic. We were checked-in and looked after by Mikel who was extremely friendly and very attentive. We stayed in an incredible room, spread over two floors with a jacuzzi bath and amazing views out over Barcelona, from El Tibidabo to the Olympic Park. Room was spacious, modern and clean. Bed was large and very comfortable. WiFi was free. We didn't use the gym / pool though as it was more than ‚Ç¨12 per person / per use and you needed to have (or purchase) a swimming hat - wasn't an issue for us as we were out most the time, but may be for others. There was a free transport shuttle to / from Catalunya and the Airport during the day, and the hotel is 5 minutes walk from the end of the L1 metro line. We just got a 5 day travel pass and used the metro most days (takes about 25 minutes to get to Catalunya). To and from the airport took us about 15 minutes max and costs ‚Ç¨20 by taxi each way. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on food. Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a modern, high-quality place to stay, just be aware that it does take a while to get to the tourist areas (you can't just pop out - there is a small store, bank and bakery the other side of the Media Markt if you need some supplies, but that's about it in the local area), though for what we paid against the experience we had, it was very much worth it (we found a great deal online) - we had a super stay!",5,2016,07,29
30,One Night Stay,Group of 18 stay at the hotel for one day cause we was going on a cruise the next day. The stay was great.   We walked around the neighborhood and the people were very helpful recommending restaurants to eat.  The Hesperia Tower itself was very relaxing. We ended up eating in their restaurant and the food was delicious. The menu was in English as well as Spanish.  The entertainment was very soothing.  It was opera.  The chef came out and song then a waiter and finally a female. Fantastic place.,5,2016,07,29
30,A bit disappointing,"This hotel has seen better days.  It bills itself as 5* but is more of a 3 - 4 *.  The decor is getting tired and tatty.  Staff are pleasant but not consistently helpful.  Didn't give us a welcome drink and didn't tell us about their bus into Barcelona.  We had bought 3 day metro tickets before we found out.  Metro is 5 minute walk and at the end of the line.  Shower in our room had a mouldy ceiling and water leaked into the WC, electric curtains didn't work and there was a light bulb not working. However, had a lovely, if overly expensive, meal in the Bouquet Restaurant where our waiter was great.  Breakfast very good choice but baked beans mixed with rice, ""Unacceptable! Who does that?"", (16 year old offspring). Most disappointing thing was that despite photo of pool and gym featuring heavily on their website, it is not free to residents.  It is 12E to use it per person and no under 16s - so not a hotel for families. Supposed to be a room with a view -  view of hospital and motorway.  Also on website shows al fresco eating on a terrace, which was closed, and a dome restaurant at top of building, which was also closed.",3,2016,07,29
30,Stopover between flights.,"We are currently at the Hesperia Towers. After flying for the past 25 hours we were looking forward to relaxing with the kids by the pool for the day, only to find upon arriving that it is an adults only pool. This was our main reason for choosing this hotel, so not impressed! 

Otherwise, this is a lovely hotel. Breakfast was excellent, as were the wait staff. The Hotel is 5 minutes from the airport and they gave us an early check in. Bathroom and shower are great, the beds and pillows comfy and the rooms quiet. 

Only other downside is there are no coffee/tea facilities in the room.",4,2016,07,29
30,perfect!,"Hotel has 3free  transfers till 8 p. m.- to center, pl.catalonia, to the airport, to the beach. 20 min from airport. panoramic view. shower with massage. big bathroom. i liked. bed very comfortable. in bar works very kindly barmen)",5,2016,07,28
30,Birthday weekend in Barcelona,Great weekend.... wonderful staff... superbe restaurant... 10 min. from airport by bus... 20 min. into Pla√ßa da Cataluyns by metro. 15 min from Gava beach... couldn't wish for more!! Plus had a surprise mini birthday cake surprise on the return from the beach!!,5,2016,07,26
30,Good hotel,We were pleased to be check in at 11.30 and to have free transportation to the center of Barcelona. Good restaurants but the price is very high for Barcelona. And there is nowhere to go nearby! But it has free bus to the Airport. And a nice view from 29-th level!,4,2016,07,26
30,Great hotel,"I was there at a conference for 3 nights and the hotel was excellent, but I expected that for the price I paid. The breakfast was ok, but a bit disorganized and a little chaotic too maybe they weren't used to so many people. Staff was friendly but looked overwhelmed.
It has 4 restaurants, but only 2 are open and at night only the most expensive is open. This could be a problem because there aren't any nice restaurant around the area, and the area itself s a bit rough in my opinion ( I traveled alone) Like any expensive restaurant, price were too high, the food delicious but very little on the plate.
There is a metro station close and the hotel has shuttles to the city in the morning and in afternoon (nothing at siesta time). It is kind of far from the city though, but close to the airport, just take a taxi or find out about their shuttle.",4,2016,07,25
30,The suites rooms are superb,"Had low expectations going in, as the hotel room part of a conference booking. The hotel advised us on what bus number to catch from the airport (had come in from Sydney Australia) as their shuttle doesn't run after 8pm and we got in around 10pm. Found bus with Eas and was 4 euro each as advised. Showed the driver our address and after around 20minutes he stopped and nodded that this was our stop. Hotel was across the road (using an underpass) and around the corner.
Upon entry, the place was stunning. All black tiles and light filled spaces (especially in the daytime). Massive lounge seating but with dividers scattered throughout main foyer area as well as a bar with bar snacks available gratis throughout day (fruit and dry snacks, sometimes cheese). Turned out we had been upgraded to a suite (thanks conference organisers - was not the standard room). 
Was just a case of 'oh my goodness' when we walked in. So much space (even for a suite). Ample hanging space and coat hangers. Comfortable king bed, luxurious doona covers and pillows. The bathroom had a bath (with spa) so long that even more sixfoot4 mister could comfortable recline. 
Even water temps unaffected by other guests, dual wash basins and two toilets! 
Fabulous. 
The block out drapes were controlled electronically by a switch on the wall and were very effective. 
The bar fridge tiny with no ice-making facility but an ice bucket supplied in room. Being a suite there was also a complimentary glass bottle of still water supplied daily. Plus the standard kettle, tea and coffee.
The only negatives was constantly having to ask for two sachets of coffee be supplied daily instead of one decaf and one normal; the body wash and lotio not being replenished daily (having to request); no face washers at all; the absence of a detailed compendium stating things such as where to obtain ice (the bar on main foyer - room service will readily supply but that will be 5 euros thanks!); an ironing board and iron (from reception not housekeeping); and no ability to use the stairs to get between floors - all lift-based and one lift, number 2 persistently got stuck at our floor with the doors opening and then unable to close and the way it's set up, no other lift will stop at that floor unless disembarking passengers because the system already shows there is a lift there. 
Whilst the metro stop is at the end of the line, it was still massively convenient to get everywhere using a 3 day metro pass. The station is around 200m away plus buses at door if preferring to use those. There was a also a regular shuttle into the centre of Barcelona but this was on a first come, first served - same with airport shuttle, so you do need to go and stand at the stop in advance.
There are superb eating places within a two block radius - superb being defined as eating what the locals eat - so lots of seafood (mussels steamed in a wine sauce - a favourite) salad, bread, meats etc. Unfortunately TripAdvisor site unable to locate some of the places so we could not post recommendations there but most places are around 26 euro for two people consuming 5 tapas (shared) and 2 glasses of wine each - it doesn't help to ask the staff as they do not appear to know their own suburb! Plus there are two supermarkets also within the two block radius with very inexpensive wine and beers and an amazing array of fresh fruit, veg, breads, etc.",5,2016,07,23
30,Definitely a 5 star!,"Just came back from staying here for my boyfriends 24th birthday for 3 nights. 
On arrival we had to wait an hour for our room, spoke to a man named Rodger. Came back after an hour and a lady told us we would have to wait longer, we spoke to the guy again and he said we have a room which is not what you paid for, we then got upgraded to a suite! It was absolutely amazing definitely recommend paying extra for. But an unexpected surprise due to the waiting around - he must have felt sorry for us.
The maids were good and also left a surprise birthday cake and note for my boyfriend on his birthday which was lovely!
We weren't told any info when checking in due to having to wait for a room, so we didn't know until checking out that there is a free shuttle service into the city (las rambles) and the nearby beach etc, at different times each day. This could have saved us some money as we travelled to the city every day from the bus stop outside the hotel for 2.15 euros each way each time per person.
Staff are lovely, only thing is electric curtains didn't work.
Also the bath and shower are lovely, missing the hotel already :(",5,2016,07,22
30,"Good quality hotel, not too far from airport","We are staying here for a few days  visiting the city. It's about a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport. The staff on arrival in reception were friendly and helpful and found us a room early even before official check in to e. The room is good with a great bathroom and dressing area. The hotel has a gym and spa which can be used by guests for 12 euros a say. Shame the pool is only inside as there's a sun lounge area adjacent to the pool  and it's just too hot for an inside swim.  The hotel operate a courtesy lift to the city and to the airport but not that regularly. I would like it if it was hourly. The metro is a very short walk away but it's a good 20 minutes into the centre which is fine but a trek if you want to go back into the centre for an evening meal. There's not much close to the hotel at all. In July the metro was really hot but thank goodness the trains run very punctually , and are air conditioned.",4,2016,07,21
30,"It was ok, but not as 5* hotel","The rooms were big and clean! I didn't know that you have to pay for spa if you are on a bottom floor. I thought 5* hotel should have entrance to the spa for everyone. Location was really not the best. Staff at reception didn't know a lot info about Barcelona, which I think is a bit weird. I had to ask them and drag information out from them. 

",4,2016,07,21
30,Super,"Super hotel , Good location, good shuttle service and nice gym and pool.
Breakfast buffet on 4 th floor was excellent 
We were upgraded to a suite on the 16 floor. We where on our way to the cruiseship and this location is perfect ",5,2016,07,20
30,Excellent hotel away from the bustle of Barcelona,"This was my second stay here and I chose it mainly for the location. I was travelling on my own and I don't think Barcelona is the safest city in the world. 
The hotel is out of town with an excellent shuttle bus into town and is also located close to the Metro station.
Although I was early, the staff checked me into a fabulous room.
I cannot fault the helpfulness and friendliness of all of the staff.
I highly recommend the bar by the foyer which does the best Gin and Tonics ever. 
Room service was fast and very tasty and also well priced. I chose this option due to sheer idleness and a love of eating in bed!
Thank you and I look forward to staying here again soon",5,2016,07,19
30,Brilliant hotel in an excellent location!,"We booked this hotel as a ""top secret"" on LastMinute. When we arrived we were very pleasantly surprised! The hotel is amazing! Great service, location & rooms!

The finish on the rooms is more than what you would expect in a hotel! The room service was mind blowing and very reasonably priced! Just behind the hotel are some local shops which have everything a traveller would need! By far the best shop is a Kebab house, never had kebab like it! 

The hotel lobby has a cocktail bar which is outstanding! Nothing was too much trouble!

The location doesn't look ideal but next to the hotel is a tube station and every tourist attraction we wanted to see was easily accessible. The area of the hotel is quiet & clean.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone!",5,2016,07,17
30,Fantastic service!,"From the moment we arrived at Hesperia Tower the service was incredible, very friendly and helpful staff and an introduction and personal greeting from the manager. The room was spotless and had a wonderful view of Barcelona.
We felt like we had hit the jackpot as we also recieved a room upgrade and a late checkout! Thanks Hesperia Tower great service.
The Hotel is close to the airport; 20 mins and 2 euros on the bus and stops very close to Hesperia Tower, there is a complimentray shuttle at the hotel that runs to a timetable. The metro is a 5 minute walk from the Hotel and around a 30-40 minute journey to central Barcelona. A 10 trip concession card is less than 10 euros. 
I would recommend this hotel for it's central location and excellent service.",5,2016,07,15
30,Great night to remember ,Very good way to finish of our vacation in Spain the room was very good after a long journey from Valencia the Bouquet restaurant served up a excellent meal first class quality at  the axis bar bar tenders where very friendly and service was excellent a great experience enjoyed by all ,5,2016,07,14
30,"4*, not 5*.","A little shabby around the edges, with an ambitious lift call system, it does have an impressive foyer. The rooms are quite nice, with everything you would normally expect.

My complaint is that there is no gym or swimming pool as part of the hotel, although for 14 euros a day (12.50 for entrance and 1.50 for flip flops) you can access the private gym next door. 5*? I expect a free pool.",3,2016,07,14
30,Lovely hotel,"Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights in June 2016 and we would definitely return in the future if we head back to Barcelona. Our room was upgraded and we were put on the 18th floor which gave us spectacular views of Barcelona. We could even see the Sagrada Famalia in the distance, and despite having a main road next to the hotel we could hear nothing. The room was lovely, very clean and had everything we needed, including tea/coffee facilities and a bottle of water was placed in the room everyday. Because this hotel isn't in the city centre we bought a T10 metro card each as there's a metro station at the hospital across from the hotel which is about a 2 minute walk and it was easy to get to all the places we wanted to go and there was always taxis outside the hotel too. On one of the evenings we got back to our hotel around 7ish after being out all day walking and we was exhausted so instead of going out we ordered room service. The food was amazing and came very well presented, even if the person on the phone didn't understand us when we asked for some Coca Cola haha. On our final morning we had a late morning flight so decided to pay to have the breakfast in the hotel which cost around 20 euros each which is quite a lot but I thought the variety was fantastic. They had everything from cereals, pastries, fruit and meats/cheeses, as well as your fry up food. There was also a huge variety of flavoured teas and juices and as it was a buffet style you could go back as many times as you like and fill up for the day. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and don't let the distance from the main attractions put you off as it's easy enough to get to where you want to go. ",4,2016,07,14
30,Barcelona vaction,"We had a wonderful stay at Hesperia Tower . Great customer service, very clean room and our room view was fantastic 20 floor , the location not that great its far from the tourist points from the city its a long 30-40 min ride on the Metro Lin the good thing the stop to the metro in 3 min walk distance from the hotel.",4,2016,07,14
30,All in all a good place to stay," We didn't pay top dollar, so I can see how someone paying a lot might not be impressed but we had a great stay. Room was upgraded. Stunning view of city from 19th floor. Staff were helpful and courteous. The metro stops across the road and the shuttle bus service operates several times a day. Yes the fittings are a little scuffed and worn. If you are precious about that stuff look elsewhere. Everything worked and was clean and the showers were superb.",4,2016,07,14
30,3 star quality for 5 star price,"Stayed there for 1 night before going to an early flight.  Lots of problems.  I had a roll away bed instead of a real bed.  Restaurant that was advertised was not open anymore yet still advertised. Place was falling apart (old rugs, dated furniture, etc).  Gym is not actually a part of the hotel, but a separate facility you need to pay for.  Don't even offer complimentary water in the rooms.  Very high price with no perks.  Management and staff unhelpful and don't seem motivated.   I suggest other places are much better for the price.  ",1,2016,07,11
30,A home from home,"Quite surprised at the apartment we got, it was a little musty,dank when we arrived but we left windows open and it cleared up the smell of the room,some fixture need repairing and decoration of room is modern but visibly used.
We just used the apartment as a base, but for the last two nights we ate in Restuarant.Excellant food and service by",4,2016,07,09
30,Dont be fooled by the location,"This is an airport/business hotel.
Was perfect for us - for a night as our flight home leaves at 9am.
But don't book here thinking you will walk to pleasant Barcelona cafes. You are a 15-20 minute cab ride away - at best.
This is a business hotel. 
They are a little slow on a bellman coming to help with you luggage - but the rooms are clean and quiet and if you have a city view - excellent views. 
If they give you VIP status - not sure why we rated - you get free access to their 5th floor club. Free snacks, beer, wine, soda. 
Sadly this matched any highlight of our two week trip for my kids.
It is next door to an honest to goodness gym so you can work some of the paella off.
I'd only stay here if you have an early flight the next morning - then it is perfect...",3,2016,07,09
30,Great Location but shoddy roomsa,"We stayed in this hotel in April and as it was near the cruise terminal we booked it again for the 25th June.   This time we booked 6 weeks in advance and prepayed for the room.    When we arrived at 3pm, which is checking in time, there were no twin rooms available.   The only room they had was a suite and they wanted to charge us an extra ‚Ç¨45 for the privilege.  Upon viewing the suite we decided not to take it as it smelt horrible and the beds were together and could not be separated, which in my opinion is not a twin room.    We said we would wait for a twin room to become available.   After 4pm we went back to the desk to find out what the holdup was.   Luckily the room was now available.   They said they would get us when it was available but didn't.

To our surprise it was the same room that we stayed in, in April (Room 1507).   I was extremely disappointed though.   When we stayed before we told the hotel that parts of the room were shoddy and they said they would look into them.   Unfortunately they did nothing.   There were still burn marks on the carpet, the table had a huge chunk taken out of it and the sofa was ripped.   We asked for Tea and Coffee making facilities.   30 minutes later a woman appeared with a cup of coffee!   We said NO, a kettle and tea and coffee.   They eventually sorted it out.   

On a plus side the beds were comfortable.    I think that as they were much busier than the last time we stayed this affected the customer service.   

Unfortunately though we will not be staying here again.",2,2016,07,09
30,Quiet big rooms but far away from the city center,"I was in the Hesperia for a conference with around 200 participants. All the staff did an excellent job during our conference there was nothing to complain. 
The room itself was quiet big with a bedroom separeted from the bathroom. I had a very comfortable sleep because of different pillows and a great bed. 
Breakfast was excellent with a lot of different food.
The only little complain I do have is the elevator system. The system should coordinate the fasted elevator out of 4. However during breakfast time I had to wait allmost 10 minutes to get down. Unfortunately not stairs available to walk only the emergeny stairs.",4,2016,07,06
30,Beautiful hotel with such helpful staff,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for four nights a few months ago. It was 10 minutes from the airport and the staff were amazing! The concierge looked quite young but was so helpful giving us maps, metro details ect, as the hotel was ‚Ç¨20 for a taxi into the city. The metro card was ‚Ç¨10pp and was a 1 min walk from the hotel. Breakfast was amazing with everything you could think of there, including champagne ‚ò∫Ô∏è and the restaurant was outstanding,our room was large with amazing views of Barcelona as we were on the 16th floor and beautifully kept, I could not recommend this hotel enough would definitely go back again! Also we were out for one of the days till around 7pm and arrived back with chocolates ect and a note saying there was a water shortage? Which we didn't even notice! Lovely surprise!",5,2016,07,05
30,Dramatic tower not far from the airport,"I stayed here three nights during a conference that was held at the hotel.  Our room on the 19th floor was very comfortable with a dramatic view, and the spaceship-like dome on the top of the tower housed a good bar with 360 degree panoramas.  The hotel is fairly isolated, not great if you want to walk to anywhere else, but overall a comfortable and pleasant place to stay. An adjacent health club with a pool is available for an extra fee, but we didn't find it very inviting.",4,2016,07,04
30,Fantastic hotel,Hesperia tower is great hotel to stay in. the rooms have awesome bathrooms in them and everything is nice and tidy. But the real highlight of this hotel is their breakfast. They have tons of selection and the staff is always on point. I enjoyed my stay here. Very accommodating and welcoming.  ,5,2016,07,03
30,Great staff,"I really enjoyed the stay in this hotel. The staff is really friendly and helpful. It's approximately 200 meters from the nearest metro. The only downside is that it's the last metro stop so it's a 20-25 minute metro ride to the city's center. But using the metro is easy and affordable. 
Would definitely stay again. ",5,2016,07,02
30,Good value and convenient to airport ,"Very cool hotel with a lot of modern design.  

Only negatives are the shuttle timetable is not all day see photo in my review. However you can catch a public bus all day from 100m away only eur2.15. 

Also the gym is eur12 and reception staff quality is variable. For example I asked where the gym was and they pointed me in that direction. Only to find out when I got there (200m walk) that you need to pay for a token to enter!

Will stay again!",5,2016,06,30
30,A quick stay in Barcelona,GORGEOUS room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Barcelona city lights. This was the kind of room that impedes progress in sightseeing...because you want to just order room service and lounge around the room enjoying your own private scenery. A late dinner in the restaurant was equally delightful. The next day's convenient shuttle to the airport topped the experience.  Perfection.,5,2016,06,28
30,Hesperia tower 5 star,Great clean hotel with friendly staff free wifi great rooms and amazing breakfast. Great location (10 minutes from airport) . 20 minutes from city centre.You won't be tired for the beds are incredible. Over 206 tv channels. The bars are very innovative and unique. This is a fine hotel,5,2016,06,26
30,Great hotel between the airport and the city,"I stayed here as part of a business meeting.  The room I had on the 24th floor was great - floor to ceiling windows and the sea in the distance (looking over and past a lot of traffic!).  The staff here were mostly really helpful.  There was one occasion when I wanted to book a car and waited 20 minutes for someone to help me as the girl on reception either didn't understand me or didn't know how to book one.

Food was brilliant.  We were there during the Euros and they had football on in the bar which was great.

For meeting space you can't fault this hotel.  Communication with the hotel upfront was difficult but on site was an absolute pleasure.

As a tourist I'd probably stay further into the city although the cost of this hotel is probably worth the taxis and metros in to the city.",4,2016,06,26
30,Modern hotel awesome amenities ,"Extremely clean well maintained modern hotel with five star service will make you feel like a celebrity. Excellent shuttle from airport, next to metro line. Rooms are large and very modern and comfortable bathrooms are modern and futuristic with plenty of amenities mini bar provided. Great restaurants in house staff will go out of there way to meet your needs. ",5,2016,06,23
30,Nice Hotel & friendly staff,"Very nice hotel to stay in for such an affordable price. The hotel is not in the central area, however, the metro station cross the road make it an easy access to the centre.
Friendly staff. The only cons is the shuttle bus too small which can only accommodate about 11/12 person and always full.",5,2016,06,22
30,Well-appointed Rooms in an OK location,"I stayed at this hotel for three nights as part of a tour group. The room was large by European standards, with a comfortable bed, large bathroom, and wardrobe area. It was clean, well-lit, and functional. 

Their breakfast is excellent and far-exceeded my expectations. They even have gluten-free items! And, cava for morning mimosas! 

If you are visiting Barcelona, you will have to weigh the benefits of the nice large, a/c rooms and super breakfast over the convenience of being right in the old city.  The hotel does offer a shuttle into the main city, but we took the metro which is about a five minute walk from the hotel. It's about a 25 minute ride into the main piazza-easy to navigate, buy tix etc. 

Taxis are expensive if you are solo, not bad if split several ways.  It was about E25 from the airport to the hotel; and about E20 from old town back to the hotel. The taxis are clean, metered and drivers were friendly.  The hotel does offer airport shuttles but they are not on demand so you'll have to check and see if their schedule works for you.",4,2016,06,20
30,Very good experience,"I was at a conference and near the hospital where this was based, Otherwise the location isn't good and I was here during the metro strike so getting into town was not easy. You can't just wonder out and see the Catalan atmosphere. The hotel itself was excellent with nice rooms and the power show was amazing. Staff very professional.",4,2016,06,19
30,Meh,"I thought the hotel is in a good location for airport and metro. However it is not a five star standard hotel. The check in was arduous and lengthy, the waiter got both of our orders wrong and the food we did get was average. You have to PAY to use the gym and swimming pool - for paying guests I was disappointed with this. 

The hotel does look good to be fair and the rooms are nice but it's just not top quality. ",3,2016,06,15
30,Accomodation en suit nr. 1714,"Amazing Hotel, luxury interiors, very kind staff, I use to spend nights here in Hesperia, and every time is better. I'm here just for one night, and I suggest the hotel also for who wish to stay more to visit Barcelona because is close to Plaza de Espagna (10 minutes by taxi), 15 to Barceloneta, and the same to the Olympic district. I wish to thank Miquel fro the reception, because this time he assisted us at check in very very well.",5,2016,06,15
30,"Excellent hotel, bad location","The hotel was great, very comfortable, clean, helpful service.  Unfortunately, it is near nothing, no restaurants are nearby.  The metro is convenient but it is a 30 minute ride downtown to the city.  This is a great hotel for a business trip but because of the location, I would not recommend it for a vacation stay.",4,2016,06,15
30,De√ßu,"The conciergerie  of hotel  is not good. We asked the receptionist  to send our postcards, she promised us to do that, in addition the chef of reception  affirmed that our cards will be sent but nobody received them. We are very disappointed. For the 5 star hotel it is shameful.",3,2016,06,14
30,'Design' over practicality,"Nice, clean and comfortable hotel but some down points -  opposite the metro station at the end of the line but across a roundabout and lonely and quiet area at night, I wouldn't want to be alone. Door to hotel room opens straight into the 'bathroom area', with mirrors everywhere, so if you particularly value privacy stay elsewhere.",3,2016,06,12
30,Quick stay,"We were only there one night between our flight to Barcelona and our cruise, and were pleasantly surprised by the modern updated style. The staff was very friendly, check-in was a breeze, and the blackout curtains worked so well, that coupled with our melatonin, we overslept!! We got a friendly reminder call at 12:20 pm (aka waked up call) that our check-out was at noon (oops), and were so thankful that they did not charge us for staying over. We requested a king bed and got two beds pushed together (which I'm assuming is typical in this area- it happened again at another hotel). There wasn't any (free) breakfast. For one night,. it was great. Could have stayed more if needed. It's a bit of a ways from the city, but pretty close to the airport",4,2016,06,12
30,Nice hotel but not quite 5 star,"I'm going to be honest and say we got this hotel on a really good deal and can't complain as we did enjoy our stay.

Our room was clean and spacious with a lovely view, free wifi and big shower.

Staff were really nice and made a great effort allowing us to check in early and making good conversation in English, asking about our stay and if we needed help with maps etc. It seemed nothing would be too much of an ask.

They provide a shuttle bus to both airport and beach, although the times didn't suit us particularly well it's good to know.

I would say some bits are starting to look a little tired/just need a freshen up. I'd also say yes there is a mini bar, but it'd be nice to have free tea/coffee making facilities within the room. Little things like that would make me say it's more 4* in comparison to other 5* hotels I've stayed in.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you're wanting to be in the heart of Barcelona but you are a 30 minute metro ride away so if you can cope with that it is a lovely stay. And like I said we got a good deal, so for the going rate it would normally be quite expensive.",4,2016,06,11
30,Very nice but a few reservations,"The hotel lovely.  It's modern and clean.

The hotel reception staff are efficient and courteous, they speak English which is great.  Checking in is very quick.

The conference facilities are great.  The AV technician , Felix, was very helpful and friendly.

The bedroom was very nice.  The room was clean and very elegant.
I was disappointed that they don't have tea/coffee making facilities in the room, so they lose star for that. I found out on my second day that they have free coffee in reception for early check out between 5am - 7am.  It's still a pain to trek down stairs to get a coffee.

The shower room is a challenge despite the infographic on the wall.  On my first morning I was greeted with freezing cold spray straight at me by the wall sprays which someone must have left like that for a joke.  Housekeeping need to check things like that.

Food was pleasant, large selection at breakfast with great staff.  They have a section for Gluten free and special diet which is more than most places do.

The gluten free bread was very unpleasant and had a 'dusty' texture, so I was glad I brought my own.  

The conference food for delegates seemed nice but they didn't make much effort for the gluten free conference staff, the gluten free was mostly inedible and I was reduced to having a salad.  Somewhere along the line they must have cross contaminated the gluten free because after the first day I became quite ill with gluten problems.

Free wifi throughout and a good speed.",4,2016,06,10
30,Excellent!!,"Very nice looking hotel. The amenities were just perfect for a business hotel. The staff were friendly and always smiling. It was my first business trip to Barcelona and the staff made me feel very welcome. The only thing that needs improving is the quality of the WiFi. It kept going off, its important to have very good fast internet for business travellers because we are constantly working. ",5,2016,06,08
30,Excellent modern hotel almost out of the city centre,"This is an excellent modern high rise hotel on the outskirts of Barcelona. It is reasonably close to the airport and from certain rooms and floors one can see the planes taking off and landing. Some of the tall buildings, including the Museum can be seen from some of the rooms. The reception staff are quite knowledgeable and helpful. The only drawback is the distance from the tourist sights as you have to take the Metro, in the hospital grounds close-by or the infrequent hotel shuttle bus. Because of time it takes to get into and out of the city centre, one can only go into the city once and stay there. Surprisingly in Spain, where the people often eat very late at night, the at least one of the restaurants closes by 8:00 pm!",4,2016,06,06
30,Lovely hotel,Me and my husband stayed here for our anniversary last year the hotel was immaculate couldn't fault it! We stayed in a suite which meant we had a tower club card which was fab as u could go there and eat and drink anything you wanted well worth it. Fab location for the metro we used this everyday we stayed. Fab hotel great staff!,5,2016,06,05
30,Not a great hotel!,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during the half term break. Myself and a friend had a suite and the room was nice, clean and acceptable. After being given the option to upgrade to the duplex suite viewing the duplex suite we preferred this room. 

In general the hotel is very far from the city centre, roughly 20 euros for a trip to the city centre. There is no local beach and a small shuttle bus that does not come regularly is available to take hotel guests there however it does not seat many people and the journey back is still questionable.

The food in the hotel is basic and not very good. The options for room service were not great and overall for a 5 star hotel it was very underwhelming. Furthermore, the hotel staff were very rude and unhelpful throughout our stay and made us feel very uncomfortable at times.

Taxis tended to be a problem in the evening and despite pre ordering a taxi with reception for a certain time every night one 2/3 nights we were left waiting in the lobby for 45 mins for a taxi to the city centre as there is nothing to do within the hotel area. There were even times when the hotel staff said we probably would not be able to go out as they were not able to get taxis to pick us up from the location.

In relation to the spa, thankfully this was included in our room package. For you want to enter the pool you are required to buy a swimming cap, which you have to pay for. There is an ant problem by the pool and ants were crawling everywhere it was quite sickening and the hotel pool staff are definitely aware of this and you could
See this was just a causal thing. The 'jacuzzi' was far from great alongside the sauna and steam room. Overall it was not at all worth it. However, the gym seemed okay.

The hotel staff were not great and they were very rude and unhelpful at times. I would not recommend staying in this hotel and would not go back again. I would suggest paying a little extra and staying in the city centre where u can access everywhere u need to go to easily and there are many better hotels.

30,Nice hotel but not central,"Hesperia Tower is located in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat which is a residential suburb of Barcelona. The bus stop which takes you into central Barcelona is a 5 minute walk under a subway to get to it, it is about the same distance away to the tube station which is much faster and runs later (until about 11PM). A taxi into the center of Barcelona is about 20 minutes (about EUR 15.00). Inside the hotel is has a uxurious feel and has a grand well designed lobby however we did have to wait about 30 minutes to check in due to there not being many staff. The rooms were excellent and large and very nicely designed. The view from our window however overlooked a residential apartment complex. For anyone who wants 5* feel on a budget",4,2016,06,01
30,"Close to the airport, nice rooms, far from the city","Nice hotel not far from the airport but as a result far from the city. But not a problem because the taxis are not so expansive in Barcelona. 

My suite on the 24th floor, nicly furnished but had a strange smell, as if nobody stayed in the suite for a longer time. The suite had a nice living room and a spacious bedroom and a very spacious bathroom with huge bathtub.

The staff was very friendly and also the food from the roomservice was good.",4,2016,05,30
30,Skip this hotel.,Go someplace else. This is not a surprise visit. I booked my room two months ago.  I have been waiting in the lobby for 3 hours to get my room. They want me to wait another hour because they are busy.  There is nothing of interest in the surrounding area. The hotel is in the outskirts  so there is nothing to see.,1,2016,05,27
30,A 4 1/2 star hotel!,"We booked this hotel for our recent stay in Barcelona.  Firstly the location, the hotel is situated in the middle of a housing area with what could be politely described as 'affordable high rise flats accommodation' around it, however it seemed very safe whilst we were there.  It is also next to a large hospital but it doesn't really have much else around it, certainly no restaurants or bars within walking distance.  But on the plus side it is 5 minutes walk from the Metro station and you can get a train directly to the centre at a cost of 1 Euro, the journey take around 1/2 hour.  There is also a free bus too and from the airport every couple of hours.
The hotel itself is of a very high standard, feel it's more a luxury 4 star than 5.  However although not cheap, we felt the cost represented value for money.  We upgraded to a suite which gave us access to the executive lounge for 55 Euro extra a night.  This meant we could eat a basic breakfast and light lunches as well as drinks at no additional cost.  I would recommend this as we felt it paid for itself and the lounge is very pleasant to be.
There was only a couple of slight negatives to our stay.  Firstly we ate in the only restaurant Bouquet, which was far too expensive for the standard of food.  We paid 26EUR each for 4 scallops which was supposed to be a main course yet is smaller than most starters we've had.  We ended up hungry so had to top up on snacks in the lounge!
Also top floor tower dome is no longer open to guests, which seems a bit silly as this would give amazing views over the city and disappointed us somewhat.
However overall a very pleasant stay, and if you can live with being outside the city definitely a worth contender for a luxury stay.",4,2016,05,25
30,Lovely Hotel - Definitely 5*,"We stayed at this hotel in May 2015. Myself and my boyfriend had a beautiful room on the 14th floor with a spectacular view. A little further out from Barcelona city centre but closer to the airport. Ideal metro stop about 200 metres from the hotel where you can get on and get a direct line straight to Barcelona on the central line in 20/25 minutes. We spent most evenings in the hotel bar and had great cocktails. Francesco, the barman was lovely. The hotel restaurant had beautiful food and the waiting staff were fantastic. I had a great paella and also an amazing steak cooked to perforation. A Great place to stay when visiting Barcelona if you don't mind travelling a little while to get to the main city. The hotel offers a shuttle service at certain times of the day that takes you to Barcelona city centre and also to the airport although we never used this service to the airport as the times didn't coincide with when our flight was. We had breakfast here on the last day and there was a lot of choice that seemed to cater for everyone. Thank you to everyone at Hesperia Tower for a lovely stay.",5,2016,05,22
30,"Good hotel, close to the airport","A cut above your average business hotel - a stylish, modern building. Very nice, large, well appointed rooms. Good bed and an excellent shower. Slept soundly. Good view from higher up in the tower
Breakfast buffet was fine - pretty standard for this sort of hotel.
Just 10-15 mins from airport, convenient for flying, but not exactly a picturesque location - about 25 mins to city centre, where most restaurants and attractions are.",4,2016,05,22
30,Great hotel ,"Stayed for one week in the apartment side of the hotel. Hotel is a bit removed from the city centre, however it is right next to the subway ( Bellvitge, last stop on red line). The hotel also offers a shuttle from the airport and into the downtown which is great. It only makes a few runs in the morning and in the evening but it is reliable and FREE. The hotel is next a small trip of markets (a bakery, vegetable market, a deli, a couple bars and take away places and other small shops). The neighbourhood is a little rough around the edges, but my wife and I visited there daily for the essentials. 

The hotel has great staff and very clean. I would stay there again and I would personally recommend to people.

30,a bit disappointed ,"Hotel presents some good points and some negative ones.

Good: spacious rooms, nice view, convenient shuttle service, nice and clean bathroom, full breakfast with various choices.

Negative:
- the room we had booked was a superior room and we paid extra while booking to get a view on barcelona city. when we arrived we were given a basic room with view on the parking lot. the first lady in reception replied ""when you pay extra for a view, it can be a view on the city or the highway, we are fully booked on the others with view on the city"". 

- the hotel advertises a gym and a pool. beware: its not even in the same building, its a separate company that runs it and its very crowded (far from the idea of a relaxing spa time).
",3,2016,05,18
30,Comfortable and very convenient,"We had a very nice room upon the 15th floor. This was a one-night stay prior to flying out the next morning. Very much appreciated the shuttle to/from the Pla√ßa de Catalunya, at a sister property of the hotel. We had arrived by train that afternoon and were able to just go to the other hotel and get the shuttle to the Hesperia Tower. Our room was spacious and the extra mirrors made it seem even more so. I tend to judge hotels by the bathrooms and this one was quite nice, especially the shower. Very good check-in experience, too. We did not have an opportunity to the try the breakfast buffet but hope to do so if we return.",5,2016,05,06
30,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here before picking up a cruise from Barcelona Port.  The hotel is away from Barcelona proper but they provide transport to and from Placa de Catalunya which is at the top of Las Ramblas so you can catch all the atmosphere. The hotel also has a spa.

The hotel is clean and bright and our room was on the 15th floor with floor to ceiling windows, lovely views and electric curtains.

The bathroom was big with two sinks, separate toilet and large walk in shower.  The twin beds were large and very comfortable.  There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room but you can ask for this at Reception and they provide this for a small charge.

There is a bar and restaurant, breakfast and evening meals can be obtained.  We had room service and this was very good.

The staff are very courteous and helpful.  There are taxis outside the hotel for onward journeys.

All in all a very pleasant hotel and we will be using them again later this year.",4,2016,05,06
30,Reasonable and comfortable,"I stayed here just before catching a flight out of Barcelona.  The hotel was very comfortable -  I think I was upgraded to a suite unless all rooms are that nice!  I can't comment on the breakfasts or other amenities as I just slept and left very early.   However, for what I wanted it for it was perfect - about a 5-10 min taxi ride to the airport - taxis were outside waiting even at 5 am!",5,2016,05,04
30,Almost excellent!,"This place is soooo close to being so good that I probably wouldn't be able to afford it.  The decor is inventive and extremely comfortable, the cleanliness and overall condition of the hotel is great, and the food at the restaurant is very good - I'd eat there even if there were more other options nearby.  

There are just a couple of problems that keep it from the highest rating (and perhaps keep it slightly less costly than one might expect): 

We booked it as a place to stay near the airport because we had an early flight, and it advertises an airport shuttle.  The problem is that the shuttle has a fixed schedule and doesn't start running until 7:10am, which we only learned when we checked in.  They did book us a taxi, but the taxi service to Barcelona airport is a complete rip-off because they charge a flat rate that is much more than a metered fare would be from this hotel.  And in any case, to be a 5-star hotel you should offer 24 hour shuttle service.

The other issue is the overall service.  The check-in process was very slow, for no clear reason.  Then we went to the bar for a drink and ended up having to go to the bar itself to flag down a server.  And the service at the restaurant was not so much prompt as abrupt - we'd only been seated for a few minutes when a rather brusque fellow came over to take our order.  And then when it was time for the bill, that took too long.

All in all, though, with a few simple tweaks this can be a fantastic place so don't hesitate to book it.",4,2016,04,27
30,Beautiful Hotel,"Stunning hotel, rooms are lovely. Bed is a great size, loved the bathroom which has an amazing shower! Bonus now on reading previous reviews is that they have added tea & coffee making facilities in the rooms.
Staff all very courteous especially the barman who even organised a cup of tea for us at midnight. Had breakfast in room two days and it was spot on, breakfast in the restaurant offered a lot more choice with ever possible type of food imaginable. 
The hotel is situated at the end of the metro line so very easy not to get lost and it's only a few minutes walk from the hotel. Takes about 25mins to get to Catalunya sq and a very easy journey. 
We did miss out on an opportunity to go up to the rooftop bar as we weren't aware it was open. A few friends stayed out late and barman told them on return and they said it was amazing but only open certain times. 
Overall very pleased with hotel and would recommend it as a place to stay with friends or in a couple. ",5,2016,04,26
30,2 nights stay at Hotel Hesperia! ,"My boyfriend and I have just spent two lovely nights at this hotel. We went to Barcelona for his belated 21st birthday celebrations and were treated so well.

Pros: Great, spacious room with stunning views (see pictures), prompt and delicious room service delivered on a table trolley set for dining in a 5* restaurant...in the comfort of your own hotel room, robes and slippers provided...along with the lovely shampoo, shower gel, hair mask, shoe shine etc., well stocked mini bar, a button to open and close the curtains, three different shower options (jets, hand shower, ceiling shower), the hotel has a free shuttle bus that runs throughout the day, to either Placa Catalunya or the airport. Both trips are quick and it was always on time. Supermarket 2 minutes walk from the hotel. 

The hotel staff wrote 'happy 21st...' on the mirror for me which was really sweet. 
 
What most pleased us was champagne and chocolate strawberries being delivered to our room with compliments from the hotel. We were so pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed it all. 

Cons: you should allow 5 mins to wait for the lift (busy hotel - lifts always seem to be in use but system is good), the room card is a bit temperamental. 

I would recommend renting bikes near Arc de Triumph as there are good places to cycle around that area. 

We stayed on the 12th floor. 
Thank you Hesperia! ",5,2016,04,26
30,Airport hotel,"7 minutes from airport and 25 minutes from ramblas. Metro station at 2 minutes walking. Perfect the room,very nice and helpful people at reception desk. Cleaning staff enter the room even if the ""don t disturb"" sign is on the door",4,2016,04,26
30,"Business hotel, remote location","The hotel is situated outside Barcelona, in industrial area, close to the convention centers however, close is relative - it is like 8Euro taxi ride, 5-10 min or 30 min walk in no so amazing environment. 
The design of the hotel is real nice, too many mirrors (incl in the rooms that could confuse you) but above all, good presentation. 
Elevators could be a challenge but once you get used to the waiting and learn the name of the restaurant you wanna go for breakfast, it is OK. 
And now start the ""but""s. When I stay in a hotel like this, primary focus on business I anticipate that gym is available but apparently if depends on your rate and even though you pay quite well to stay , you still do not have access. 
Service is OK but slow and don't expect the extra mile. Internet available for free however we all had issues with connectivity. 
Then, it is nicely furnished, but some things are missing; Bathroom was shower only and there were like mold spots on the ceiling. 
Breakfast buffet real good , staff nice however too fast to get your plate and silverware. 
Taxis are usually present in front and hotel offers free shuttle to city and airport.",3,2016,04,26
30,Great Hotel,"Although we had booked through hotwire, we still got a decent room with a decent view. The hotel is clean and the staff very helpfull. The location of the hotel is a bit far from the main attractions in Barcelona. 20 minutes by subway to Las Ramblas",5,2016,04,25
30,Lovely,"I throughly enjoyed my 3 night stay at Hesperia Tower in Barcelona. Highly professional and friendly staff, superb restaurants and top view especially from the top floor! Modern, spacious with all the amenities that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Cost of staying was reasonable and even more economical than many inferior 4 star hotels. Might not be in the center but it does have a nearby bus station and it is roughly 200 meters from the Hospital de Bellvitge metro station. Plus, it has a complimentary shuttle bus to El Prat. Will definitely stay again.",5,2016,04,25
30,Lovely Hotel -- Wish We Could Have Enjoyed it Longer,"We chose to stay at Hesperian Tower, as we had an early flight in the morning.  Unfortunately, our flight in from Seville was delayed 5 hours, so we basically checked in, went to dinner, went to bed and left at 4:00 am.  Our suite was wonderful -- huge!  I've never stayed in a hotel room with such a giant walk-in closet!  The reception staff was very nice and welcoming.  Hotel was very modern.  Wish we could have walked down the cool outside stairs....",5,2016,04,23
30,Good stay,"very nice hotel, perfectly suited for business trips around the congress center, not ideal for city holidays. great breakfast, but staff could be a little bit more attentive. however, I enjoyed my stay there very much.",5,2016,04,21
30,Fantastic stay,"We visited this hotel on El Classico weekend and we were not disappointed. Beautiful hotel, rooms were fabulous with fantastic views across to the airport and lovely helpful accommodating staff. Metro two minutes from the hotel but as there were four in our party a taxi at around ‚Ç¨15 to ‚Ç¨20 and a 10 -15 min drive to Las Ramblas was well worth it. I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to visit again soon.",5,2016,04,19
30,2 Days Business Conference,"I was attending and enjoying a 2 days conference at Hesperia Tower. The Hotel atmosphere and standards was very professional and at high standards.
Access from the airport is easy. Highly recommendable for conferences",4,2016,04,15
30,Cool design,"All the staff were excellent and very welcoming.  Free Wifi was great.  It is a little bit out of town but there is a metro station just outside.  It is also near the airport.  There is a free shuttle service to the beach and the airport.  The design of the whole building is quite excellent and energising.  I liked the room and bathroom design. The  Bouquet Restaurant on one of the lower floors was very good.  The food and service was excellent.  There were some disappoints though. Beware the ads with pictures of the amazing ""rooftop restaurant"".  That space with incredible views is not open as a restaurant anymore - only for special events.  I think this is the only hotel I have ever been in where there is no tea and coffee in the room.  You can order it for 12euros a day, not welcome news for caffeine addicts. There was no iron in the room and I always dislike having to ask for one to be brought to the room.  Overall good but the niggles didn't make it feel quite like the five star it claims to be.",4,2016,04,12
30,Weekend in Barcelona,"Romantic weekend in Barcelona. The hotel was perfect, not too far from the airport. Staff were brilliant, we upgraded to junior suite which was very nice and value for money. Metro station was a 2 min walk from hotel. Would definitely stay here again next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2016,04,12
30,nice hotel - missing a few key things,"Hotel ws lovely couldnt fault the room - location was about 10-15 mins outside city centre but a free shuttle ran every couple of hours or a taxi was only about ‚Ç¨15-18 one way into the centre of town, 

Room was missing key things like kettle and tea/coffee in room which was a shame - the breakfast on site was pricey but a little cafe down the road was much cheaper and better value. 

Couldn't fault the staff very helpful, informative and spoke very good English.",4,2016,04,12
30,"NOT 5 stars, but not bad... IF YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS","So first things first... It is an amazing structure. We arrived early and they where able to check us in early great!! Get up to the room on the 12th floor all touch screens in the lobby, super cool. 
Room was nice, not a bad view but not the best, however since the tower isn't exactly downtown I didn't think it was bad. automatic curtains... new too me, kinda cool!
The room had a few items I LOVE and a few things I wish it would have, first good....
GOOD: Robes, good bed, minibar (don't know how much) and the best of all THE SHOWER WAS WORTH THE ROOM RATE!! this thing was awesome 3 settings and no-matter how drunk or tired I felt this thing cured me. loved it!
BAR downstairs was awesome FRIENDLY STAFF at the bar almost all day and night, I would have rated this lower if it wasn't for the staff... super awesome and deff 5 star treatment from the staff. Example... wife left her jacket in the cab the night before, they rang up the company talked with them and got a ref. number all I had to do was provides some details. it was great. (never did get jacket back) but the staff at the desk and bar was super friendly. internet was free and very reliable which was a plus.
Bar area had AMEZING DRINKS a touch pricey but of course at a higher end resort. 
we checked out pool and bars and restaurants in the place, all very nice!
DOWN SIDE: restaurants where staggered (breakfast , lunch and dinner) and they weren't open at all times. very swanky but not friendly for people with kids (which we had w us) 
The Spa... was a combo of a workout area, lounge and pool.... NONE of which could have kids at... so we brought our swimming gear for nothing. there is absolutely nothing for kids to do in this place. it is NOT KID friendly. 
Secondly this is NOT a 5 star hotel anymore... little thing I read about I could see, scratches dents, nicks, cuts tears in the room... all would go un-noticed at 3-4 star but if you claim 5 star status..... these will not do.... I noticed them and I am not a 5 star guy.
The hotel has a shuttle to A/P and downtown but only run 8-10 times a day and may not suit everyone's timing, we never used it once due to timing. there are cabs just outside ALWAYS and we got a 3 day pass for the sub-way and it was right across the street at the hospital about 3 minute walk (red line). very convenient.
All in all a good time I would have rated it 3 but the staff/bar and shower bumped it up by 1 for me and it wasn't a bad time. just skip it if anyone is under 16.",4,2016,04,11
30,Very good hotel,"This hotel is a little further away from the centre of Barcelona but there is a metro link to take you into the centre. However the hotel does provide you with a shuttle to drop you to the centre free of charge! There is also a shuttle service to the airport too! You can also get to the hotel by metro from the airport so you do not need to get a taxi from the airport!

The rooms are very nice, very modern! The shower and wardrobe are in a separate room to the bedroom. The tv is a big one but the channels list does not match the tv settings! The room has been designed well, with the desk that has a hidden mirror that can be opened to do the make up! Shower worked very well and was very nice!

The hairdryer can be found plugged in front of the large mirror near the wardrobe, bathrooms are found in the wardrobes! Spare pillows found in the wardrobe and even hotel slippers!

House keeping are wonderful, they brought up an iron and the ironing board very quickly, and the extra slippers and towels! 

Ice can be filled up at the bar in the lobby, there is no ice machine!

Hotel staff are very friendly and willing to help you however they can, including helping to you to book tickets for shows etc. There is a spa but I didn't use it so cannot comment on it!

Breakfast if not already booked is very pricey! ‚Ç¨23 roughly is the price, if you have not already booked the breakfast I recommend take the first shuttle into Barcelona at 10am and have breakfast in the centre there are plenty of places near the drop off point of the shuttle!

Would definitely use this hotel again!",5,2016,04,08
30,Expensive!,"I recently came back from 5 nights in Barcelona. The hotel is clean and the rooms are nice especially the showers! However if you want to use the spa it's ‚Ç¨12 per person EACH time you wish to use the spa. They are very strict that you must wear a swimming cap and flip flops should you want to go in the main pool ( we didn't go in because of this) but you don't have to in the jacuzzi and steam/ sauna rooms! 

On arrival we had lunch before heading out into the city! I believe it was about ‚Ç¨25 each for a hamburger and chips! It was lovely but seemed expensive. If you want to get room service ‚Ç¨5 is added onto the price as well.

I think we were unlucky that our room was right at the end of the corridor by the fire exit! It didn't seem to matter what time of day/ night it was there was always noise like bottles being thrown away??

The staff were helpful, the lifts are quick and it's about 20 mins into the centre on the metro which is very reliable and only 5 min walk from the hotel. The restaurant/ bar on top of the hotel is closed which was disappointing.",3,2016,04,04
30,brilliant view of barcelona,"We arrived on Thursday and our room had been upgraded to one with a view of Barcelona at no extra cost. Rooms were cleaned twice a day. Bed was huge! Hotel transport was excellent, free bus into city and to airport. Highly recommend. We didn't have breakfast as at 24 euros each thought that was a bit steep. Metro 5 mins away or 10 euros in a taxi. Lovely and quiet and found a lovely local restaurant 5 mins walk away. La Flama had food to die for at very reasonable prices. Would definitely stay here again. Wifi also very good. Robes and slippers provided. Thankyou x",5,2016,04,04
30,Bummer,"First at the AirPort waiting for the  shuttle , waiting waiting and after three times of calling they advices me too take a cab, because the driver couldn't find me, I know this place so don't tell me I wasn't there. After a few calls the paid my cab so this was already a bummer but they fixed this, problem solved. The room looked nice but not even one window wasn't to open so only Airco and fake air, I really hate this and it doesn't feel comfortable! We woke up early in the morning because the curtains couldn't close :((( so I told the manager we are on holidays and like to sleep a bit more, 

After showing the problem with a photo the only thing he said , I'll tell the maintenance guys,,, :-00 so after paying ‚Ç¨190 for one night this is your answer , 

It was the first experience with this club and direct the last one , well done management , I'm working also in the tourist business but if I act like this it's better to stop ,  ",2,2016,04,02
30,Long weekend break,Excellent value service quality and very helpful staff for none Spanish speaking travelling good location for public services eg metro is 20 mins from the centre for all further on travel and sights..,5,2016,03,30
30,3 day break for girlfriends birthday,"Very nice clean hotel, close to the airport, stunning views, excellent staff, room on the 25th floor had Jacuzzi overlooking the Barcelona skyline........

We did have to taxi all over the place as the hotel is quite far out from the city centre......it was 20euros to the beach, city centre and Camp Nou. The airport was also about 15euros as well.

We would stay here again in the future.",4,2016,03,28
30,Luxurious business hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights during a business trip. For this purpose I believe it to be perfect. The location of the hotel is quite close to the airport (though no noise from planes) but a bit too far out to go to the Barcelona sights by foot. My room (22nd floor) was very big and comfortable, breakfast was extensive with friendly staff and hi-speed wifi was available everywhere. The bar at the top level offered nice views of Barcelona.",5,2016,03,27
30,Couldn't ask for more,"We had planned a weekend in Barcelona but unfortunately our flights were cancelled due to air traffic struck in France. That said well done Easy jet!! They put us up in a five star hotel all meals paid for .,. Brill hotel beautiful rooms and the staff from the room cleaners to the waiting on staff have all be so very very nice. Nothing to much trouble for them. Rooms spotlessly cleaned every day good food well done Hesperia and a massive thank you from all us stranded passengers xx",5,2016,03,25
30,Mostly Good,"On our return to the Hesperia Tower hotel, we were greeted with a warm welcome. The room was much the same as I has remembered from our visit 3 years ago. Clean, spacious and great views (17th floor). Breakfast was as good as before. Great selection of a wide variety of foods. The Breakfast Team were friendly and professional and didn't rush guests to vacate the tables, even though busy. Javier looked after us very well and made time to make us feel welcome. We were looking forwards to utilising the Spa facilities again but they now have stipulations in place, that guests 'must' use swimming cap and flip flops for the jacuzzi, sauna, swimming pool areas. A somewhat less attractive ruling, which put us off completely and we did not use the Spa at all as a result. good location for airport access an Metro close by made it easy to get into the city centre.",4,2016,03,24
30,The best,"Is my second time at this hotel and I will be back in May for my birthday. This hotel is amazing, the food it's so good, the rooms are so luxurious but I do think that the carpet starts to get dirty and old so will be nice if they change it.i love the free wifi,  free shuttle to and from the airport and to city centre . What I don't like it's that I had to pay to use the swimming pool and the spa , maybe that's how it works in Spain , because here in uk you don't pay for spa if you staying in the hotel. Except that , this hotel is the best where you can stay in Barcelona. By the way who makes this hotel so amazing are all the people who works there, the staff are so genuine polite and very helpful. Thanks Sara and Javier from the reception desk and all the staff from the restaurants , the shuttle driver .thanks everyone",5,2016,03,24
30,Perfect Hotel!,"This hotel is one of the best we've ever been to! The staff are amazing! When we arrived after our flight to Barcelona at 10pm, our room reservation couldn't be found, but a lovely gentleman at the desk called Roger helped us and sorted the problem with ease and made us feel welcomed all the same.

The staff are all so helpful and friendly, we felt as if we were being waited on 24/7. The room was spotless and was very fancy, with electric curtains and an amazing shower.

The hotel also has an amazing restaurant with incredibly polite staff and amazing food, we both had a fillet steak and they were both cooked perfectly how we like it. You can also order breakfast to your room, which is gorgeous. We also requested extra things on the breakfast, like beans, and this wasn't an issue at all. As well, they have a dome at the top of the 25-floor building that has a bar inside.

All of the staff were more than happy to help with anything and everything, and spoke very good English. As first timers in Spain, we were able to communicate well with the staff which was a massive help when we had the problems with checking in.",5,2016,03,22
30,"Great Hotel, Great city","Just got back after 5 nights at the Hesperia Tower Hotel (March 2016.) I travelled with 5 other friends to participate in the Barcelona Marathon and then a short break in the city, so we opted for a 5* Hotel - and it was a great choice.

The staff were very helpful and friendly throughout - provided good restaurant recommendations, helped with the metro and also places to see and clubs to visit. The location is probably the one downside as it is not walking distance to the city and there's only 1 supermarket and cafe close by.

Also as expected, the food and other add ons at the hotel are quite expensive. we never ate at the restaurant but the prices were quite high and the pool/gym, was 12‚Ç¨ a day - swimming cap and flip flops required. Bottles of water are 5‚Ç¨ +but aside from that it is very reasonable for a 5* hotel.

The rooms were spacious and provided great views (13th floor). No kettle/coffee machine in the rooms however & the air con didn't seem to have any effect but all other aspects met expectations for a comfortable stay.

The hotel is definitely suited for Business trips and conferences however I'd still recommend for a leisure trip and would return to this hotel. They run free shuttle buses to the airport and to the city several times a day. Alternatively the metro is less than 5 minutes walk and very cheap and taxis are less than 20‚Ç¨

All in all, a great hotel, with great service and reasonable prices.",4,2016,03,17
30,really really nice,"just got back after a one week stay (march) the hotel is very grand, we stayed on the 22nd floor, the views were amazing, we had access to the tower bar which serves snacks and drinks free of charge, its very relaxing! the bathroom was very plush and modern and the shower had 6 jets which are great for a massage.  dressing gowns and slippers provided.  telephone in the toilet made me chuckle.  

I used room service for a snack, the food, although expensive, was well presented and was delicious.  It was my birthday and even though i never mentioned it on arrival they gave me a little birthday cake in my room, a very nice touch.

Not great tele channels watched russia today for 7 days haha

It is a convention centre also, so it can get very busy, high speed lifts are cool. i never used the gym and spa facilities, you need flip flops and a swimming cap to use pool area.

i would definately return, i rate it high, oh did i mention the electric curtains, hahaha, i really need those.  the metro is just across the road and its super easy to navigate your way around.  taxi from airport are a fixed price of ¬£29 euros, ideally dont use them as it only clocked ¬£12 on the meter.",5,2016,03,15
30,"Room was nice and clean. However, reception staff were rude","Room was nice and clean. However, reception staff were rude. I had expected politeness from staff of 5 star hotel.
Room didn't even had a coffee machine. So if you need coffee or hot water to drink in cold weather, then you have to pay 5 euro for hot water and more each time to get it from room service.",3,2016,03,09
30,Wonderful Business Breakfast,"Yesterday, it was Saturday, I had breakfast with a customer at this hotel. I can¬¥t judge the rooms since I didn't spend the night but everything looks like very well accomodated. I would like to highlight the wonderful breakfast we had. We were attended by ""Javi"", you should ask for him if you have the chance to step by, everything indeed deserves the stars it has. I wanted to right because its difficult to find a goods business place downtown Barcelona. I don't know the cost because I was invited by my customer, but  I'll repeat for sure. Very much recommendable,",5,2016,03,06
30,Great hotel and apartments,We stayed 3 nights in a really good apartment at Hesperia Tower situated next to the hotel - plenty of space and all the facilities you would look for in an apartment. The staff at the hotel were really friendly and helpful. The hotel is conveniently situated for the airport and there is a shuttle bus to and from the city at certain times of the day. The metro is conveniently situate about 2 minutes walk from the hotel. There are shops to the rear of the apartments including a very nice bakery/coffee shop and a couple of mini supermarkets.,5,2016,03,06
30,Nice hotel but.....,"This hotel looks different to many others, I just get the feeling they are not making the most of it.
Good points - the rooms, very modern nice facilities, just don't expect a selection of English programmes on the tv! The hotel is spacious and the staff are mostly friendly and welcoming.
Bad points - no bar food after 7pm - restaurant is always full (supposedly) - and the cost of the food and drink.
Good business hotel, would I stay here as a private guest - no.",3,2016,03,05
30,Great hotel,I stayed one night at the Hesperia Tower hotel during a business conference. I really enjoyed the hotel and the food. The room was very comfortable and very quite which is good as Barcelona night life could be challenging. The hotel is very close from the airport and therefore you need to take a cab to go the city center. But it is not big of a deal. I loved the architecture of the hotel and again the room was very comfortable.,4,2016,03,04
30,Best hotel I've stayed in!,"I stayed in this hotel for a 3 days & I can't fault it. Our suite was amazing, the staff were really friendly & helpful. The only down side was that we wanted to go up to the dome for dinner but it was closed. & the location is not the best but the metro is like 3 mins away so it was ok. Views were stunning. If I return to Barcelona that will be my go to hotel. Well worth the money. 5* definitely.",5,2016,03,04
30,"Long weekend away, 3 nights","We were a bit apprehensive that the hotel was outside of the city centre, but once we got there, it didn't matter.OK, there are no attractions around the hotel, but there are several ways to get to the centre of Barcelona. There is a tube station 300 mtrs from the hotel that costs 2.15 euros to get to Catalunya square and run as often as the London Tube. Takes about 15 minutes. There is also a taxi rank outside the Hotel that will cost you 13-15 euros and , traffic permitting,  takes 10 minutes. The 3rd option is the minibus supplied by the hotel that drops you off at one of their partner hotels on the Rambla that runs at least 5 times a day, and is completely free.
As for the Hotel and its staff, we couldn't fault anything at all! The staff can't do enough for you. Nothing is too much trouble! The rooms are spacious and want for nothing. The views from anyside are fantastic, we were on the 21st floor so can't say anything about floors below.The lifts are a technical piece of engineering and travel up the outside of the building. All in all, a brilliant weekend. Please remember this is a 5 star hotel, so the bar and restaurant prices are reflected, but if you want to stay in a 5 star hotel, then expect 5 star prices.",5,2016,03,01
30,Birthday in Barcelona,"I stayed here on my birthday weekend, By far this is one of the most beautiful modern hotels I've ever stayed in. The staff are so friendly. Our room was exquisite! Had a beautiful view! The chef even made me a loverly cake for my birthday ! I would recommend this hotel and definitely stay here again when I next visit Barcelona!",5,2016,02,29
30,Great hotel with fantastic views.,"Just returned from visiting Barcelona and this hotel was a great choice of place to stay. Room was brilliantly equipped, large bed and great bathroom. The view from the bedroom window was stunning (we were on the 19th floor). The hotel provided a free minibus service in to the centre which is ideal but the metro line also runs right outside the hotel as well so access in to Barca is great. Staff were friendly and very helpful. To include breakfast was ‚Ç¨25pp which I think is a bit too steep but other than that I didn't have any issues with our stay at all.",5,2016,02,23
30,Great 2 night stay,"Me and My wife came here for 2 nights over the valentine weekend. The hotel decor is great, the room was really nice and the view was fantastic. I was really impressed with this hotel.....the location was great too. The metro station is literally 2 minute walk and the airport is about 8 minutes away by car/bus/taxi. The staff were really friendly and spoke clearly, and made us feel very welcomed. 

The electronic curtains were a great little touch. 

We loved our stay, and i've already said that it will be my ""Go to hotel"" from now on in Barcelona.",5,2016,02,18
30,Great hotel,I stayed here after my Madrid trip. It's kinda far from the center of the city however when I checked in the kind front desk person suggested me to upgrade 50euros per day and gets me into the club lounge. I did. The suite bathroom was just as big as a normal NYC hotel rooms. And the rest is go figure. Had a lovely time here and the club lounge was a awesome money saver because they have beer/liquor and also food.,5,2016,02,18
30,Overnight before cruise,"Really nice, modern, sharp looking room.  Excellent front desk and staff.  Maybe a little too good for just a night of sleep, but, was quite pleased.  Did not use restaurant nor did we check out the area.  About 15 minutes from the airport and 20 minutes to port and 30 minutes to main section of Barcelona.
",4,2016,02,17
30,Lovely stay,"Beautiful rooms, with spacious bed, electric curtains, fantastic shower and plenty of storage space. Bathroom was very plush and the bedroom area was lovely and comfy. Staff very pleasant and helpful, the only downside would be that it takes 25 mins by metro to get into the city centre. Also - check ahead to find the times of the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel as it is not very clear on arrival at the airport. 

Breakfast is available for 25 euro which we thought was a bit too expensive. 

All in all though a lovely stay.",5,2016,02,17
30,"Nice hotel, but a few shortcomings.","Pros: nice room with a good view; good bed; good shower; good, quick lifts; friendly, very helpful staff; spacious reception area; close to the airport.

Cons: a bit too far away from all the attractions for us, it took us 30 minutes by tube to get anywhere we wanted to go to; no tea/coffee making facilities in the room; disappointing shuttle service to/from the airport, we had expected the bus to run every 40 minutes during the day, but there are gaps in the schedule and we waited over an hour at the airport before making our own way; the swimming pool is an extra charge, ok if you are going to stay there all day, but a bit much if you just want to take a quick dip before breakfast; top floor bar with a fantastic view not open, apparently this is only used for meetings!",3,2016,02,16
30,Spent our anniversary in separate beds,"I booked a double room here in August for mine and my girlfriends one year anniversary. We arrived into Barcelona late at around midnight and with no shuttle to be found and seemingly no working telephone number we got a bus. 

When we arrived at the hotel we were told unfortunately there were no double rooms left unless we upgraded for ""just 75 Euros a night"". As we had paid 62 Euros a night for the room 'just 75 Euros' felt like a sharp increase. I've never been conned by a hotel before but this definitely felt like it. My girlfriend and I spent our anniversary in separate beds. 

On leaving, we had to pay the city tax and received our change of about 15 Euros all in 50 cents and euro coins because the receptionist didn't want to go through the hassle of replenishing the till. In the end, after arguing, he did and it only took him another 20 minutes to do it! The once an hour shuttle to the city could only hold 8 people but luckily there's a metro not far away it just takes a while.

TL;DR- Terrible service, crappy location, according to some of the other reviews, trying to force you to upgrade is common practice and very disappointing for an NH which are generally great hotels. Good shower though.",1,2016,02,13
30,great business hotel,"Nice hotel for business travelers; the breakfast was excellent with a large variety of local specialties, fresh juices and fruits; dinner was also outstanding. What I really loved was the attention to detail, I had to leave the hotel at 5 am yesterday and they had a mini breakfast ready for me and other early travelers with fresh croissants, fruit salad etc. and very tasty coffee. The view from my room was absolutely breathtaking at night. The only downside was that pool & gym access is not  included in the room rate (EUR 12) and that you have to bring flip flops and a cap for swimming, also that children are not allowed in the pool area, hence, I don't think this would be the place to bring children to",5,2016,02,11
30,Excellent stay,"We stayed here for a weekend and it was amazing and excellent hospitality provided to us by the team at Hesperia Tower.
Our stay was nevertheless made better by the generosity and professionalism of Francesc.
Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a very smiling Roger at the Front Desk, who was absolutely brilliant during our stay. He was always so helpful and kind, and I should say that Roger is a real star in your team, and the highlight of our stay.

The room we were given was amazing and the view was spectacular. Could not ask for more, and started our short weekend in an exceptional fashion. Thank you ever so much.

Overall, the stay was perfect, breakfast was very good, service overall was exceptional., and we will definitely come back. We felt like we are at home and did not want to leave.",5,2016,02,09
30,Great Hotel,"Great hotel all round, the rooms and bathrooms are amazing and were a real treat.
The staff at the reception were very friendly and helpful.
The only one small downfall is that it is about 15 minutes from the city centre via tram, but this was not a problem as they run all night most evenings and are very safe with security and guard dogs always present.
The pick pockets are rife in Barcelona, like all city centre's but I think if you are aware of this I think you will be perfectly safe.
It was our first time to Barcelona and I loved it and would definitely go back and stay in this hotel, as it was nice at the end of a busy day to get away from the city and relax.",4,2016,02,01
30,Perfect hotel and excellent service,"I spent two nights at Hesperia Tower because my University booked their theatre room for their final exams and I don't live in Barcelona, so I decided to sleep at the very same hotel. 
The hotel is just 10 mins away from the airport, which comes very handy to avoid traffic and stress and fear of losing your flight. This is a high-quality hotel with an elegant design and services such as a gym, a spa, several spaces to relax having a drink... Which I couldn't use because I was studying. So I'm planning to go back with my husband anytime soon, so I can enjoy the whole experience. 
I felt really comfortable there, mainly due to the hotel staff, who were really kind and professional -I must highlight the nice work of Eniht, the lady who cleaned the rooms at my floor, and the man who was at the room service on Saturday night, both of them were really nice.
The room was simply perfect. I got a superior room than the one I had booked and far from the elevator, as I'd requested. I believe being so comfortable and feeling spoiled made a great deal for my exams, since I was relaxed and everything went better than expected. 
Cons? Maybe it's a little bit far from the city, but I've seen that this hotel takes care of its clients and they make sure you can reach the city centre. Plus, the area is a little bit isolated. But I've been in this hotel for three days and I had everything I needed inside. 
I will definitely go back.",5,2016,01,25
30,Nice hotel,"I stayed here for a work event, the rooms were very nice, and it's very well decorated, sufficient for business travel, however as a business traveller, i noticed a couple of things - toiletries - there were no shower caps n do not have the standard ""stuff"" in the bathroom. What was kinda disappointing is the reception - they don't speak much english n their accent is so strong that i could hardly make out what they are saying! In addition, for it being a 5 start hotel, the uniform the receptionist was wearing was torn n tattered on some areas which were very noticeable. I thought that image was important for hotels n to notice their uniforms being worn .. thats not really good. Saying that, the concierge was so friendly and helpful! The location of the hotel is a bit far the city, taxi fare into Las Ramblas is about ‚Ç¨15 (without much traffic). There is a metro across the street, about 5 mins walk away that takes u directly into Catalunya (right in the centre).
i would recommend this hotel for business but if you're a tourist wanting to be in the central then probably not a good idea. 
The buffet breakfast is ok .. .pretty much standard hotel fare.",4,2016,01,22
30,Calm and tranquil,A very decent hotel. I stayed there for a night on business trip and there is nothing that I can complain about. Staff was very helpful. Restaurant was great and everyone was making sure that I get the best out of my stay.,5,2016,01,14
30,Great hotel!,Second stay at this hotel and still as great as every.  Friendly and accommodating staff. Wonderful rooms with amazing views.  Slightly out of Barcelona however metro line within a few minutes walk and hotel also offers courtesy shuttle to centre of Barcelona and also airport.  Excellent value for such a quality hotel - look forward to returning again some time.,5,2016,01,06
30,Very good choices,"Friendly staff,very nice breakfast and the spa,very clean,the view from the rooms is amazing!!!!!the location is very good near from airport and central ramplas and catalounyas also the metro is only 5 minutes i hope visit again...
      ",5,2016,01,02
30,"Great Hotel  , near metros,  but Pay extra to use the  Gym -pool etc","I stayed there for 4 weeks on a business trip. The Hotel was great,  the food was good, the location was not the best but  the Metro station is just across the street .
The rooms were really good and spacious.   Only complaint was that  we were asked to pay around 10-20 Eur extra  per day  to use the  Gym-pool  etc area  , this seemed unfair to me and most of the Guests.",4,2015,12,31
30,Pleasant Stay in a Modern and Comfortable Hotel,"The hotel is situated very near to the Barcelona International Airport (BCN), but a bit far away from the city center of Barcelona. Don't worry! The hotel offers the shuttle bus services to/from hotel and airport; and hotel and city center according to the bus schedule.  Any beyond the bus scheduled, you may consider to take a taxi as taxis in Barcelona are relatively cheaper than other major cities in Europe. Otherwise, you may take the metro, Line 1, at Hospital de Bellvitge station, just 5 min walk from hotel.  Reasonable hotel price.  My room was clean, modern and comfortable.  Breakfast is good, served with champagne.  Helpful, friendly and efficient staff.",4,2015,12,26
30,"Nice, but very outside","Nice hotel with large and comfortable rooms. Not so likely that the Fitness-Center is not included and not reduced, and you get this information late, mostly after booking.
Fira and airport is close, placa catalunya is nearly 30 mins away.",4,2015,12,26
30,"Fantastic hotel, great city.  ","We stayed as a last minute cheap romantic getaway and the hotel was fantastic. It was easy to get into the heart of Barcelona and the hotel was good value for money.  We ate in the restaurant 2 nights out of 3 and couldn't fault the food or service.  The only fault I can find would be that it would have been nice to have access to the spa included, at 14 euros per person per day it seemed a bit pricey so we didn't use. 
However rooms were large and airy.  
Thank you ",5,2015,12,20
30,"It is good only for business trips, not for private. Located close to the airport.","Hotel is quite old and shoulld be refurbished. Will not recemmend for huge events, lifts and restaurants could not serve a massive number of people at the same time.  Gym access is not included, should pay extra 14Euro a day. Staff is not realy welcoming..",3,2015,12,16
30,Beautiful boutique hotel,"A lovely Romantic boutique hotel.  Stayed here for 3 nights with the wife whilst we explored Barcelona.  It has a very impressive foyer.  Our room was also impressive with large walk in bathroom and lovely bedroom.  The staff are well dressed and very helpful with a good command of English.  The hotel is also directly opposite the metro system, about 3 to 5 minutes walk.  It's conveniently located at Hospital de Bellvitage which is the final stop on the L1 metro line (the red one).  It takes about 25 - 30 minutes to Catalunya, the centre of Barcelona and is a good place to start exploring.  If you get the chance do use the gym.  At 14 euros each it's wonderful way to relax in the spa & sauna after a day wondering in the city.  The only negatives for me were the restaurant at the top of the hotel was closed and the other restaurant was overly priced at about 25 euros per person. I would certainly stay here again as it was beautiful, stylish, modern, and perfect for a romantic weekend break.  Oh, and be patient with the lift system, it does take a few minutes to work out how to use the touch screen panel to operate the lifts.",4,2015,12,15
30,Very Good but ....,"Stayed for 5 nights on a B&B basis.

The hotel is close to the airport but be warned, taxis are obliged to charge you a tax for being at BCN. I took the Route 46 bus (25 mins) which dropped me off on the other side of the road to the hotel directly from outside Terminal 1 (it goes via Terminal 2 as well).
It is a business hotel with a convention centre/auditorium etc but of course accepts tourists like me. Because it is close to the airport, it is a tube (metro/subway) ride to the City Centre, however the tube stop is 4 mins walk away and takes you directly Downtown. The direct tube journey is about 1/2 hour to Catalunya Square, in the heart of the City's tourist centre. Further the tube is EASY to understand and go throughout the city for all the sights. Get a T-10 ticket for bargain tube/bus/other costs (10 journeys or if with somebody, 5 x 2 journeys as they can be transferred to others)
Our room was fantastic (23rd floor) although it only had a shower (with water jets !) not a bath. Spacious, clean and in my view very modern with electric curtains etc.
Breakfast was extensive with everything for the variety of guests that they receive (including Chinese Fried Rice and Chinese Soup for the large Far Eastern guests). So, whether it be a croissant et la confiture or a Full English, it is all there.
Staff was exceedingly helpful, all were wonderful.
Courtesy bus to from the hotel but limited hours of operation (hence the 46 bus to the hotel).
Free wifi.
So why not excellent ? Other writers have already stated the only annoying factor - the gym/swimming pool is not part of the hotel but a sports centre next door and you have to pay 14Euros per day to use it. Yet, the hotel advertises these facilities there. I feel a bit conned, this hotel should provide these services to guests free of charge. Not impressed by this aspect.
So, would I go back, yes and would I recommend it, yes but unless you are willing to pay the surcharge, leave your tracksuit at home.",4,2015,12,06
30,Great Business hotel,"The Hotel is located between Airport and the city. The rooms are big and clean, the staff is very friendly. Great breakfast with a large selection. 
I can recommend the Hotel for private and business trips!",5,2015,12,03
30,Excellent hotel with amazing views of Barcelona,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 night for a conference. This is one of the best hotel that I have stayed in while away on business. Check in experience was great, staff very friendly efficient. I was given a room on the 23rd floor and as soon as I entered the room I was amazed by the views from the huge window in my room. The room itself has a  beautiful d√©cor, well organized and immaculate. All the amenities that you would except in a 5 star hotel room were present. One night I had dinner at the hotel restaurant and my I had a great experience the waiters were professional and food delicious. I also ordered room service one night and the food was delivered within 15 minutes ad room service was good. Overall I had a very good experience staying at this hotel.",5,2015,12,03
30,"Excellent property, friendly staff, nice food","Excellent hotel n Barcelona situated in nice area and about 15 mins from airport.  Clean and elegant rooms, nice and pleasant embience of lobby, very friendly staff, delicious Spanish food. Only negative point is location as it is far from city center but you can reach city centres by metro from nearby metro station ",5,2015,12,02
30,Work and vacation trip ,We stayed at this hotel for 3 days of conference and then extended for a further 3 days for site seeing. The breakfast is really good in the hotel. Rooms are nice with a nice view but I feel the interior is a bit dark and tired also there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. Another big downer for us was that there is a gym in the building but you need to pay ‚Ç¨14 to use this which I feel is unacceptable for a 5 star. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is quite far from the main CBD,4,2015,11,30
30,Fantastic hotel!,"Hotel is located close to the airport (taxi ‚Ç¨ 25). My room was on 14th floor, and was as big as most hotel suites, with a great view of the City, especially in the night. All the staff was very nice and polite, some not speaking good English, but communication was possible. Reception staff very polite, well informed and helpful, no troubles there. Our conference catering was of high quality, including local fish and great desserts. The architecture might look a little strange, but I would rather call it special.",5,2015,11,29
30,Ordinary,"I am not sure how this hotel has got 5 stars. In Dubai, from where I had come from, I had stayed in much cosy and nicer 3 star hotels. The furniture in the room and the reception area has a lot of wear/tear and looks old. It looks like a worn out property. The rooms are tiny. The bathroom and toilet are two small cubicles. Taking a shower in the bathroom leads to water seepage through the door inside the room. All this is OK. You get the real shock when you can hear people around your room. The walls are real porous and you can hear a door open in the next room, people talking or what channel the next room guys are watching on TV. 

Why on earth should a person staying in the hotel have to pay to use the swimming pool?

The staff was good and courteous. The hotel is close to the metro and the airport.",2,2015,11,24
30,very good hotel,"room is clean and bed very confortable.   brekafast is also very various and taste good.  staff is freindly and very helpfil.   Its location also near metro with walking disctance.   inside room is very qutie. 
would liek to stay again next time,

30,Great stay,"Rooms are very modern, the views are spectacular and very quiet, not much around the hotel but transport links are very easy, free airport shuttle, left us a nice cake for our trip, staff are very helpful and polite - always ask for high floor rooms
",5,2015,11,21
30,Hotel Hesperia Tower,"Excellent 5 star hotel with friendly 5 star service. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The food in the main restaurant was reasonably priced and extremely well cooked and presented to a 5 star standard.
The room (on the 22nd floor) was very comfortable, clean with a luxurious bathroom and we had a terrific view. This is the second time we had been this year and will definitely be staying there again next year.",5,2015,11,17
30,Absolutely Incredible. Love this hotel!,"We came to this hotel for a 4 day short break in Barcelona. We had originally paid for a superior double room (I believe that's the name!) but upon arrival we were offered to upgrade to the Deluxe Suite for a reduced price. We obviously agreed and it was AWESOME! haha. 

The room was clean, air conditioned and had a fantastic view of the city. When the weather was clear we could see for miles! Housekeeping did a great job tidying and changing the towels etc in our room everyday. The staff are lovely and very helpful, we ordered room service twice and was always nice and hot and they gave us some extras with no cost :) 

Around the back of the hotel is a plaza that has a few shops and a pretty good small super market where you can pick up food, drink, hygiene stuff etc. The hotel is REALLY close to the first stop on the L1 line that goes through the heart of Barcelona and is the main line you need to get anywhere ;)

Seriously we loved it here and will 100% be coming back here. I'll upload photos soon so you guys can see the room and view we had :)

30,Good Stay for business trip,"This hotel offers everything you need when traveling for business to Barcelona Spain. Located strategically between El Prat airport and the business center of the city. Rooms are spacious, clean and good isolated against external noises. The beds and especially the carpet do look outdated and old. The prices are not too high for a 5 star hotel, however their breakfast is overpriced. The shuttle service is excellent!!",4,2015,11,15
30,Good hotel,This is a good hotel with very good rooms. The beds are excellent as well as the elaborate breakfast buffet. The hotel has an excellent fitness and swimming pool next door. It is located not far from the airport and zone franca but also not far from the city and it is close to a metro and there are always taxis in front of the hotel.,4,2015,11,10
30,All around a good business hotel,"Stayed for three nights as a part of business conference and was a comfortable stay. Clean, spacious rooms (though a bit dark for my taste) and a bit different bathroom with lots of mirrors and glass. The staff was very helpful (I wanted to enquire about the availability of a laptop that was recently launched in US and lady at the reception surfed many spanish shopping sites for the same) and could speak English well. Enjoyed it!",4,2015,11,10
30,"Average, but expensive",Some of the staff where nice and helpful. Rooms were lovely and clean. Although the hotel has a complimentary airport shuttle bus. Please ensure you book inadvance via telephone as email communication is not their strongest point beforehand to find the information of timings. The hotel only exchanges dollars into Euro and not GPB and to dine in there restaurant you have to wear dressy clothes.,3,2015,11,05
30,Modern & Luxurious!,"We have been in Barcelona several times, and this was our first time staying far from Las Ramblas or Plaza Catalu√±a. 

We picked this hotel because we knew we were going to stay just one night and then take a flight!....

Everything there was good. We had an inconvinient with the reception because they told us the restaurants where near (walking distance) and they were not. But it can happens and even when we were very upset, they offered us something extra because of this inconvinient and we took it. 

I would recommend it highly to business travellers and for conferences or just if you just are one night in Barcelona. It is a very good hotel, unfortunately the location is not so good for those who want to enjoy the city, night life or culture of Barcelona. I am not complaining of the location, as we have been in Barcelona many times, we knew it from the beginning.

The food in the hotel is top notch!

If we comebak to Barcelona just for one night, with no doubt I would stay here again.",5,2015,10,30
30,Wow!,"The bathroom - wow!
The view - wow!
The design - wow!
The Hesperia Tower is quickly becoming a Barcelona landmark as you come in on the train. Its futuristic spaceship presence sticks out in an otherwise low-build area. Not having bothered to research the hotel before arriving, we were all blown away on arrival. The lobby is huge and airy, with comfortable sofas and bean bags to wait around. From the elevators and your room, you can enjoy panoramic views of Barcelona, especially at sunrise. It's the sort of hotel that makes you really happy to just stay in, and invite your friends over to enjoy it, too.
It's in a quiet residential area, not too close to any sights or activities. However, you can go for a run in the adjacent park... Or just stay in and enjoy this architectural masterpiece of a hotel.
Good breakfast with real food, too.
Only downside: sometimes you have to wait ages for the lifts.",5,2015,10,26
30,Just  ''Woooow'' !!!,"This hotel is one that i will never forget . It's fabulous from the moment you walk in . it's big and modern with competent staff that are there for you . When i enter in the brakfast restaurant i just stop and stare , whas amazing , all that goods are for you :) .",5,2015,10,25
30,Large very corporate feel hotel,"Great hotel for corporate events and conferences, as a tourist though I can't recommend it as it is not in the ideal location and the hotel itself has a very corporate and hectic feel, instead of a warm and welcoming feeling that you would expect from a hotel. Very disappointing check in, as it was too slow and not friendly at all. The staff in general were very abrupt and not very helpful.",3,2015,10,23
30,"Fantastic Rooms, Intercontinental Breakfast!","Booked this hotel on a random trip to Barcelona as found a fantastic cost effective deal on groupon which I have not seen since. Getting around in Barcelona is not difficult as many things are within close proximity with one another. This hotel was a 5 minute walk to the nearest station, it is great if you don't mind an extra 15-30 minute journey into central Barcelona if you are on a holiday trip it is great if you are travelling with people who don't walking-maybe a little inconvenient if you have young children. But either way you will feel relaxed coming back to spend the night here as the beds are very comfy, the hotel interior is modern, there are big windows in the rooms with technology such as bose players you can connect your ipods/phones to for music. You can adjust the lighting in the room to suit you. There is a sub section within the rooms in which there are spacious cupboards with safes and enough space to hide your suitcases so they are not in the way. There is a wet washroom shower that is very powerful. The rooms are sound proof and you can choose if you want a smoke free or smoke room. You can also enjoy free facilities such as the spa and swimming area. There are different restaurants within the hotel at different levels. Overall I would definitely stay here again and would also recommend it to family and friends. There is also a shuttle service that takes you into one of the central locations from where you can get on a bus tour (bus tours are highly recommended as it gave me a snap shot of Barcelona in one day at my own pace).",5,2015,10,21
30,Terrible customer service!,"We chose to stay here to ensure we got a good restful day and evening before our flight. Everything about it has been disappointing. We arrived at 11:30am and were told that none of their 280 rooms were available unless we wanted to pay $110 extra. We informed them that we would stay in the lobby and to please notify us when a room was ready. It took over 3hrs and its only when we kept seeing people checking in that they suddenly found a room for us. The receptionists were not very helpful and seemed lost. To add to all this, we found out that the advertised pool for this hotel is only accessible for an extra 14 ‚Ç¨ per person!!! This should be clarified on the website as it is very misleading!!!
I would not recommend staying here.",1,2015,10,21
30,nice hotel,"The hotel itself is nice and beautiful. Rooms were clean and had a nice view of the city although the decoration was a little odd with the door of the room opening first to the bathroom area and then to the room, however, modern architecture is a hallmark of barcelona. breakfast was various and delicious and all the staff were polite and helpful. Hotel was quiet and relaxing. The hotel is not far from air port, about 10 minutes by taxi. Free wifi were available. The only disadvantage of this hotel was long distance from city center or beach area and shopping centers, so this hotel is more convenient for business trips. It would have been nice if shuttle bus were available to and from city center. The area really does not offer a great choice of restaurants or supermarkets. 
overall, I liked this hotel and I had a nice stay there.",4,2015,10,19
30,Amazing room,"This is a very lovely hotel in many ways. The room I stayed in was enormous and the bed was ever so comfy. The view was really spectacular over the whole of Barcelona. Excellent shower with fancy jets. Sofa, tv, iPod docking station which were all very useful. The location is good for airport and there is a free shuttle that runs at certain times. Staff were helpful and on hand whenever I had a question or request. 
On the downside the location is at the end of a metro line and you have to walk through a car park to get to the hotel. The gym is amazing and so is the pool, sadly though these were charged additionally and not included in the room rate. 
I would stay here again as A treat because just loved the room so much.  ",4,2015,10,18
30,Great last night in Spain,"We checked into the hotel about 10:45pm and it was convenient to get to coming from the metro from the city center. You go to the last stop on the metro heading towards the airport from the city center and was a 3 minute walk from the station. 

Check in was fast and we were in our room on the 16th floor within 10 minutes of arriving. After spending two weeks in Airbnbs, a hotel room with nice towels and a huge bathroom was a sight for sore eyes. The shower was incredible. Best waterfall shower head I've ever experienced. It also had two other shower options that were also equally nice. 

The room is very modern with lots of mirrors and the large towel for the floor was perfect as I image the stone floor could be slippery. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion were all provided. The bed was a bit too firm and the pillows a bit too flat so I didn't sleep great but the blackout curtains were nice. 

The wifi seemed fairly descent and they had shuttle times to the airport posted in the lobby and gave us a print out of times. They all were about 40 min apart so 8:40a, 9:20a, etc. We were promptly downstairs at 8:37 and had to wait until 8:43 for the driver to arrive at the black shuttle is parked out front. My fianc√© and I were the only ones waiting. The driver was friendly and we arrived at the airport about 10 minutes later. 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel for being close to the airport. I'd probably even recommend it for a home base while visiting Barcelona if you didn't mind a lengthy metro ride every day back to your room because of how cheap our room was. It was 13 stops from the El Born district but it wasn't longer than 20 minutes. We didn't get to enjoy any other features of the hotel but they did look nice.",4,2015,10,18
30,Innovative room design,Near the airport but otherwise not good location. Nothing around it - far from city center. Very good conference facilities. Room on 12th floor - apparantenly renovated into very modern shape - excellent shower and innovative bathroom/dressing room concept,4,2015,10,18
30,Probably great for business not so great for Holiday Stay,"This probably was 5* when it first opened, in my opinion it is now about a 3* it is well worn, think it opened in 2006 and doesn't feel like it's been updated since. For business it's probably good, just outside Barcelona, just off a busy main road, across from a hospital (you can't hear the ambulances in your room) & near the airport with a conference centre attached, the additional pool & gym facilities which are added costs would be perfect for business. We had a 2 night stay (mini holiday) booked via a topsecretdeal and we were given room 1113, no shower door, water all over the bathroom area, stained carpets, and they remove the kettle. And from reading other reviews I can now see this is normal practise if you book a deal. We could pay an extra 5 euro for a kettle and an extra 12 euro for kettle cups and brewing facilities!? And I thought it a bit deceiving that the Evo rotating restaurant on the top floor still shown on the website has been closed for 3 years, you can't go up to see the views. The shuttle bus to and from the beach, airport, town centre is for the first 8 people in the queue and is first come first served. To and from airport at breakfast and tea times, we landed at 12 and would have had to wait till 5 for the shuttle, not knowing if we weren't at the front of the queue we would be left behind. However, the Metro (which you get in the hospital grounds) from the hotel to town centre is easy to use, 10 journeys for 10 euros, you can share the ticket, and the hotel is the last stop on the line, it's just that bit too far out, if you wanted to nip back to the hotel to freshen up get changed and go back out after tea, it's a bit of a hassle 20-30 minutes each way. They have a NH hotel in the centre of Barcelona on Las Ramblas this looked a more modern up to date hotel!?? Might be worth trying if you are in Barcelona for the sights??",3,2015,10,17
30,Business at Hesperia Tower,"We were hosting a 250 People conference at Hesperia Tower and I (as the main organizer) was very satisfied with the perfect organization! The banquet sales and service team were always available and ready to fulfil special wishes. They were flexible to changes and reacted friendly and promptly to anything I addressed. Thanks so much again!! The food was awesome in taste, huge in quantity and very nicely presented. Meeting rooms are spacious and have good technical equipment. Guestrooms are very spacious (especially the bathrooms) and the beds are really comfy. Everything was well cleaned. Still, some renovation work should be done for a hotel in that category (and price). The front desk definitely needs a bit more friendliness in stressful situations and please some more english speaking colleagues. All over, I had a very nice stay at Hesperia Tower and a successful conference.",4,2015,10,16
30,Great business hotel,"This is a great business hotel -- easy access to airport, spacious and luxurious rooms, lots of quiet and abundant work space in room so you can get a lot of work done in the evening, fine restaurant on premises for work meetings, outstanding health club directly adjacent to hotel -- I was really happy to discover this hotel and will definitely stay here when I return for business. I would imagine that it would be a great place for touring as well -- a metro ride from the city, but certainly a nice place to come back to at night. ANd, again, so close to airport.",5,2015,10,14
30,Very average hotel,"This is a basic three star - nothing more.
Check In was nothing more than adequate with no offer of information on tourist aspects. The hotel is situated quite a way out of the city and we were already prepared to splash out on taxis each way (‚Ç¨30 a time) but some advice on the tram / underground route would have been appreciated.
Our room (218) had stains on the carpet and was indeed torn (which was a trip hazard) near the bathroom.
The bar where we had an enjoyable evening on our first evening (Friday 9th) was staffed by some older gentlemen and whilst I know there is a language barrier, a smile would go a long way. A young man and am ashamed to say I can't remember his name, was a delight and the highlight of our stay and his colleagues in this area could learn a lot.
We returned to this bar on Saturday night but the area is also used for diners and was taken up by a large tour - they were on their last night and were therefore very noisy. Why they were not given a different room I do not know. We left the bar much earlier than we intended due to this problem.
Breakfast was an average buffet and we encountered no members of staff whatsoever.
Have not stayed in a nH hotel before and if this is standard, I suspect we won't again.",3,2015,10,14
30,Hosted a Conference for 150,"***Writing this review as an event planner that hosted a conference at the Hesperia Tower Hotel***

I was extremely happy with the Hesperia Tower.  We hosted a two day conference for 150 guests and we had a wonderful time working with the Convention Services Team.  

The property is absolutely gorgeous.  A downside of staying at the Hesperia is that it is quite a hike from the city center, but that translates to some great opportunities for savings on rooms per night and can be assuaged with a quick walk to the subway into the city.  

The Meeting Venue, AV Services, and Catering were all really high quality.  The guest rooms were beautiful - but there were a few of our guests that reported some foul odors in their rooms, and they only offered air fresheners to take care of those smells.  

The Shuttle service driver was really rude.  Not a good experience there, but that was the only negative I have for the service.  Otherwise, the entire staff was attentive, had a great grasp on multiple languages, and made it easy to stay at the Hesperia.  99% Thrilled with the staff.  

Also - the Fantasia of Red Berries at the Restaurant and in room service was INCREDIBLE! 

A lot of really great experiences at the Hesperia Tower.  Looking forward to visiting again someday!",4,2015,10,14
30,Great hotel with very helpful staff,"Hotel very local to the airport and when we pulled up in the taxi we were a little sceptical as the outside of the hotel doesn't give the impression of a 5 star,  we arrived about 11am which was way to early to check in, however the lady that greeted us from reception took our bags and helped us with local maps of the area so that we could go an explore before being able to check in at 3pm.  Used the hotel shuttle service to take us into town and came back on the Metro which was really easy to use.
We arrived back at the hotel to check in and was greeted by Nicolas who was extremely helpful and went out of his way to provide us with information about local events that were taking place and also the best way of using the Metro service, Nicolas offered us an upgrade to a suite as we had asked if we could have a good view and even showed us around the suite and hotel personally before we agreed.  The room (on the 21st floor) was lovely and the view over Barcelona was amazing, the metro and shops were less than 2 minutes from the hotel which included restaurants, supermarkets and various other shops which we used frequently and took the goods back to the hotel.
We had dinner in the hotel and found all the staff in the restaurants to be extremely pleasant and helpful as were all staff we came across from the breakfast dining room to reception including the cleaning staff.  We had drinks in the hotel bar and was offered a discounted rate for the spa throughout our stay although we did not take this up as we had no spare time on our visit.  
Although the hotel is not in central Barcelona the Metro service was amazing and very cheap (less than 75p a journey) for which we travelled the length and breadth of Barcelona to take in all the sites which had stations within yards of everywhere we wanted to visit and the trains were the most punctual and efficient mode of transport we could have used.
All in all we found the hotel and all the staff to be very friendly, helpful which made our stay as lovely as the rooms and service we experienced, and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2015,10,09

30,Great hotel,"Booked two rooms with a colleague for a work trip and stayed for two nights. This hotel is located outside Barcelona's city centre. It is on the metro line (30min to plaza Catalunya), and there is also a bus to the airport, 15min. 
Our rooms were on the 22nd floor. Yet, modern efficient operating system for the elevators, with pre selection of floor, meant there was minimum wait and hassle. Two of the elevators had glass on the outer side, so one could admire the views on the ascend/descent, though not so keen on that myself! 
The room was spacious and modern, with excellent shower and plenty of storage areas. Very comfortable bed. Free wifi and coffee making facilities. A very pleasant room.
The room was premium, and although this was not mentioned on the website, it came with access to Tower premium lounge, a superbly decorated lounge with free supply of good quality snacks (cheeses/olives/breads etc), cakes, croissants and all sort of drinks, including sparkling wine and spirits. We enjoyed  breakfast, lunch and after dinner drinks there, all very satisfying. It was also extremely quiet, only one or two other people at any time, which made it even more attractive for a relaxing break or an informal meeting.
We tried the restaurant, and the food was excellent, very good quality and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was very relaxing. The staff was friendly and helpful.
Overall a very pleasant experience. Although there is nothing to do near this hotel there is plenty to do in it, there is also a spa and a gym. If you are looking for a hotel in that area, I would definitely recommend this one.",5,2015,10,05
30,"Luxorious, with great gym facility, but somewhart isolated","I travel to Barcelona for business with some frequency and normally stay in town. I stayed here during my most recent trip since I had an early morning flight and wanted to be near airport. I was surprised by how luxurious the hotel was, but, even more so, by the health club right next door, to which guests have full privileges. One of the best gyms I have ever been to -- 25m pool, great weight and aerobics spaces, friendly staff and clientele. Overall, if you don't mind being a metro ride from town, I would highly recommend this hotel And, as a bonus, restaurant is quite OK for dinner. I thought that the entire staff was helpful and competent and did not share the experience at all of some of those who I see complained. Check it out and try the fitness club!",5,2015,10,04
30,"Badly placed, expensive and terrible customer care","If you have never been to a five-star hotel before, you might be impressed but if you are used to them, you might no be so happy. I arrived at the hotel with the expectation that it would be equal or, better than other, 5-star hotels that I usually stay at while on business trips. I could not have been more mistaken: Firstly, it is located in the middle of nowhere, beside an electronic superstore and 5 minutes away from some small stores and cheap, local restaurants and NOTHING else. To get anywhere requires taking a taxi. However, one I checked in, I saw the real side of the hotel. For medical reasons, I have to use rice milk instead of other types. When I checked in, I told the reception staff about this need and they confirmed that they had it and there would be no problems at breakfast time. A total lie - there was none available at breakfast and no hot drink for me. I also asked to be given a wake-up call for 6:45h as I had to make a series of business-related international phone and Skype calls - I was not called at the time required which resulted in serious financial loss and possible future contracts. Obviously, I complained to the director of the hotel and his response was a brief note, A pathetically small plate of fruit and a bottle of rice milk in the minibar. He made no effort to contact me personally which indicates a total lack of interest in customer complaints.
The restaurant where breakfasts are served is a dark, badly-lit ""cave"" which does not seem to be an appropriate place to help guests to start the day. The buffet is extensive but does not compensate for the environment. 
Would I return to this hotel? NO WAY!  Would I recommend it? Only to an enemy. Should tourists stay there? - As a tourist I would not!",2,2015,10,02
30,It's nice but not 5 star!,"Nice hotel. Looks modern although has some wear and tear. 
Check in was quick. Room was nice with a great view from the 19th floor.

A bit odd that a kettle and coffee/tea facilities are not provided in the room. First hotel that I've ever seen missing these!!

The rooms have TVs but lack many international channels.

Breakfast buffet is good but at ‚Ç¨25 per person is perhaps a little too expensive for the quality provided.
",3,2015,09,29
30,Horrific! !,"The big issue with this hotel and I mean BIG is the ignorance of the staff... the restaurant manager in particular is simply the most ignorant and rude person I've ever had the misfortune of encountering in my whole life... staff are snobby and elitist and treat you like something scraped from the bottom of their shoe. Hotel itself is nice but is showing signs of age food is good in the restaurant  (we were refused service the second night as we turned up improperly dressed... hardly our fault as we were stranded here due to the air traffic controllers strike) the buffet though was poor and the food often cold or repeated. The real gem is the residential area close by with lots of little bars, patisseries and shops and some very friendly and welcoming people. ",2,2015,09,28
30,Nice view but quite outcentered,"We spent a week end in Barcelona for a family wedding and managed to found a very good deal at 80 euros per night approx. The Hotel is modern but not new (must be 10 years old?). Rooms are good with a nice bathroom (without bathtube). What is weird is that the door of the room opens on the bath room. So if you are naked and your wife comes from outside, anyone can see you naked from the corridor...! Strange. Other wise, bed is average but view is stunning. The hotel is 30mn from the town center by the subway. Which is a little painful when we stayed 3 nights.",4,2015,09,25
30,Luxus Hotel ,"The hotel is a little far away from the city but taking the metro shouldn't be a problem. They have a shuttle which takes you to the plaza Catalu√±a and to the airport. Ask for the schedule. The room was great. Clean and styled. Lots of soccer teams stay here. If you have luck you could meet the real madrid or athletic
 We meet levante de Valencia. I would stay again here üòä.",4,2015,09,21
30,Overnight stay,"The hotel is pretty modern and comfortable, food was brought promptly and there is a fair selection wine the menu.  We checked in around 10 PM everything seemed fine, although there was a slight shortage of king-size bed's, so it may be worth booking in advance to ensure you get king-size if you want. It was around 25¬∞C at this time of night-The Aircon worked very well

The room has a mini bar and several options to facilitate mood lighting

The hotel itself is about a 10 minute drive from Barcelona airport any taxi's cost roughly ‚Ç¨20 and there appears to be a queuing system directed by lead attendant .",4,2015,09,20
30,Bad Check- In Experience,"Hesperia Tower in Barcelona is a nice, modern &  luxurious hotel but all these is tarnished by its poor Reception staff & incomplete basic amenities upon check-in. First of all, the Reception guy placed us in a Smoking room even if we didnt request a smoking room which was at the farthest end of the hallway & pretended he didnt know it was a smoking room.When I begged him for a Non- smoking room as I am an asthmatic, he again pretended there was no other room available. We also noticed there was no complimentary coffee, tea or water & shower cap available. The glass door was also missing. Were we given this room because we booked online at a discounted rate thru one of the  booking partners/ agencies of Trip Advisor? I hope not... True enough after staying in the room for 2 hours I started to develop an asthma attack. This time I requested that we be transferred asap to a Non- Smoking Room to prevent a full blown asthma attack and suddenly there was  a room available at 2am even if it was unusual for it to be available because of someone checking out at 2am. I am presuming that when we checked in, the Reception guy intended to give us a Smoking Room, a room number of 13 & a room at the farthest end of the hallway. The room they transferred us to at 2am was the same but lo & behold, it has coffee, tea & complimentary water & the glass door was not missing. Well maybe this is the kind of room they give us in return for the discounted room rate online but it just isnt fair, right?",2,2015,09,17
30,beautiful hotel ,"hotel is around 10 mins from airport, do not use a taxi, they'll  charge you minimum 25 euros when the hotel is less than 10 mins away and the 46 bus will take you straight to hotel for 2 euros.

Interior of hotel is stunning, well kept, rooms are lovely, clean,  very quiet area and beds very comfy. loved the rainfall shower especially! Tea and coffee were available in the room which I was happy about but didn't use the mini bar or the room service as the seemed too expensive.
Had a look at the health club facilities but didn't feel it was worth the extra 14 euros to use an indoor pool and sauna when you was in sunny Barcelona and I certainly had no intention in using a gym whilst on holiday! 
Really enjoyed my stay at the hotel but next time I'll pick somewhere more central as I spent too much time going back and forth on the metro ( if you use the metro get 1 ticket with 10 trips on it that costs 10 euros and both of you can use the same ticket ) saves a fortune! For business travellers it's perfect location but for sightseers it can be a bit of a pain as there's nothing to see in the surrounding area of the hotel. 
lastly the staff were brilliant, made us feel very welcome, any questions I had , they had the answers for so I'd like to thank them for making my stay in your beautiful hotel enjoyable! ",4,2015,09,13
30,Nicely located near airport ,"An odd looking building from the outside but a great hotel. Only stayed one night however a great experience. Didn't manage to take advantage of all facilities but tried the fine dining restaurant. Great food and service and friendly, attentive staff. We had an early flight so couldn't take advantage of the free shuttle but taxi's are available early in the morning even at 4 am. Roughly 25 euros to the airport terminal 1/2. Would stay again. ",4,2015,09,12
30,In the middle of nowhere!,"Ok, perhaps an exaggeration, but it is indeed located between the airport and downtown Barcelona. There is a metro stop about a 5-8 minutes walk away which takes you about 30 minutes and 15 stops to get you to Catalunya, the heart of town.
Room is decent. The aircon and WiFi works well. I found the person at reception ,Brian, to be informative and helpful. He checked us in promptly even though we arrived at about 10:30 am. 
The king size bed is actually 2 twin beds pushed together and it isn't the most comfortable of beds. My pet peeve is that they don't provide any bottles of water and I wasn't about to pay 5 Euros for a bottle either. 
Since they don't have a concierge desk, they don't provide any stamps either for my postcards. I was directed to a local tobacco store across from Media Markt(which happened to be closed!)

Tip: Walk to the high rise residential buildings across from Media Markt and buy a 1.5L bottle of water for .21 Euro. There is also a pretty decent bakery/cafe one could have a nice breakfast without paying 25 Euros at the hotel! 

All in all, I would give this place a pass. Would pick a location much closer to town if you are a tourist visiting Barcelona for the first time. ",2,2015,09,12
30,Good Value,"We booked this deal on lastminute.com. The reviews said it was 5 star, but for us, it was more a 4 star hotel. Very modern, architectural style of hotel. Yes you have to pay for the pool, for us ,this is not 5 star. The rooms were very nice, although ours had a strong smell of tobacco. The bathrooms are very good, with nice complimentaries. The beds were very comfortable & the wifi is very good.
The hotel is a bit far from the city, but there is a very nearby train station, maybe 20-30 mins to the city, there are taxis available outside. They also have a shuttle service to the city, beaches etc, but be warned, there are not many seats available on the shuttle, so its first come first serve, so I wouldn't count on this service exclusively. If you want a hotel close to the airport, this would be great. I think it is more for business travellers",3,2015,09,12
30,Good for business travel,"I was staying in Barcelona for business. This hotel offers good service and awesome internet super fat and no charge. Hotel front desk staff were awesome! Lobby, restaurants all nice. My room was on 11th floor. I am a clean freak so getting off the elevator and seeing stained carpet wasn't so great. My room was adequate. Stains on the carpet though, and just looked a bit worn out. However bathroom was very spacious and the rain shower was amazing! Location was right next to convention center so for what I had to do great choice. However, for site seeing and being close to any attractions not so great. I needed to take a cab even to get to restaurants. Basically nothing around hotel. But, to get to airport literally 10 minutes.
I would say this is a 3 star hotel and good business option if you need to be working by conventions center, need high speed internet and want a clean room.
One additional comment. They have access to one of the best fitness centers I have ever stayed at during a business trip. Top notch . Downside they want 14 Euros a day.",3,2015,09,10
30,WOW,"This hotel was chosen because of it's proximity to the airport and a late arriving flight. They offer shuttle transport from the airport until 9 PM. I had to take a cab but I sure did not regret my night there.
Modern, almost post-modern, architecture and decor. Excellent restaurant, with service accordingly, gorgeous room (we were upgraded to a suite). You will read reviews about paying extra for the gym and pool, being away from everything ... But if you want a relaxing night, after a long ( or short flight ), this is the place. By far the best ""close to the airport"" hotel I have ever been.",5,2015,09,09
30,More a convention center than a hotel,"Pros : good wifi, near airport, good room overall
Cons : Surely not a 5 star hotel (my guess is : expect a 3 stars service), not so good bed, restaurant price (~ 25-30 euro per plate)

In short : no valet, no help for the luggages, have to wait tu get the room (and got a 2 twins bed room instead of a king as reserved... It seemed that they have offered too many late check-out and asked us to wait more than an hour for the room... or to pay 60 euro for an upgrade !).  Also, one of the twin beds was very noisy just when sitting on it, kinda need an upgrade there ! Overall, it was the worst 5 stars service received (it wasn't an horrible experience... it was just disappointing when you expect more from that hotel category).

I can't tell for the convention services but I can recommend this for a tourist : don't stay more than 1 night at this hotel (airplane arrival or departure), don't expect a good service and don't pay more than you would for a 4 stars hotel for your stay. Plan a 60-80 euro for the dinner for two (you will eat good food... overpriced but good). So, for the same price than a 4 stars hotel, it's ""okay"". If you got a price cheaper than that, it may be a better deal. Oh... and bring your own water bottles, 5 euro for a 50 cl is quite expensive !",2,2015,09,05
30,Great Value,"We stayed here after our cruise. I wanted to be close to the airport for a morning flight. We had an all day tour that picked us up from the cruise port and dropped us and our luggage off at the hotel. The hotel is modern, clean and beautiful. The bathroom and shower are large and modern. The staff was very nice. We ate at the hotel and loved the food. There is a light breakfast in the lobby. The only thing I would change was the airport shuttle. It does not start until 7:30 so we had to get a cab with was 20 Euro. I prepaid for this hotel through Expedia and it was a very good deal.",5,2015,09,04
30,Pre-cruise Stay,"Since our flight was arriving late and having visited beautiful Barcelona before, we opted to stay close to the airport and take a cab to the cruise port terminal the next morning. The hotel offers a free airport shuttle but this is not a 24 hour shuttle service so be sure and check their timetable. Due to a flight delay, we barely missed the cut-off time and they declined pick up. Check-in was easy. Yes, they spoke English. This hotel fit all the requirements for our pre-cruise stay. Taxi cabs were waiting for passengers outside the hotel. No, we did not have to wait in a queue. It was a weekend day so traffic was light and it was a short drive to the cruise port.

If you plan on staying several days and sightseeing around Barcelona, the location of this hotel might not be ideal. You would probably want to stay around La Rambla or the Gothic Quarter. However, if you require a pre-cruise stay or close proximity to the airport, Hesperia Tower will definitely work .",4,2015,09,03
30,Good service on arrival; good conference hotel; good for airport,"I'm staying here because of a conference which was run here.

Overall impression is good; I love my room (great view of Barcelona), very helpful service on the first day when I arrived on an early morning flight before my room was ready. 

It's outside the centre of Barcelona; I actually liked that because when you wander around, it feels like a place people live, not just a tourist destination.The metro is just over the road so it's no problem to get down the centre if that's what you want.",4,2015,09,02
30,not 5 stars,"We are staying in a suite at the Hesperia Towers. The hotel is very comfortable, and we knew that its position meant that we needed to travel into the city. 
The suites are comfortable, but not 5 star by UK standards, by a number of minor, but very irritating things:

1) In my experience, health club facilities are included in 5 star, not some ‚Ç¨42 per night extra for a family of 3
2) Coffee in the rooms should be free, not ‚Ç¨7
3) TV's are normally in every bedroom

There are other issues, and much of the hotel is very nice and comfortable, but all in all not 5 stars!, not even a uk 4star",3,2015,09,02
30,Ok until the metal towel rail fell off and broke my Mam's toe!,"Definitely not a 5 star hotel, features such as electric curtains and computerised lifts doesn't make a hotel 5 star. It is close to the airport but is 15 mins from the city centre and the shuttle only holds 8 people; barely worth bothering with as it is always full! The breakfast buffet was good but the service you received off staff varied on each morning but Gulraiz deserves a mention as he was fantastic! Good views from the bedroom windows over the city and the rooms are clean and contemporary.
Warning: anyone that stays here should be very careful of the metal towel rail that is I front of the sink basin. It is exceptionally heavy, solid metal and stuck on with glue! This fell off on our last morning and landed on my Mam's toe! It cut, bruised and since had it rayed and discovered a broken bone! We did contact the hotel but no one spoke English that came so a first aider put some iodine on it and left! Ruined our last day and not even a sorry from the staff! Very poor considering it is an obvious fault on their behalf, didn't even offer a taxi ride, free drink, nothing. Poor from a 5 star hotel that is supposed to out the customer first! I would like to make one exception and that is Roger on the front desk he was very polite and friendly. Overall a very disappointing service from a 5 star hotel and yes I agree with other reviews that the photos are misleading and you have to pay extra for the pool and even for a kettle! 12 euros for the kettle and 14 euros per person per day for the pool that is in a separate building! Will not be staying again and will not be recommending to friends.",2,2015,09,01
30,Great place to stay and close to the airport,"We spent the night here before a early morning flight.  Very close to the airport.  Modern rooms and great views of the city.  We had a room on one of the upper floors and the views were amazing.  I thought this was a good value for the rate and fit our needs.  I wouldn't use this as a home base for discovering Barcelona, it wouldn't be a good location for that.",4,2015,08,31
30,Excellent Room,"This is advertised as 5 star and I would say it is for the quality of the rooms. They are 1st class. I paid ¬£65 per room so for Premier Inn prices this should b 6 star!! Realistically I'd say this is a very good 4 star compared to five stars in uk, but for the money I'm not going to complain. I'd go again without issue.",4,2015,08,30
30,Irreproachable service and excellent rooms,"The hotel is very contemporary, the decoration is modern and beautiful. 
The service was kind, thoughtful and very resourceful. We asked our receptionist about places to visit, about the metro and train stations and he knew everything!
We took our breakfast/brunch at the hotel buffet. There was a lot of choices and the quality was very good. 

Finally the rooms were spacious and quiet, the beds comfortable and the bathrooms were huge!!  Everything was very clean and neat.

I really recommend the place: it is not too far from Barcelona and from the airport (about 20 min in metro to Pl Catalunya, and half an hour bus to El Prat)",5,2015,08,26
30,Beatiful room with a view,"This was a beatiful modern hotel with a view of the city, that was gorgeous by night, but rather depressing by day.
The staff could not find our reservation when we came in very late at night after a delayed flight, and told us the hotel was fully booked and there was no room for us , then left us and told us they could give us a wificode so we could arrange something for ourself. 
We totally panicked, and tried to let them find our reservation, after half an hour they did find it and apologized for the misunderstanding and upgraded our room, but did not accompanied or helped us with our luggage to that room , not the reaction you expected from a 5 star hotel.
The room was beautiful but a bit shabby, curtains were torn , and lamps were hanging half out of the cupboard . Staff could have been more helpfull, or attending to us in our need, why did they say that they were fully booked in the first place and then upgraded our room later?",4,2015,08,21
30,Excellent service and gorgeous place to stay,"The hotel was amazing and the staff very nice and helpful! Lovely stay. Looking forward to going back there!
Perfect place to stay if you are flying early in the morning! It‚Äôs just 10 minutes away from the airport. Have fun finding the right elevator for your room :P and enjoy the view!",5,2015,08,20
30,"Good, clean, professional business hotel.","Everything was as expected, off peak basic room rate reasonable with everything like breakfast and swimming, in particular, rather annoyingly, as extra costs. No complaints although I think it would have been nice if they could have let me check in slightly earlier since they were not so busy rather than make me wait until their check in time muttering rooms not ready! They did however, try to sell me an immediately ""available"" suite upgrade package but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Excellent shower and room facilities. Would probably stay again when in Barcelona for business. Useful complimentary small shuttle mini-bus to airport with a very friendly and helpful driver. ( I left early morning so no space issue)",4,2015,08,19
30,Hotel stay,"Our idea of a five star hotel isn't quite the Spanish view, this is a very good four star hotel at best. It extensively is a business class hotel,and the decor is more to suit that form of client√®le than the holiday maker, but all very clean and the rooms are very nice indeed. We stayed a week. Although a bit out of town it is a minute away from the metro station and you will in the city centre in around 15 minutes. I recommend it for the person not able to afford the central prices but definitely wants a clean and stylish room and great bathroom.",4,2015,08,19
30,Believe the positives...........,"We arrived from the airport, getting a cab from outside which cost 20 euros. Make sure you have an address for the hotel though!!

Checked in very quickly and politely. Gentleman suggested things to do until our room was ready at 3pm. 

We headed to metro station (hospital de belvitge) which was three minute walk, basically across the road in the hospital car park. We bought a three day travel pass for around 25 euros each. Well worth it. Metro is very easy and simple to navigate. 

Came back at 4 to get our key. We were served by Eric, who greeted us as if we were royalty, felt very special. The manager then came out to introduce himself and offer his services. A really lovely touch. 

Our bags were taken to,our rooms on floor 23!!! The man who took them was again jolly and very interested in Us, our journey, where we were from etc. he showed us our room and where everything was. 

Our room was fabulous. Walked in to a bathroom/cloakroom area.  Black tiled floor, gowns available and plenty of space. The room itself was spacious. With a big TV and a floor to ceiling window. Couch in front of window with views of the Olympic village, Tibidabo (well worth a visit), nou camp ( if you look hard enough) and Barcelona itself. Never seen such a good view!!

Had dinner in hotel on first night. Gorgeous. Reasonable price too. We had a kettle in the roof and coffee making facilities. 

Used metro a lot. Visited sagrida familia (wow!!), the beach and th musical fountain. 

We are coming back to this hotel in a week and can't wait. We may try to upgrade to a more superior room, although the one we had was brilliant. 

Loved the hotel, the location, the staff..
The positive reviews are spot on. The negative ones I can't understand. Some people are just never happy!!!!

We will definitely recommend this hotel. Thank you to the manager and the staff for making us feel so very special.",5,2015,08,14
30,Real cool,"It is just the architecture and the styling that makes this hotel a ""must see"". very very cool, great lobby, great corridors and stylish rooms. it¬¥s a pleasure just to be there and see, feel, enjoy. If you catch a discount rate for under 150 ‚Ç¨ it¬¥s really worth the money. Some disadvantages: lift too slow, waiting time up to 5 min. Nothing to do or within walking in the area, just a Media Market.",5,2015,08,12
30,Lovely. Easy journey into town. ,"Very nice hotel, lovely service, great views. Near the tube, and a quick journey into town. Really enjoyed my stay here. Look up local restaurants, there's a local pizza place that's great! Don't get a cab from airport, it's a minimum 20 euro for a short journey. Jump on the bus or time to get the hesperia tower shuttle. Only 8 seats though. Enjoy barcelona it's beautiful.",5,2015,08,12
30,Pleasurable stay,"Was not a bad stay at the hotel, although the restaurant on the top floor is out of use unless you hire it out for functions, which was not stated when booked. This hotel is approx 15 min drive from catalunya centre with all the shops. They have a little complimentary 8 seater shuttle to the city and airport throughout the day, the receptionist will give you a timetable, but be warned you need to queue early to get on the bus. The staff were friendly and polite. There is nothing  at all around this hotel apart from industrial park, hospital and loads of run down estates, not pretty. The good thing is there is a metro station, ‚Ç¨2.00 per journey. We ate in 4th floor restaurant good service food of good quality, decor lovely.  When we checked out we had to pay ‚Ç¨4.50 per apparantly city tax whatever that is. We stayed there for 5 day on the whole it was pleasurable stay. ",4,2015,08,10
30,The only hotel I have stayed that has met the most of my expectations and then some!,"Very comfortable and spacious rooms. Beds, linens, couches in the rooms are comfortable. The hotel is super modern. Not my style but I respect it and see it is beautiful in its own right. The bathrooms are really cool and have a dizzying funhouse effect. It is wall to ceiling mirrors so you get disoriented quickly and not sure if you are entering in the closet, shower or toilet! My kids thought was cool and entertaining. They liked the electric curtains in the bedroom of course. They also have a great restaurant that we ate at. food was excellent. Metro is near by so can get to other areas of Barcelona quickly and safely. Car can be parked in underground car park which is an extra fee. Great view of the surrounding area as the hotel is very tall with many floors. The elevators are state of the art. They are preprogramed to the floor you want to go. As you walk around the hotel the visual effects of depth and color is stunning. ",5,2015,08,09
30,Helpful Staff Made This High-rise Hotel Work for Us,"Booked this because it is halfway between downtown and airport. Free shuttle to airport early in the morning was a big plus, we were the only passengers but note the shuttle van only seats 8 so we had to wait for next trip on our previous downtown trip. Staff including the shuttle driver were very interested in helping, especially with advice about watching out for pickpockets and baggage thiefs. Nice modern fairly new hotel. They allowed us to check in early. Our room could have used a more comfortable bed.",4,2015,08,07
30,Read the small print,"Great bedrooms however NEVER 5 star. You pay for everything, including a kettle which comes with 6 tea bags, guess what top ups are EXTRA 5 euros. A small coffee is available for 4 euro each. RIP OFF

When checking out was informed I had to pay COUNCIL TAX which was a big shock and as its a 5 star hotel the tax is EXPENSIVE. Landed myself with an extra 40 euros on top of price just for council tax. Leisure is overpriced at 14 euros each. ",3,2015,08,07
30,True 5 star luxury! Best Hotel I've ever stayed in!,"We arrived here on our way back home, unfortunately only staying for 2 nights. We were upgraded to a suite on the 23rd floor, which was a beautiful and comfortable room. I would say it was the nicest room I've ever stayed in, and the hotel itself was quite possibly the best hotel I've stayed in. The service was great, the location, while out of the centre of the city, is quite nice. In the city, it is fairly loud, while it was very quiet here. Obviously there is some travel time involved to get to all of the attraction, but the metro is not very expensive and the station is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Definitely a place I'd go out of my way to stay at again, and I would recommend strongly. That goes for the bouquet restaurant as well, excellent service and amazing food!",5,2015,08,06
30,Restuarant Azimut (Breakfast),"Nice atmosphere and d√©cor, good views outside through large floor to ceiling windows, very attentive and helpful staff and great variety of breakfast options to suit all tastes, no rush to finish, good start to any day.",5,2015,07,31
30,"Decent hotel, poor location, never five star.","Stayed at this hotel for about a week. 

It is a fair bit out of town (half way between airport and city centre) but is very close to the metro and has good bus links. The hotel also runs a free shuttle into town, the airport and the beach in Gava but it only seats 8 and so often people are left behind. Not very good for a five star hotel, bigger minibus would help. Our room was very comfortable but showing signs of wear and tear (expect $6 bottle of water from mini-bar not to be at room temperature). Also, there is no outside terrace, no pool and very small bar that isn‚Äôt that great. And there is nothing close to the hotel. 

The staff are very friendly. 

In summary, not a great location and not convinced by any means that it is a five star hotel. But if you can get a deal for $60-90 a night probably decent value. ",3,2015,07,30
30,Ok Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel from Jul 24 to Jul 26. It located 4-5 kms from the airport and metro is at walkable distance. Everthing is charged!! Even a kettle. They don't give you a kettle also when we asked for it they said its 12 euros.. Not expected from a ""5 star hotel""..",3,2015,07,30
30,Worst 5star stay ever.,"We booked superior view, king bed, non-smoking room and paid extra for that. Apparently hotel was overbooked and staff tried to put us in a smoking room, explaining that ""non-smoking"" is an optional feature depending on availability. When we refused, they tried to put us in a room with separate beds, and finally downgraded us to room on lower floor with parking lot view (after intense exchange they admitted that it is a downgrade, but refused to compensate for the difference). They also admitted that there are available rooms of better quality if we pay extra for upgrade (which we refused). By the time we figured out the room situation, all the food places in the tower were closed. There are no food places near it and at night you left with your fridge bar in the room with $8 M&Ms and $7 0.2l orange juice bottles. In the morning restaurant opened late, so we could not get breakfast before going to the airport to catch our early plain. Worst 5star stay ever. Still trying to get reimbursement for room downgrade.",1,2015,07,28
30,Very disappointing! ,"We booked the Hesperia Tower for the last night of our holiday. We had stayed for three nights in central Barcelona and four nights in Tossa de Mar. We were excited to stay at the hotel for our last night as we wanted to relax and enjoy the view and eat in the rooftop restaurant. The hotel also advertised a free shuttle to and from Barcelona and the airport. We called the hotel on our day of arrival to be told the shuttle only ran at certain times. Therefore we had to cart our luggage on a bus and walk through an under pass which wasn't a great start. On arrival the room was pleasant with an excellent view and a great bed but there were elements of the room which were definitely not 5 star quality including a big stain on the carpet. 

The restaurant was closed so we could not even go and look at the view. So we headed into Barcelona on the metro. It is the last but one stop and takes quite a long time to la ramblas. 

The drinks and food were ridiculously overpriced. In the centre of Barcelona in a four star hotel ( which was higher quality) we only paid 5 euros for two coffees. They were 4 each here. Breakfast was 28 euros each. So we visited a little coffee shop across the road and got pastries and coffee. 

We had to be at the airport early but to get the shuttle we had tk arrive outside over half an hour before it's departure to guarantee a seat as it only seats 8 and only dies one run at that time. We found that quite stressful. 

Apart from the view and the comfortable bed we felt the hotel had little else to offer and was a huge disappointment. Chatting to others on the plane home it seems other hotels much closer to the airport offer a better deal. 
",3,2015,07,28
30,Good hotel and excellent breakfast,"This was a good brief stay for 2 days. Good spacious rooms, clean, good breakfast and the surrounding village can be a good outing by itself.

If you want away from city traffic and noise, this is a good option.

Downside: they charged us extra- almost half of the room price to take in a 10 yr child as only one child is allowed free. Though it was a double room, the price was steep finally.

No spa visit included

Pool not open to children!

But for the price and quality, I can still recommend.

",4,2015,07,27
30,Great hotel. Location not so great,"after missing the free 8 person capacity shuttle bus we attempted to get a train or bus. Unfortunately failed as no signs or directions in English and staff not speaking English at train station. We got a taxi... AVOID this as the hotel is 5-10 mins away and taxi from airport is 25 euro min charge. Do your homework there's a direct bus from the airport which stops outside the hotel. Buy a 10 ticket travel card. You can use this on train,metro,bus and costs just under 10 euro. On arriving at the hotel, reception was overstaffed and checking was efficient, never had to wait at desk to be served always lots of staff. Room was very nice indeed and has shower gel,shampoo,soap,hand cream,shoe shine, which are all replenished daily. There is a very overpriced mini bar get small can of Pringles 7euro. The petrol garage has a good selection of snacks and alcohol. The guys there very friendly and speak the best English I found in Barcelona. There's no kettle in the room this is charged at 12 euro if u need it,and costs 5 euro for a refill which is very poor 2 English breakfast teabags 2 coffee,2 earl grey,4 small biscuits a bottle of water. use garage for tea bags coffee sugar and water if you hire the kettle. Drinks at bar and cafe overpriced and noting in the area. 
Biggest let down was spa, swimming pool and gym all which 'looked' included in the booking. This is in a separate building and is charged daily at 14 euro. You need swimming cap and flip flops again they charge you if you don't have these. Gym is very busy on an evening so best to use early in the day. 
The metro station is a 2 min walk across the university car park. I never had any issue with safety and always other people about with security with guard dogs at station. One day I did witness someone being detained on the floor, so shows security is good.
Barcelona is 38 mins away in metro which is well air conditioned. You can get off at arc de triumph to connect with a h16 bus to the beach. Total 48 mins from hotel. We did one day wait for the hotel shuttle which carries 8 people but found it squeezes in 10 in an uncomfortable journey, stuck in traffic into the city. Best to get the metro. The one thing that was free is the wifi. Only TV channel in English is bbc news. The condition of the bedrooms is very good, only downfall was mould across ceiling in the most amazing bathroom with power jet shower.",3,2015,07,25
30,"Fantastic accommodation and facilities, but nothing else.","The accommodation is excellent, and the staff try very hard.

Nothing else in the area.  No restaurants worthy of use, no shopping.

The hotel restaurant quality and hours needs a major upgrade if they wish to remain 5 star, even 4 star.",4,2015,07,22
30,Enjoy,"Just got back from a three night stay, lovely hotel in a not so lovely area. Only a couple of minutes from the metro station which we used a lot over the time we were there and a lot cheaper than taxis. 21 euros for a 3 day pass. The hotel shuttle only goes to terminal 1 and we arrived at terminal 2. We just jumped on the number 46 bus for a couple of euros and its only a short journey to the hotel(bus stops a two minute walk from hotel). Check in was quick and easy.  Room was on 16th floor with great views.  Room was spacious and comfortable, mini bar quite expensive so didn't use. There is a charge to hire a kettle and be provided tea, coffee etc... Really in a 5 star hotel... Could this not be provided free of charge in  a 5 star hotel??  Would expect to be charged in a cheap hotel but not here!!! Didn't use pool etc as again there is a fee of  14 euros each, again a hotel of this standard and location should provide amenities such as this for its guests.  The bathroom and shower were amazing...great toiletries were provided and restocked daily... The rain shower was fantastic, you could change the setting and get 6 massage jets instead.. Could have spent longer in here if we weren't fitting so much into our days. Be aware this hotel is last tube stop on L1 so takes about 30 minutes to get into the centre of Barcelona and it's hot down there too!!! (cheaper than taxis). Would definitely recommend this hotel... Just do your homework  and plan before you go!  Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did!!

30,business tower,"nice,modern rooms,spacious bathrooms,close to the airport - but far from city-center (taxis available in front of the hotel round the clock),free wifi,good breakfast,helpful front-desk,only complaint:no laundry at weekends.",4,2015,07,20
30,Good hotel with nice view,"I really enjoyed my stay here. Easy access to city, big and comfortable. Room size was descent and modern fixtures. Only downside is the cost, there are hidden charges and overpriced mini bar items. Another thing I was disappointed about was when checking out, I requested if I could get some water, the front desk person said "" oh sorry kitchen is closed"" rather than being resourceful and assist a guest who is thirsty. ",3,2015,07,19
30,good hotel a bit far though,It is a bit far from the center of barcelona and the main attractions ... about 30mins by the subway. The hotel offers  a shuttle bus but we had to find out about it ourselves and generaly we weren`t told about the services of the hotel. the rooms are big enough clean and modern,4,2015,07,16
30,Excellent Hotel in Barcelona,"The staff was very helpful and friendly. My friend and I were checked in quickly, and they gave us great recommendations for places to eat and see. The room was really clean and modern, and they even gave me a birthday cake. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,07,15
30,Good Hotel but away from centre,"Great hotel with rooms of ultra modern design and bathrooms are truly amazing. Not impressed that it cost 14 euros for the pool and spa. Should be free in a 5 star hotel. Not told about about the facilities on check-in. Information pack in room should be more comprehensive regards hotel services etc.
Shuttle bus should have more seats for a hotel so far from the city centre.",5,2015,07,14
30,Stay away from the money seeker,"We stayed here for 2 nights, we already paid city tax which is about 20 euros for 4 people when we check in. They asked us madly to pay the city tax again when we check out, my taxi was waiting outside, so i paid city tax again for nothing! They show us a board that I don't have time to read through it, well. Apart from the ridiculous robbery, this hotel has no restaurant opened in weekend days, the room is ok since we booked it during flash sale, but if we visit barcelona again, we won't live here again.",1,2015,07,14
30,Nice place,Great hotel with nice restaurants and great room which are very comfortable staff are friendly room service is great this hotel does not have pool and gym included it is not included to reservation which is Not good and they say they have shuttle but it is very limited so do not expected to be served with shuttle but it is cross the metro station which you can use to go anywhere in Barcelona ,5,2015,07,10
30,Luxury hotel in the wilderness,"There are many good things about this hotel - the friendly staff, large rooms with huge bed, lovely bathroom and decent quality products. We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the food although there is a very expensive restaurant at the top with fantastic views.  I think it even revolves, it looks a bit like a spaceship.

We used the pool/spa facilities which I found expensive at 14,00 euros per person for guests. You also need a swimming cap and flip flops which you can buy for 2.50 but lending for free would be a nice touch did a 5star hotel.  The entry includes use of the spacious gym facilities as well. This is a sports complex which is open to members not just hotel guests.

The downside is the neighborhood. Not only is there nothing within walking distance, the one bar we found felt quite threatening and we witnessed some kind of fracas with drunk or drugged people shouting and fighting, really shocking. There is a metro stop nearby but if for any reason you hadn't planned to go into Barcelona the area is sadly very lacking.",4,2015,07,08
30,Perfect for Us and at a Great Value,"I chose this resort based on a great price (deal), convenience to airport for early morning flight to London and Trip Advisor reviews/traveler photos.  We had stayed in Barcelona previously and on this one month European trip stayed 3 nights pre-cruise in the Les Corts area of Barcelona.

Do your homework and you will be very pleased.  We are very aware of the strict 3pm check in rule in many countries. Be prepared and book a night before your early flight arrival, or out smart the jet lag and hit the ground running.  The hotel will safely store your luggage for you while you begin your explorations of the city.

The metro is as close as possible - right across the street.  5 minutes tops, unless you're using a walker.  It is  the last stop of the line, but a direct route to Placa Catalunya, where you can walk Las Ramblas.  Buy a T10 ticket and away you go.  On this trip, however we did want to check in right after our cruise as my husband was very ill and I wanted to get him in a room to lay down.  Courtesy and a tip go a long way.  That's all I'm saying. Maybe pleading and a tip.  It's a huge hotel- they have to have at least one room ready.

We were given an excellent room with no issues.  The front desk person I dealt with did seem rather curt, but the bellman was so kind and helpful.  He was the one who told me that if I took my ice bucket to the bar I would get ice for free, after asking two housekeepers who told me I had to call room service.  It's a 5 Euro charge through room service.  

We did not really get to explore the hotel as we were only there one night so we probably paid more just for comfort.  It was a very comfortable room with good linens and amenities.  The bathroom is luxurious and a sure sign that this was indeed a five star hotel at one time.  Robes, slippers, closets and drawers for a very high end clientele.  Possibly the location has caused them to slide in capacity and therefore rates have been reduced and when that happens, other amenities slide.  We got an excellent night's sleep and loved what we saw of the hotel.

While in a somewhat remote area, I shopped for food after I got back from a day in the city behind the hotel.  There is a grocery store, bakery, bar, outside cafes, and since it out of the city the prices were very reasonable.  We checked out at 5:00 am to a much friendlier desk clerk and the taxis were up on the hill.  We waved for one and I have to say that we didn't really save money on a taxi staying this far from the main strip area, but we saved time.  Plus the cab driver was more thrilled with the unused portion of the  metro ticket I gave him over the tip.  Glad we got to the airport early and that I had pre-printed my boarding passes, as the wait time looked horrendous.  It was packed.  If we had to wait in that line we would have missed our 6:30 am flight.

If I had wanted to swim and had to pay, I would not be happy. Other than the lobby, the elevator, halls,  our room and a quick trip to the bar for ice, we didn't see any other part of the hotel.  The hotel does give off a luxurious feel, we just didn't use the facilities.  Also, our room was extremely quiet.  If it's your first trip to Barcelona and you will be here awhile, yes, you want to be closer to the action.  This is a business/convention hotel and therefore great prices.  We always stay in business over boutique hotels for two main reasons - comfort and price.

A downside - they have free wifi but will only SELL you an adapter.  Every hotel I've been in will lend you one and charge you if you don't return it. That's bad service.

Other than the Bellman, service is average to good, not ""Very Good"".",4,2015,07,04
30,Wedding,We had the pleasure as a large family to stay in the Hesperia tower hotel for our Sons wedding in may. From the outside this hotel didn't look like a hotel but once through the main door it takes on a very different look. The reception area and bar is very spacious with lovely decoration and tables and chairs laid out beautifully. We then proceeded to the rooms. These were absolutely great we couldn't in any way fault them .lovely big dressing room and storage with wash hand basin and vanity unit with separate wc and shower facilities. As our stay was for a wedding there we got a great deal  . the only drawback was the price of the drink but this was up to the individual whether or not one wanted to pay.  The wedding reception was great with attention to detail by the wedding co.ordinator. i t was a fabulous evening till the early hours of the morning. Whilst this hotel is only short drive from airport it is however out of the city. But a taxi only took 15 mns n cost 12-15 e depending on time of day. There was also the bus and metro from outside the hotel. There was also a little square 5 mns away with supermarket n lovely bakery so handy for bits n pieces. We found the restaurants in the hotel to be on a par with those of same standard elsewhere. We would certainly stay there again as we feel the extra we would pay would be worth it . there was also a lovely swimming pool etc for bit of leisurely time. We would recommend tg his hotel to anyone .,5,2015,06,30
30,No pool !! Far from city center,"I stayed with my son for 6 nights.
The biggest deception we had 2 minutes after check-in ! I found out that the hotel has no pool !!! Although we saw plenty of pictures before we booked ! 
They only have a deal with a gym Spa in the same building but access is only from 16 years old , so we need to wait only around 10 years ... As he's not old enough.
The worst was when I asked reception if we could use the pool of a sister hotel... They said no but that there was a Public swimming pool at 10 minutes walking ... Excuse me , I book a 5 star hotel , and got this arrogant answer !!
Further more , the hotel is very far from the city center, it is located outside Barcelona ( not even called Barcelona anymore !) this a good business hotel but forget it as a family hotel or if you plan visiting Barcelona
Nice Breakfast and rooms however",3,2015,06,30
30,I expected more of this 5-star,"The hotel has a fancy design. It's located some 30 min by metro from downtown. Metro station is 10 min walk from the hotel. 
Rooms are very good, however amenities just basic.
I found front desk service not friendly nor helpful but respectful.
We had a room on the 11th floor, with views to the city. I must admit it was great.
Hotel is fine, perhaps a bit expensive for what it is (150 ‚Ç¨/night)",2,2015,06,28
30,pleasant stay,"I enjoyed my stay in the hotel. 
It took a bit time finding the bathroom light switches as they where not located near the main door and the bathroom was very dark and covered with mirrors. Eventually it did not bother me after.
During checking out the service was a bit overloaded and they had problem with printing the invoice.
Overall a pleasant stay. I would visit it again.",4,2015,06,25
30,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,"spent 1 night in this hotel, great service at the reception, friendly staff & our room was located on the 15th floor definitely worth the money paid for it, as we got it on a ""secret hotel"" absolutely blown away by the room, would recommend this hotel to people. ",5,2015,06,22
30,Brilliant servie if you stay longer,"I have been staying in suite room for over 5 days. As you probably could imagine, staffs service in overall. Room service is delicious ,especially paella (pa eh ya).
Felipe served me most of the time. Find him if you are going to stay long.",4,2015,06,20
30,Amazing hotel and experience in Barcelona,"Amazing hotel! Spectacular views. Our room was on the 23rd floor so had wonderful views of Barcelona, overlooked the airport however there was no problem with noise ( great videos of airplanes taking off and the sunset!) The bathroom was wonderful with a really powerful shower. Free toiletries were replaced daily, and every time we came back to the hotel the toilet roll end was folded ^_^ . restaurants were expensive, but again lovely! The top floor restaurant was closed so did get to go there.
This was just a room however... I was quite disappointed that although the Expedia listing mentioned the pool etc, this was an EXTRA ¬£14 per person per day... ( don't think I know of a pool that is worth that? ) At the same time, the sea was wonderful to swim in. 
With regard to transport, the free hotel shuttle does exist, just only turns up ever hour or so to the airport departures rather than arrivals ( parking G ) which was quite confusing. The number 42 bus is more regular and only like 2 euros so preferable. From the hotel to the center of Barcelona, again the hotel shuttle is okay, but the red line metro is more regular.

All in all a great hotel! Very pleased to have stayed there, hope this review helped you.",5,2015,06,20
30,Did not want to go home!,"What an amazing time it was! Don't know where to begin. We'd booked a standard double room, upon arrival, the receptionist gave us an offer for one of the junior suites. After seeing the photos of the room, we couldn't say no. There was a jacuzzi next to the bed & a monsoon shower room. The hotel is close to the airport & a short trip on the metro to get into the city centre. Would love to come back!",5,2015,06,13
30,Location near the airport,"This 5 star property is a good hotel. The exterior does not look appealing at all. Rooms are nice with the NH Hotels bathrooms. Seems dark but is really nice. 

Large rooms with good beds a bit on the firm side, to my liking. 

Breakfast is great, like in most Spanish hotels. Conference facilities top notch. But - then we come to location. There is absolutely nothing of interest around the hotel. City centre is 20-30 minutes away by taxi. 

Nice hotel, but too far away from everything. ",3,2015,06,10
30,Good business hotel between airport and city,"I stayed in this hotel 4 nights for business and that is what the hotel is mainly made for. They have numerous meeting rooms catering for up to 400 people. Meeting facilities are excellent, but pricy.The catering and breakfast was of the expected 5 star quality, so was the staff being friendly and attentive.  
The room was designed somewhat unusual entering through a bathroom / closet combination into the bedroom. It is furnished in a contemporary style and spacy. The room service worked very well, the room was clean by 12:00h each day.  
A taxi ride to Barcelona center is around 15 Euros - between 15 and 25 minutes depending on traffic. 
There is not much to do or to see around the hotel, so for a sightseeing trip to Barcelona be aware that you always need transport.   
Overall the relaxed and professional atmosphere has contributed to a good business meeting of 250 people and the well sized room has helped me to relax before and after the meeting. Not sure about the WIFI - it came included in my package but I saw a sign they charge a daily fee for it - make sure you check.",4,2015,06,09
30,"Nice stay, but not 5*","*** The Good ***
This place has nice spacious rooms, with beautiful bathrooms as you would expect in a 5* hotel. The view from most rooms I would say will be nice since this is a tower hotel, and the staff came across friendly in the interactions we had. 

*** The Bad ***
The main point to understand before you book this hotel is that it is nowhere near the city centre. They provide only a couple of shuttles a day, but if you miss that (or 8 people have come before you) then you will be paying a good 18 Euro to get a Taxi into the city centre (la rambla). We ended up paying 80 Euros in taxis because of the location of this hotel, so you should factor that into your decision when booking. 
This hotel does not quite cut it as a 5*, other than the glamorous lobby. They will charge you for everything, and most rooms do not even have a kettle. Even in the duplex suite, they only provided tea and water on the first night and charged 20 euro for any extra days. These are basics you would expect from a 3* in a UK hotel. It was not worth paying extra for the duplex suite as there was hardly any difference, and the internal stairs in the room were somewhat unsafe with sharp edges. 

*** Conclusion ***
Nice hotel, but overall I would not be staying here again. You can get hotels of a similar price and standard, right in the city centre, so I would give this hotel 4 stars.",4,2015,06,05
30,Everything was a rip off!,"Firstly this is not a leisure hotel they should not be advertising as a leisure hotel, you cannot sunbath anywhere there is no balconies in your rooms and if you want to swim in there pool it's 15‚Ç¨ every single time. Everything comes with a cost even the milk you get two tiny single shot milk cartons on your arrival if you want more you pay 12‚Ç¨ and get a futher two tiny pots this is a joke ,So we walked every night to the local garage to get tea coffee and milk so they couldn't take our money and it's saved us a fortune I have ever seen this policy in any hotel and I have stayed in 5* hotels all over the world! On the TV they put on adverts on how all the staff want to make ur stay amazing when really all they want to do is rip u off!! We was in the luxury pent house and this is how we was treated dread to think what services you would get if we stayed in the standard rooms you would probably have to pay for toilet roll.",2,2015,06,01
30,Beautiful hotel and 10 minutes to airport,"This is a wonderful hotel. Big rooms.  Only a 10 minute taxi ride to airport.  Didn't seem to have many restaurants in area so we ate at the hotel.  We were leaving the next morning so it was a quick stay.
Breakfast is over priced.  A single coffee isn't available unless you pay for the full breakfast.  That was the only issue with the hotel.",5,2015,05,28
30,Amazing Birthday Weekend,"I honestly discarded this hotel from ebookers.com because of the distance from downtown that it was/is... then my husband and I decided to book one of those secret hotels from lastminute.com and boy oh boy... to our suprise this was the hotel!

Not only was I wrong, by judging this hotel by its appearance and distance and now I  would like to say that I truly deeply love this place. 

I‚Äôm in the office so can‚Äôt do a lot of writing today but here is what I think:

Location: a bit far from downtown and the touristic places of interest, but the metro station is quite close by (Hospital Bellvitge)  directions: leave the hotel, turn right, cross the street after the roundabout and walk through the carpark and there it is! Journey takes 20-30 min and if you buy a 10 journey ticket (9.90 euros) it should last you a whole week (unless you don‚Äôt like walking) we didn‚Äôt use the hotel shuttle because we like to leave and come back when we please and they have set times for the shuttle service. 

taxi from aiport (on a saturday morning) 21 euros
taxi from hotel to aiport (on a tuesday morning) 18 euros

Food:  I have mixed feelings about this. Breakfast was 22 euros per person per day which is a bit pricey for breakfast really, but the food was amazing, lots of different choices and all you can eat, so if you eat well you could spend the whole day almost without eating LOL ‚Äì We had dinner in the formal restaurant and I left feeling very disappointed.  We paid  85 euros + 10 tip for two people and two course meals each + a glass of wine and water. it was a bit steep for what we received.

 I had Ceviche as a started and it was delicious (highly recommend) and then had paella (meat and seafood) the meat was mainly bones and the seafood was not that great either, big portion but mainly rice. My husband is a vegetarian and there weren‚Äôt many options for him (bless him) I let the hotel people know that their many has several seafood dishes marked as VEGETARIAN and that is obviously not. He had mozzarella cheese and salad which he absolutely loved and then had roasted vegetables (these weren‚Äôt any better than what we have at home if I am honest)  so if you ask me, have breakfast there but not dinner (especially if you are a vegetarian)

Rooms: absolute perfection! You walk in a big bathroom hall which everything you need (more mirrors than you can ever imagine) an amazing closet, amazing rain shower with massage jets, amazing toiletries, towels, slippers, dressing gowns‚Ä¶ yes, All IS AMAZING! The room is spacious stylish and nicely done, the sofa in there is a great relaxing add on and the mini bar is well stocked. Wifi is complimentary and it‚Äôs stable and speedy. 

 Service: amazing too. I give 100 out of 10! Excellent service and impressive language skills. This hotel should feel very proud with the workforce they have. 

Bonus: On my birthday (May 18th) we left the hotel right after breakfast and came back around 20:00, walked in to our AC cooled room only to find a lovely birthday cake, a card, a bottle of water and two glasses. The card was sent by the customer services manager Frank wishing me a very happy day and thanking me for choosing their hotel to spend my special day. That was amazing and it made my day! Thank you thank you thank you!

Had a wonderful time at this hotel and it exceeded all my expectations. 

Highly recommended. 

Happy travelling!",5,2015,05,28
30,FANCEY PANTS HOTEL,"we had a great time staying at this hotel. the only thing that could have improved it was the location of the metro. during the day it was perfectly fine,however in the evening it was a little shaky. it is at the end of the line and is about a two block walk,not far but just a little nerve racking.the staff  were more than helpful. they say that this is the hotel where the footballers all stay when in town.",4,2015,05,27
30,"Great hotel, great rooms, well linked","Nothing more to say on this really.

Rooms are really clean, shower was great and the staff were really helpful. Free pickup from Airport to hotel and again, there was a bus into City itself.

If you can't wait for the bus, you are a 3 minute walk to the Metro over the road which doesn't take long to get into the Centre.

Been twice now and would stay again.",5,2015,05,27
30,Great stay for a business trip,"The room was well appointed and extremely quiet despite being adjacent to a major road.  The finishes in the bathroom area were very nice!
The bar service was good.
The morning breakfast was great too!
      ",5,2015,05,27
30,Great place and service!,"The hotel itself is stunning with glass elevators, floors and lobby decoration. The suite was very large and included a spa bath and walk in shower together with a good sized walk around closet area. The second WC was a great touch too. Good floor to ceiling windows and views overlooking the dual carriageway and beyond. Didn't have a window to open but being 16 floors not a bad thing! Could benefit from the ability to let some fresh air in though. The suit had a lounge area with a TV and the good views again. Some of the chairs had stains on them but overall quite clean. 

We ate at the restaurant for an evening meal a couple of times. They offered dishes that are not on a usual menu but adventurous and really good. The staff in the restaurant we really attentive and provided excellent customer service but as we were practically the only diners it felt a little over the top at times to me. 

The hotel offered a shuttle bus into town and back again at certain times throughout the day. At our time of year visiting it was only a seven seater and they leave people behind on a kind of first come first serve basis. Not great for a five star hotel with hundreds of rooms. We ended up taking taxi's at around ‚Ç¨12-15 per one way trip to the centre of Barcelona. There's a small taxi rank outside the hotel and always a car there though. 

On the plus side there's a good gym to use with an indoor swimming pool.

Next time we'd probably stay a little more central but otherwise and especially for the price we paid for this hotel it's a great choice! 

Although the windows and view are good you can hear the traffic even on the sixteenth floor. It's not that bad but you'd expect pure silence as the windows don't open.  There's nothing around the hotel and you have to make a trip into the centre but if you are visiting on a conference it's great. This hotel would be one of the best in Barcelona if it were in the central part of the city but as space is a premium and mostly terraced I can see why the chose their location. 

Grand hotel, great staff and facilities but just a little away from the centre. Would book again though as the suit was a really good size!",4,2015,05,26
30,Beautiful Hotel,"Loved staying at this hotel with my husband. great location, we got the train into Barcelona most days.
Rooms are really big & the bathrooms are to die for! would really recommend a stay here!
Staff were also really helpful when needed.",5,2015,05,26
30,Perfect venue for a Congress,"At the hotel everybody was so helpful. Our congress was successful and one of the main reasons was because they helped us a lot. Meeting rooms were really good, food was really nice, and service of course. 100% recommended.",5,2015,05,25
30,Luxury Hotel at good affordable prices!,"I have to say that this Hotel is located far from the main city attractions.. close to the metro train and with a bus stop right in front of the main entrance.. the Hotel is Nice with a very modern contemporary decoration their rooms are spacious and well decorated with nice beds and granite tiles in the bathroom and showers! beautiful! it is located in the neighborhood of Hospitalet de Llobregat  a middle/working class neighborhood I could say quiet and safe area.. what I really like about the location of the Hotel is that gave me the opportunity to mingle with people from the area.. very nice people with a few cafes and bars around the area.. I enjoyed breakfast in an small market located just behind the hotel area.. cheap and delicious and ""La Flama"" Restaurant good for a beer and some small dishes their papas bravas and chorizos were great!!. The price for booking the room at the Tower Hesperia was really good around 100 USD I definitively recommend this hotel.. its far from the Ramblas and the rest of attractions but really worth to stay and to take the public transportation",4,2015,05,21
30,Review of recent short break,"Had a lovely stay at Hesperia Hotel in Barcelona.  Reception staff James and Thomas (I think) were particularly nice and helpful and we were able to check in around 11am which was great with no other charge. They also went into great detailing explaining the Metro and Sightseeing to us, the extra service provided here was excellent.  Room beautiful and bathroom stunning.  Decided to have Breakfast and found the food on offer lovely although a little steep in price.  Used the bar in evening, first two nights bar tender was a little bit miserable and drinks are quite steep even for a 5 star hotel.  Used the free bus which was good but limited on seats but found the Metro to be quick, cheap and really easy to use.  First time in Barcelona and will go again, loved sightseeing especially old Barcelona rather than new and ate at many lovely restaurants and relatively good price.",5,2015,05,21
30,Leisure use extra,"A nice hotel, but was greeted by a horrible smell outside the hotel, also booked this hotel as advised there was a pool, spa and gym, was very disappointed that this was extra and not mentioned until we arrived at the hotel, hotel is at end of metro line and easy to find, not much walking but takes about 25 mins to city centre by metro. Hotel also does courtesy bus to Playa De Catalunya but only 8 seats, so have to be there early to ensure a seat, trip takes about 20 minutes.

Bathroom great size, nice view of Barcelona",3,2015,05,19
30,AMAZING!,"I've just got back from Barcelona this afternoon after staying in the Hesperia Tower and I can't get over how amazing the hotel was. I've never written a review before as I'm not the sort of person who normally does but this hotel went beyond all expectations I just had to write as soon as possible. We went for a two night stay for my boyfriends birthday on Wednesday. Firstly our flight landed in the morning and we assumed that as check in wasn't till 3/3.30pm that we would have our bags in a locked room until then as we arrived at 10am and in our minds this wasn't a problem as this has happened in other hotels many times before and we was very aware how early we were. However we were greated by such a friendly member of staff at reception who sorted us out an early check in free of charge. I wish I could remember his name because he was such a credit to the hotel company. As it was my boyfriends birthday he sorted us out a lovely room on floor 19 with a fantastic view (which we just looked out for ages at a time it was perfect) which was more than we could have asked for. On the first day the hotel had a birthday cake and message delivered to our room with a candle and a complimentary bottle of water which was so lovely and the cake was heaven! I wish I knew where to get more from! I just thought that small detail was such a nice touch which went very far with us. Every single detail about the hotel we LOVED! The design was amazing. The designs of the room also amazing. The shower was somewhere I could have been for hours it was lovely. We had two sinks and the king sized bed was more than massive. Even the little details like the lifts to the hotel floor etc were spot on. We really couldn't have asked for more. I was unsure before we arrived about the location but I even found this perfect. It was a two minute walk if that to the metro and that took us everywhere using the T-10 which again is amazing. I could not fault this holiday and hotel once! I've recommended it already and my parents are in the process of looking to book as I've sung it's praises so high. We didn't pay for breakfast beforehand however on the last day as we had spare euros we paid the extra 22 euros each for breakfast. This was lovely.  Buffet of everything you could ever want. Full English hot food, toast, cereal, fruit, any type of juice, tea, coffee even champagne and croissants! If there was any doubt in your mind to stay here let me tell you I could talk for hours of how much i loved this hotel as I'm sure you caI've just got back from Barcelona this afternoon after staying in the Hesperia Tower and I can't get over how amazing the hotel was.

30,Great hotel,"Stayed at the hotel in a weekend. Very nice hotel with amazing friendly staff. Especially at the Front Office they were flexible and friendly. The view over the city from the room is really nice..
I would definately recommend this hotel!",5,2015,05,13
30,Beautifully Designed!,"Lovely hotel for first visit in Barcelona. Provide free shuttles to airport and also to city, although you have to line up early to guarantee a space on bus.

Little far out from city however plenty of transport options. Much cheaper than having a city centre hotel.

Very friendly staff and food/bar is great.",5,2015,05,12
30,first time to Barcelona,"Great room and Hotel.  The staff were fantastic and attentive to our every need.  The room was spotless and ultra modern.  This would definitely be a 5 star review if the location were better.  It is just a short walk to the metro station, but the neighborhood appeared to be a little run down.  We never had any problems walking to the train station, but always kept one eye over our shoulder.  If traveling to Barcelona again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again but would probably select a hotel closer to downtown.",4,2015,05,11
30,Contemporary hotel close to airport,"This is our second stay in this hotel within the last five years. Although the hotel is very nice we noticed wear and tear that goes with use especially in our room.  But, overall, the conditions were very much above average.  We appreciated the fact that we were provided a spacious room on a higher floor to take advantage of the gorgeous views of Barcelona.  The bathroom is well appointed with a magnificent walk-in shower that has lots of spray options.  First class.  The lounge area on the main floor provides very generous sized cocktails along with an assortment of nuts/munchies.  Thank you. Our dinner was absolutely the best. Paella for two with prawns, mussels, clams, etc. and the good rice...not the thin rice.  Edwin, our waiter, was so friendly and attentive.  Thanks Edwin for your wonderful service.  They do have a free airport shuttle service but it only runs every 40-45 minutes.  Otherwise it's a $20+ cab fare.",4,2015,05,11
30,Great Room and Hotel... not far from the action by Metro,"Though not exactly well located compared to those options in Barcelonetta, Downtown, or by the beaches near the Olympic port (or anywhere else near the action), this hotel has everything you need and is a top notch option. The rooms are extremely nice and well designed and the views are great!

This is my second time in the hotel and my recommendation has the following other advantages added to it:

- Excellent breakfast, though not cheap.
- Free to/from transportation (shuttle) to the airport and to Catalunya Plaza (downtown) at certain hours, saving you some money, specially with the airport cabs.
- Nice room ammenities and bathroom

I'd say the only issue is that it's about 14 stations from the main attractions, but only a 20-25 minute ride. In my case, I think it's actually a plus, since most of the other ones near these attractions, tend to be a little noisy and I don't mind commuting, even more with the excellent BCN transportation system.",5,2015,05,06
30,Top Notch. Loved it,"We stopped here on a stag party, the hotel is fantastic, great staff and great accommodation all round. The breakfast was a touch expensive at 20 euros, either way it was good. We were in Barcelona for the F1GP the circuit was a taxi ride away or a simple train ride to Montmel√≥ where the circuit is. It was also close to the city centre and the marina, all being a short taxi ride away.

All in all a great upper class hotel in a great location.",5,2015,05,04
30,hotel with a unique room design,"The first thing you will notice entering the room is the unique design. Right behind the door is not the bedroom, nor a corridor but a big bathroom! I travel a lot and I have to admit that this is the first time I come across something similar. The space is big as in the bathroom they also have the closet and by having only a (very nice) shower they managed to provide enough space to move around.
The bedroom is equally nice but not as big as the bathroom area, with a sofa and a nice desk and great view. The only thing I didn't found is the typical kits (dental, saving etc) that you normally find in 5 star hotels.
Breakfast was also nice with big variety of food. As I was there for a conference I also enjoyed a nice dinner with very interesting tastes.",4,2015,05,03
30,"nice room, comfortable bed, but ugly outside.. bad location","we were in hesperia tower for 3 days in March. the bedroom is quite nice, contemporary designed and have big bathroom & very comfortable bed. full amenities available in the room. 

when booking we were told that our room package include the pool & fitness access, but was told that if we want to use the pool & fitness we will have to pay extra when check in... disappointed. 

the location of this hotel is like other reviewer mentioned, it is in the middle of no where. last stop of metro and about 5 min walk from the station. its very easy recognisable once when exit from the station because there is nothing around the area besides some apartments , a hospital complex and a media markt. the hotel is the highest building among everything there. during the day hotel offer free shuttle service to/from the city centre, but not so frequent.  roughly about 15-20 min ride to the city.  

its a good place to stay if you don't mind the travelling, good value for the quality of the room.",4,2015,04,30
30,Extremely disappointed,"We attended a conference at this hotel in the last 3 days, and have to say it has been one of the worst hotel experiences we have had.

1. Service was non existing. In the meeting room the waiters were plainly rude and impersonal, which is unacceptable for a 5-star hotel. The barmanager was so upset that he had to serve customers, that he simply ignored them and willed them to go away. When you did get service, he took the money, but did not actually register it on the cash register, nor was a receipt provided.

2. The location of the hotel is close to the airport in a low-end residential area without any dining options.Therefore you are forced to eat and drink at the hotel. Unfortunately the quality of the food and drinks selection is of a 3 star level, leaving me hungry for most of my time in the hotel.

3. Wifi in the meeting room areas was poor throughout.

Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2015,04,30
30,Amazing Wedding Anniversary,"Did a lastminute secret hotel and this beauty came up. Didn't know what to expect at first as the reviews were mixed, but we turned up early (9.30am) and the staff were great and friendly. We were offered an upgrade to one of the suites and we grabbed it with both hands.
The suite was insane, downstairs was very spacious (didn't really use it much apart from eating food) floor to ceiling windows looking out to the city. Upstairs was perfect. MAHOOOOOSIVE bed, I could sprawl out and the wife wouldn't be annoyed :-D The bathroom was really clean and the layout was really well though out. To top it off, there was a Jacuzzi next to the bed, looking out to Barcelona. I don't think I've bathed so much in 4 days haha
The shuttle bus that runs in the mornings/afternoon took us straight into the heart of Barcelona and to the airport, although there is also a metro right across the hotel and a for a few euros you can get a ticket into the city
I couldn't have asked for a better experience and a play to stay in Barcelona. Hats off to the staff.

Only down point is the room service wasn't that great and very expensive.",5,2015,04,28
30,Wonderful!,Stayed here for 4 nights in Oct 2013! The hotel and staff is absolutely wonderful. Rooms are huge with a big closet that makes every woman happy :) The buffet breakfast was one of the best we have had in Europe. Not located in the heart of Barcelona but a very easy metro journey makes this a perfect Barcelona stay.  ,5,2015,04,27
30,Nice hotel,Nice hotel best clean lines. Close to airport which I prefer instead of close to centre as I don't need to rush  when I travel. If you want best experience look for higher rooms. The reason why I have given 4* I think if you get a lower floor rooms maybe the views aren't great.,4,2015,04,24
30,Brilliant hotel,We stayed there for a long weekend and were greeted right from the start with great service. Hotel restaurant was fantastic. Best meal I have ever had. Room service was precise and very well presented and they even left a birthday cake in our room with a birthday wish after seeing cards on the side. We did not make them aware ourselves. Highly recommended. ,5,2015,04,20
30,Excellent stay!,"I stayed at Hesperia during a recent 3-day holiday in Barcelona. I found the Hotel to be very modern and well maintained, the rooms impressive, and the staff friendly and very helpful. They arranged an early check in for us on the day we arrived, and even left a cake and congratulatory note in my room on my birthday. The free shuttle service is very convenient, and the metro station is very close. All in all an enjoyable stay. Would recommend.",5,2015,04,15
30,"Wow!  Unexpected amenities, great looking hotel and rooms. Easy to get from airport. Great value.","I decided for this hotel as it was the only available close to Fira Convention Center.  I am very pelased with my stay so far.  The hotel is  between the airport and the city center.  I took bus 46 to get here (a 20 min ride).  The Hesperia is easy to spot as it is a single tower in the middles of smaller buildings.  It has a modern look on the outside.  Crossing the busy avenue is not a problem as there is a tunnel under it.  They had my room ready by 11 as I requested via the website.  The room has a modern feel w dark furniture and lots of glasses,  flat screen TV, a book shelf w city information, a stocked fridge, remote controlled curtains, rain shower, horizontal spray jets in the shower, a sofa and a make up station right at the desk.  Room service was really fast.  Suggest their pumpkin and  carrot soup and their huge fruit salad.  Service was corteous.  I cant wait to try their antioxy breakfast buffet.  I cant comment on the distance to city.  This seems a hotel catered to the convention site .  It is excellent for that purpose. Also cant beat the price.  Really a great value.",5,2015,04,13
30,Nice for the price!,"I got a deal so because it was amazing, all modern hotel, but it¬¥s in the middle of know where, have a tube station just beside about 5 minutes walk but take a quite longer to get to the city centre, my next time I will find something better location.",4,2015,04,07
30,Great rooms,"Beautiful hotel, great rooms. Location is between airport and city. Bus service into the centre of Barcelona. Breakfast was great and buffet lunch was really good. Staff very friendly and helpful.....",5,2015,04,06
30,Tati,"Pros. It's beautiful, with great views, half an hour by metro to the city centre, very nice and varied breakfast.
Cons. It's more of a business hotel, quite shabby, no facilities of 5*, no coffee/tea, no glasses or cutlery in the room (only for the extra charge), furniture is scratched and chipped, bed on wheels, room is stuffy.  It stinks of sewage from the little ponds next to the entrance. Spa is closed at the weekend, to reach it u have to go through the sweaty gym floor and then to wear a proper swimmers cap for the pool. Not 5* experience at all, must be downgraded. Stayed in much better 3* and 4*",3,2015,04,05
30,"Amazing hotel, excellent and polite staff throughout","Stopped here for the recent Robbie Williams concert - short taxi ride from airport (didn't spot the minimum 20 Euro charge though). End station of Metro is 3-mins walk across the road. Rooms are spacious and very well equipped once you've found your way past all the mirrors in the bathroom (needs a mirror in the room though). Food at breakfast at 22 Euro was well worth it (book in advance at reception to save Euro). Staff were ever so helpful giving tips on where to go, and how to get there. There are a couple of free buses from/to airport too. Would love to go back there again. THANKS EVERYONE !!!",5,2015,03,31
30,Beautiful view with friendly staff,Been there in march end. Hotel is beautiful and classy with friendly staff. Rooms were very clean and had beautiful view. Its 5 mins walk to train station and 15 mins from airport. Lot of indoor facilities which are paid. Will definitely visit again,5,2015,03,30
30,Great Business Event!,We organized our yearly Product Launch at the Hesperia Tower. Facilities and services were outstanding. We received very positive feedback after the event as our guests experienced a true five-star event.,5,2015,03,30
30,Modern,"A luxury hotel in the suburb of Barcelona very close from the Bellvitge Hospital and from the south high way.
Rooms are spacious and originally organized with open bathroom 
High floor rooms offer a very nice view on both sea (fare away), ills and the east of the city.
Restaurant is very good and everything is done to make you feel relaxed . May be more light would be better but it is just my point of view... I like to see what I eat...
Frontdesk service is perfect and lift system is very modern.
",4,2015,03,25
30,Nice hotel,Nice rooms with great view over the city. Really nice  inside.  Love the view  from the lift window. Close to airport and very good for public transport. The only downdraft side is the area around is not exiting. Yes I would come back.,4,2015,03,17
30,"Overly expensive, considering location ","I recently stayed at this hotel for 1 night, alongside other hotels in the city on the same break. The room cost ¬£230 which I feel was overly expensive considering the location (very close to the airport, not so much the city), no breakfast included and anything additional such as a kettle or iron would come at an extra cost. The hotel was very clean and modern and the room was spacious and comfortable. I would not stay in this hotel again for a city break",3,2015,03,10
30,Pearl near Airport,"Had several times satisfactory overnight stay 5min from Barcelona Airport.
Hesperia Tower has all a business traveler requires: efficient staff, comfortable rooms and good quality restaurants. The view is a nice extra.

30,"Nice hotel, horrible service","The hotel is a modern tower close to the airport. There is also a metro line nearby going to downtown.  However, what use is the hotel next to the airport if you can not take advantage of an airport shuttle. Those run only up to 8pm and even then something like once an hour at odd times. When we complained at the reception,  we were told it is not their problem. Very rude and inappropriate. You can forget about taking this shuttle from the airport, you simply won't be able to find it.",3,2015,03,01
30,Amazing,this was my first time here with my boyfriend and we both loved it so much. the room was perfect and so amazing and all staff was friendly! defiantly recommend this hotel and defiantly returning! :) :),5,2015,02,25
30,Great Stay - Pure luxury ,"Gorgeous hotel, pure luxury. The rooms are large with stunning views of the city.

The reason why I haven't given it full marks is because it is a way out of the city centre, however there is a metro underground nearby and a bus shuttle service.
Another reason is because it appears to be in the middle of nowhere, there are some local flats/shops nearby but it's quite derelict.

Lovely hotel but will probably stay closer to city centre next time.",4,2015,02,20
30,No free kettle!!!!,"The hotel is nice and staff were professional. Breakfast selection was lovely, cheaper if pre-booked. The only let down was not having a kettle and complimentary tea and coffee in the room. They wanted to charge me 12‚Ç¨ for the privilege of being provided with one an a couple of sachets of coffee... Even Travelodge does this for free!",4,2015,02,19
30,Stay in Feb2014,"The hotel is very nice with excellent facilities. We used the pool and spa. The rooms are contemporary and stylish with electric blinds etc. The room we stayed in (deluxe) did lack in general maintenace slightly for example the blinds were torn from places and the ceiling leaked water quite badly after use of the jacuzzi, however the staff were very quick to accommodate us with another room. The room service is excellent but did lack slightly in options for vegetarian... Getting around wasnt too bad as a metro station was only 5 mins walk. Value for money was excellent, overall i would recommend..",4,2015,02,13
30,Nice Hotel - A Little Out of the Way,"Hotel is located on the outskirts - nothing really within walking distance.
Room was nice. Modern decor but definitely showing signs of wear. Having never traveled to Europe before, it took me a while to figure out how to turn the lights on/power within the room! (must insert room key into slot just inside door). 
Breakfast was included in the room rate, and it had a good selection of hot/cold dishes.
Hotel restaurant was very good.  Nice selection of fish, pasta, meat dishes, along with the local's favorite ham and tomato spread.
There was a mix-up with the room charges.  The room and expenses of another person travelling with me were included on my bill.  They took care of this expeditiously.",4,2015,02,11
30,Lovely Hotel,"A wonderful hotel in a wonderfulHad a wonderful stay at this hotel. Everything was spic & span. Room service, cleanliness, breakfast, ambience of the hotel.. everything was just perfect.

The staff is very courteous and are willing to help you with local info which you dont normally find on  the internet.

I'd love to go back to Barcelona again & to Hesperia",5,2015,02,03
30,great hotel,I was here for  an event but also stayed in the hotel. Some staff struggle to understand english - but doesn't everyone...on the whole they were thorough from check in to check out and during the event. The rooms are confusing as you walk in and you find your self effectively in the bathroom. Then you walk through into the bedroom with long distance views over Barcelona. It is a little way out of the center but probably only a 10min cab ride. It's also just 15 minutes in a taxi to the airport. Food is great and I just loved the rooms. For an NH - which sometimes can be hit or miss - it was 5* decor and service. On a clear day you apparently have amazing 360 degree views across Barcelona from the very top of the hotel - sadly we didn't see it as we were there in rainy early December.,4,2015,02,02
30,The best NH hotel I have stayed in so far,"Quiet a stylish hotel - very modern rooms & lobby,  Staff are helpful and nice. Good gym connected to the hotel. Convenient to airport and metro  to the city centre. Not close to the beach unfortunately

30,Business hotel with scenic view,"Don't expect a cozy hotel. This is a business hotel with well organised conference facilities. Large tower with nice views from the bar at the top, or when going up and down in the outside elevator. Clean and moderns design. Not far from the airport. The neighbourhood has very little to offer in terms of culture, sightseeing or restaurants, but it is just short ride to Barcelona center. Correct service, but the restaurants wasn't very flexible when we arrived as a group of ca 20 people. Too many they told us. Nothing to eat at the bar but we could order room service....",4,2015,01,17
30,restaurant so expensive,"Because the hotel is far from the center of barcelona, the price of the drinks and food at the restaurant is so expensive..
I have to say the rooms are stunning, but is nothing around the hotel.. so do not expect to do a lot..",3,2015,01,14
30,Defo not a five star,"Arrived 3 hours early, despite calling ahead to ask if we could have early check in we were told our room wasn't available unless we paid 50 euros. I wasn't feeling very well so ended up paying the 50 euros.

Lifts operated with a touch screen device which originally seemed cool however became quite annoying as the lifts took forever.

The room: Walk in and you were in the bathroom. Unusual. But the bathroom was amazing. Lighting was a bit dull, powerful shower with lots of jets. On arrival there was no hot water, called reception and someone came to change the shower knobs within 15 minutes.

We were on the 23rd floor and the view was AMAZING! Absolutely breath taking. The room itself was spacious with a big comfortable bed. 

Had to call house keeping a few times for some extra towels, shampoo, iron etc after waiting over twenty minutes we had to call back as they forgot and had to wait at least another twenty minutes to receive the things. 

We went to one of the restaurants in the hotel and the food was beautiful! However out of all the restaurants in the hotel there was only one open which was a bit annoying considering it was the New Years period. Ordered the creme br√ªl√©e which was stone cold (on two different occasions). The restaurant manager was kind enough to give us a complimentery desert. 

Considering it is a five star hotel i did not expect to have to pay extra to use the swimming pool.

Generally the staff weren't very friendly and I think that they could give you some more information about the local area (e.g. where the metro, supermarket is etc.) Location generally is quite good. 5 minute walk to the metro station which took about 15 mins to get to the main attractions. The T-10 metro card is great value! 10 euros for 10 uses of it. 

Lovely room. But that's it. Not a 5* at all!",3,2015,01,06
30,"Stunning rooms, super contemporary, and impressive accommodations...","My family and I stayed at this hotel for a single night, ahead of our layover trip to Ireland; After over a week cruising the Mediterranean. Before the cruise, we stayed in a FABULOUS hotel in the Gothic District, the Hotel Boria BCN. (I reviewed that hotel as soon as I returned).

As far as the Hesperia Tower is concerned, I have to say, that this hotel was simply a sight to see. Stunning architecture, sleek reception area, ultra Euro-contemporary, very, very modern in design and function. I was a bit stunned considering this hotel is tucked away in what I would consider, a somewhat industrial area.

We arrived a bit early to the hotel, and were offered a tower suite upgrade room at a reasonable price. One of the better decisions we made on our trip, was to take it...a fact we quickly realized as we  made our way up to our two story, top floor accommodations. 

These rooms, were just brilliantly decorated with dark woods, contemporary furnishings, and a view of the city from both floors..honestly....just a pleasant, pleasant surprise. Downstairs, there was a living room, modest dining table, and a bathroom...the forth wall...completely glass which ran up to the 2nd. On the upper deck,  we had a spa tub right up against the glass wall, a king bed, and an on suite bathroom and spacious shower. Again......just a great view of the city. 

Our kids had an adjoining sister room, and they were in heaven. Honestly...this 1 night stay probably spoiled them for life. The floor itself was very clean and secure. Your room key gave you access to the floor and the common eating areas in the tower. No kitchen, but we had a fridge and had I not booked the reservation myself, I might have forgotten we were in a hotel at all. This room looks a penthouse bachelor pad. Not allot of square footage, but they did ALLOT with what they gave you. 

The rest of the facilities themselves, were not open during our stay, or we didn't have a chance to visit; A shame because the pool area looks amazing. However, the restaurant was open, and we booked a dinner for the entire family. Again.......GREAT ambiance. LED lighting, glass walls, a stainless steel, 2 story whine caddy in the center of the room...and a nice view all around. This was more night club then dining center. Two floors in the restaurant, but I don't think you can go wrong sitting anywhere in that establishment. 

The food, was acceptable. Not the best we had while in Barcelona, but the service was commendable and the food itself, well plated. The front desk offers a dining option for the restaurant and a choice of two menu's. We chose the pricier one, and would do so again if we were to stay there in the future. Again, food was good...but not great; You can judge the value yourself should you have an opportunity to dine there. Worth a try, just not worth a rave review. 

So, that said, here are my quick pro's and cons concerning the hotel:

Pro's:

1) The suites we stayed in were amazing. Can't speak for the other rooms, but, if those two story accommodations offer any insight into the other rooms....well worth a stay.

2) Proximity to the bus and subway. The day we stayed, the train wasn't servicing our stop. But the bus stop was a short walk out the front of the hotel. You can see the stop right from the front of the facility. It dropped us off down the line where we caught the subway and were off to the center of Barcelona. Very easy, very convenient....great experience in that sense overall.

3) Location. This can be a pro or con depending on your travel goals. This is pretty close to the airport and their is a convenient shuttle the hotel offers its guests. Your not so close to an Airport where you FEEL like your staying near the Airport, but its close and convenient...20 minutes I think..

4) The feel of the accommodations...made the booking worth it by itself. We could have stayed in, swam, eaten dinner, explored the electronics store next door...and been satisfied with just that. I feel like we got value from what we spent, even if we didn't spend much time there. 

5) Professional staff. I wont say friendly staff...in my opinion. Simply very courteous, very professional, and well mannered. Our hosts in Dublin were the same, so...I am not sure what to expect from Europe in this regard. Our other hotel in Barcelona, we felt our hosts were very friendly...of course we had a longer stay there. Still, I respect professionals in the hospitality industry and what they do. And these folks were professional. 

Cons:

1) if your not a fan of being in one of the most historic cities in the world, and then staying in one of the most contemporary buildings ever built, in the middle of a bland and industrial like spot...then this isn't the place for you. I could see how some might even consider the hotel ""over the top"". I mean, one might step in to the place and mistake it for a techno rave.

2) Your not walking anywhere from this hotel. Your going to have to navigate public transit if you want to spend some time out in the city center. And on certain days, that will involve taking a bus, and then a short jaunt, to the first open subway terminal. Now, once your on the subway...your good to go. But....if your not comfortable doing that...this hotel isn't for you.

3) The food....again...the food wasn't bad. But, it just wasn't very memorable. For us, the experience and ambiance was better than the cuisine. The food is worth a try, just not worth a rave review. 

4) Price....this is relative, but this was a bit pricey for us and I am not sure I would have spent more than a day there had our trip demanded it. We splurged because it was only a single night and my son really wanted to try this hotel based on photos. There is definitely value to be had here, but it depends on your travel goals. 

Summing it all up, we really liked our single night stay here. But having stayed in the Gothic District just the week prior, steps away from the night life and essentially sleeping on the set of Game of Thrones, I don't think I'll stay here our next trip to Barcelona. The city is just too beautiful to spend your nights on the outskirts of the city center, and you have less pricier options with greater access to what the city has to offer. This hotel is great for business...great if you can't tolerate the hustle and bustle of the center city, and great if your a hit it and quit it, and then return back to home base sorta mentality. 

But if your in  Barcelona to immerse yourself in the culture and history, find an option closer to the city center. Even if your not a fan of the touristy city parts, find a hotel that is near a more residential area and enjoy the local lifestyle.",4,2015,01,06
30,Little gem out of the city,We stayed here in january of last year for a long weekend. The hotel is beautiful and really is quite something. We had an amazing room with a great view! The location is perfect for the airport although i would avoid taking a taxi. The driver had a sticker that said 15 euros anywhere. Although when he drove 10 mins down the road to the hotel and charged us 40 euros he said that the sticker price is for local people as english people are rich! For that we never took a taxi again. To get into the main part of Barcelona was a shortish train ride. Although we didnt feel comfortable coming back to late on the train. For the price we paid it was well worth the money. Perfect for a romantic weekend away rather than a drinking weekend away. Would go back again.,4,2015,01,04
30,Not five star but a solid four with an excellent restaurant.,We arrived a bit early and our room was not ready so we decided to go to the resturant on the second floor. Absolutely awesome meal with a great wine. The portion size is what I would expect of most restaurants in Barcelona. But the appetizers more than make up for the small size of the mains. As far as our room we were on the 14th floor in a standard room. Comfortable bed and an ample sized bathroom. We ordered room service twice as we were tired from traveling. That did not dissapoint as well. The only thing is that the hotel is a bit away from the city center but that gives you a larger room and you are closer to the airport. It like the rest of life is a give and take. But you will totally enjoy your stay at this hotel.,4,2014,12,30
30,Worth the money!,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in. Stayed here for 3 nights, over my birthday weekend.

Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a better room with a fantastic view (hotel has 25 floors, our room was on the 23rd!). Check-in was pretty fast and easy, service was great. Hotel provides shuttle to and from airport BUT better check the shuttle schedule because there is nothing between 11am to 5pm. 

Rooms are spacious and well designed. Bathroom is a luxury!! Bed was so comfortable!

Breakfast buffet is amazing - great food and with free flow champagne! 

On my birth day, the hotel surprised me with a delicious chocolate cake, with a candle to blow! Loved it!

This hotel is located pretty much far from the centre of Barcelona but they provide shuttle to and from the city. The metro is just a few minutes walk from the hotel - would take you roughly 20-30mins to the city centre. Not bad!

I'd stay here again when we fly back to Barcelona! :)",5,2014,12,25
30,"Excellent hotel ,close to the airport with convenient free shuttle bus","Stayed for 3 nights on my birthday and found a pleasant surprise in my room - piece of cake with a birthday wish note ,which  really made my  day even more special !! 
Rooms are to a high standard with top jet shower and superb view into Barcelona .Location is not central but Metro station is very close ,staff is really nice too",5,2014,12,24
30,"Nice hotel, bad location","Hesperia Tower hotel is a nice hotel with quiet surroundings, located close to airport.
If you like do have drinks accompanied with other guest this hotel is probably not the one for you. During our weekend stay we saw 4-5 other guest. 

Ok restaurant in hotel.
Training facilities is really good as it in a local gym (this is a huge gym). The gym was a bit to crowded for my taste (had to wait to use the machines).

All in all, great hotel, but would book something closer to the city center if you are looking for experiencing the city.",4,2014,12,21
30,Pleasant stay with friends,"Located away from the city but conveniently close to airport, this hotel has a nice convention centre. Stayed here for 4 nights and have wonderful memories. view from room window as well as during ascent and descent of the lifts were superb.Had lots of fun especially during nights. restaurant staff was fully cooperative during night service.
One thig that seemed absurd was that the access to the swimming pool was restricted as they had some funny and peculiar rules and regulations.
Nevertheless, would check in again.",5,2014,12,18
30,Fira Suite 102,"Awesome stay outside the city with a fabulous local centre and local Tapas, and perfect for the Metro into the hub-bub! The water feature in the lake was a nice touch too .. The multi-jet shower in the sumptuous bathroom suite was heavenly.",5,2014,12,17
30,Amazing hotel,We stayed here for a weekend break to Barcelona. The view from the room is amazing. The rooms were nice and clean. It is located near a metro station so that was nice. Also it is near the airport. Loved the stay. No free swimming pool was a down side. ,5,2014,12,15
30,Understated elegance,"I stayed at this hotel 2 days before and 1 day after a cruise . It is a wonderful property, there is limited shuttle service both to the airport and the city center. The staff is excellent. The rooms are
Very nice and comfortable.",5,2014,12,06
30,Oh how I hated staying here!,"Despite beautifully kind and helpful service from the staff this has got to be the gloomiest, most uncomfortable hotel I've ever stayed in. Black, black on black, shiny black, just black. Awful. Plus: no shower caps, no tissues (!), charges for everything from kettle to chargers. Just so depressing. Uncomfortable beds, cheap and nasty pillows, broken windows den. Enough. You get yhe picture. But lovely staff!",2,2014,12,03
30,Average for 5*,"Negatives:
Room is small, wi-fi Internet is unstable, you have to pay for everything besides a room (pool, gym, which are located in a separate building), no bidet (while othe NH hotels have it in rooms). Located very far from most of sightseeings. 

Positives:
Not far from the airport, so it is good for business trips. Free of charge shuttle bus to the airport (but there is a limit of seats in it, about 15, and it goes every 2 hours). Perfect breakfast. Metro station is in 5 minutes walk. Carrefour and Alcampo supermarkets are reachable by taxi in 5 minutes.",3,2014,12,02
30,Great start to your holiday.,"Room was lovely, the view from the room was fantastic at night the staff were friendly and helpful. There is a shuttle bus to the city centre and to the airport. The metro is only 5mins walk from the hotel. There was a 10% tip charged at check out along with 4.50‚Ç¨ tourist rate for each night you stay. Not sure but this might be because we booked it via lastminute and got the room at a discounted rate and this charge is to compensate for that. Didn't mind as it was worth it. at the airport they will advise you to take bus 46. Don't bother, just take a taxi (25‚Ç¨ max) or enquire about the shuttle service before hand.",4,2014,11,29
30,Jazzy Hotel,"We had a great stay at the Hesperia Tower in Barcelona. Its a little outside of the city but easy to get to with the under ground.

The room was stunning with windows to the floor. 

A special mention to Eddie, he was the kindest door man that I have met.

See you again soon Barcelona!",5,2014,11,24
30,Really nice rooms,"Stayed here on an overnight layover in 11/2014. Had booked based on previous TripAdvisor reviews. Really nice property with excellent rooms which, as someone else described, are somewhat unique in layout featuring an ""anteroom"" where the sink, closets, and separate shower and commodes are located. All marble tiling here. Closet includes bathrobe and slippers. Shower is a rainfall type with additional massage jets. The tower is quite high so you get a good elevated view of the surroundings. Wifi is fast. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The restaurant on the second floor is nicely appointed with a decent wine selection. I had the oxtail which was really tender, just a tad underflavored. Breakfast is typical buffet style and runs 18-22 Euros depending on if you pre-book or not.

Main thing to be aware of is that the airport shuttle runs on a fixed schedule, about once an hour if I remember correctly, and there is a gap midday when it runs trips into the center of Barcelona instead of the airport. Best to contact the hotel directly before your trip so you can coordinate with the shuttle service if you want to avoid an expensive cab ride.",5,2014,11,23
30,Luxury business hotel close to airport,"stunning modern design with panoramic views over city especially from the higher floors. We stayed in a suite on the top floor and floor-to-ceiling windows provided breath-taking views especially late night and early morning. Excellent breakfast and very helpful staff. Didn't have time to view pool and leisure facilities. Although close to airport and a 10 min taxi ride to city centre, there is a metro station within a 5 min walk. Only disappointment was the bistro food which failed to live up to expectations. If you have the time, you can explore the suburb behind the hotel with local shops, markets and cafƒós - full of local colour!",4,2014,11,08
30,Very modern hotel with lots if extras,"Opening my room door was a surprise as it took me into a huge ultra modern bathroom with separate toilet cubicle and shower.
Wardrobes all in the bathroom area, then you go through to the bedroom.

Great views from the 10th floor. 
Electric curtains. iPod and iphone 4 docking stations and an ultra modern shower. 

This hotel suits people who enjoy technology. The lifts have a touch pad control unit to help you call the lift based on which floor you are going to.

Common areas very spacious, great food and service.

Big taxi tank outside the door so can go anywhere you need in the city easily.

Would come back again",4,2014,11,05
30,Perfect for short stay,"We visited Barcelona for three days and stayed at this hotel for two nights. It's proximity to the airport is second to none and although there is a free shuttle, we opted to pay ‚Ç¨20 for a 5 minute taxi. Check in was smooth and having been in the UK at 7am, were in the centre of Barcelona by lunchtime!

The hotel is conveniently located a short walk from the start of the red 1 metro line which takes you straight into the centre of Barcelona in around 30 minutes. Unlike metro systems in other cities, in Barcelona you only pay per trip, so you could take as many stops or changes as you like.

Our room was very spacious, extremely comfortable and there was free WiFi throughout the hotel which was a huge bonus. I see some people have mentioned the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room but this never bothered us.

We had breakfast once in the hotel and also ate an evening meal which was absolutely fantastic. The food, the wine and the attentiveness of the waiter was spot on.

For our return trip to the airport, we did make use of the airport shuttle and although it specifies that it will drop you off at Terminal 1, they dropped us off at our terminal (Terminal 2) without any problems.

If we ever visit Barcelona again, we would certainly be looking at this hotel.",5,2014,11,05
30,Ideal for any Fira Barcelona Conference,"Stayed for 4 nights during a conference in Oct. It's about 10-15 mins in the taxi from the Hotel (I arrived at 830PM) but a taxi ride will cost 20 Euros as that's a standard rate - the actual cost is around 15. Apparently there is a shuttle service but it wasn't running at that time.

The hotel itself is very nice, a bit too dark in decor for me, lots of black everywhere but it's stylish. I ate a meal in the restaurant the first night, well just starters as it was quite late (10PM). The salad was v nice and the service very prompt and courteous. 

The room was nice, a little strange though. I was on the 17th floor, and when I walked into the room realised it was the bathroom as opposed to the bathroom. It's a first for me anyway, and always kept me a little nervey when using the bathroom that a cleaner may knock!! Yes, I kept the door locked! The toilet and shower were behind doors it's not that they were just there in the open but still as I said, walking into the bathroom directly from the entrance felt a little strange. Again, lots of black but well lit and plenty of mirrors. The bedroom was well lit, spacious and the bed was good (double), a bit creaky on the end of the bed but fine when sleeping. 

I was out of the room most days from early till late and always found it tidied upon return however I did notice that bottles\cups\old papers were not taken - a McDonald's smoothie lasted the trip on the table, not sure why they didn't take it and I didn't want to throw it in the bin in the room as it would have caused a mess.

With regards to location, if you are attending a conference at the Fira Barcelona (there are two with the same name apparently, check the address to ensure you are at the right one) then it is a short taxi ride away costing approx 9 euros each way. You could get a bus but I never bothered to look for the stop, I did look at the journey via Metro and it's basically an inefficient way round the system that it is more straightforward to get the taxi. To get to the city centre it's approx 25 min Metro ride on the L1 line - 15 stops to Catalunya, the station (Hospital de Bellvitge) is just a short walk through the University Hospital car park (the staff weren't able to communicate this v well they seemed to favour the taxi option so I just asked somebody on the street who happened to be English luckily for me). The Metro runs till midnight so after that it's a taxi at around 15 euros. My company paid for a 5 day Hola BCN travelcard so I used it, it's a better way to experience the city in my opinion but for ease, taxi always wins.

Around the hotel there is nothing to see\do - it's a bit 'rough' to be honest so I wouldn't stay here if I didn't have a conference to attend. However, some may not mind this as a location as it's definitely quieter than being in the centre!",4,2014,11,04
30,Great stay and at a good hotel,"Attending a conference st the Fira, just down the road.

Booked thus hotel s few months in advance to endure I got a great rate, which I achieved.
The room was spacious, clean and very elegant, with a walk in shower and separate clothing storage. 
Used the room service a couple of times when necessary, which was prompt and freshly made.
The check in and out and general service was good, with English speaking receptionist.
Used the adjoining swimming pool, did not like the fact I had to wear a swimming cap, but the pool was clean and relaxing.
Would certainly use thus hotel again, but doubt it would be family friendly. ",5,2014,11,04
30,Another wonderful experience,"Held an event here last week - the staff are brilliant, cannot do enough for you.  The rooms are still very luxurious although getting a little tired now.  Food cannot be faulted - absolutely delicious and plentiful.  Breakfast buffet is well worth a visit.",5,2014,11,04
30,Modern hotel close to the airport!,"Bed 2/5 Mattress was on the firm side (rating 5 for soft and 1 for hard)

Room 5/5 Room was very clean. Desk area and good number of outlets. Room has a flat screen TV. Also Shower warmed up quick. Shower multiple nozzles and a great shower head. The shower has awesome pressure and drained well.

Proximity 3/5 Close to the city airport. About a 10 min drive into the center of Barcelona 

Price $$ 

Overall -Free Internet. Hotel has a restaurant and nice bar. They provide a complementary shuttle service to the center of Barcelona and also to the airport. 

There is not much around so if you want to avoid paying 6 euros for a bottle of water get one before you get back to the hotel.",5,2014,11,03
30,hotel hesperia tower barcelona.,"we arrived at this hotel and were overawed by its size by that we mean its height, wow, airport was only twenty minutes away by taxi. reception staff very friendly and attentive, booked into our room in minutes, although it was room only basis ,we cant look a gift horse in the mouth although my husband paid for himself, I was treated for the weekend to see my grand daughter who had travelled down from Madrid, and did not know we were there . what a surprise for her. room was fantastic, went out for breakfast in the mornings , and had lunch in city centre , all reasonably priced. stayed in hotel for dinner, although expensive was well worth it . must say we had a fantastic weekend with our grand daughter. very tempted to come to Barcelona again.",5,2014,11,03
30,Off the beat and track and not worth the money. Very poor.,"The location was by far the most disappointing feature of this hotel closely followed by the lack of atmosphere, overpriced bar and complete misrepresentation of the photos from the website. We carefully choose this hotel from the photos and description ok their and several others websites. Unfortunately, we were left very disappointed. The hotel is in the middle or nowhere. There is not a shop for miles or a pub or restaurant or Anything in fact. The hotel did not have an outside area as described and in fact not even a smoking area. To smoke you had to stand outside the front door. There was no leisure facilities. There was a nearby swimming pool that you could go to for a free. The bar was an absolute rip off drinks were far too expensive and the bar was badly laid out more like a reception area and no atmosphere whatsoever. We had to complain because we had no power for hours and we were left waiting in room. I asked for an adapter which they charged me. ‚Ç¨5 for one someone had clearly left behind !! Also if though we had prepaid we were alarmed to be charged an extra ‚Ç¨80 on leaving for some tax we were never told about! There are so many amazing places in barcelona. This is NOT one of them ",2,2014,11,03
30,Double wow!,"We chose this hotel because we had a night between our connexion and it is close to the airport. We went to that hotel few year ago for few nights and we where amazed how well maintained and spotless it was. We liked it so much we did not want to go downtown for dinner, we decided to stay there and enjoy it. First, the staff at the reception were really nice, they offered the option of having an upgrade to a suite, wich we did and that was the best decision ever. The suite was so nice, comfortable,welcoming clean and well decorated. Loved the bathtub! We did order some room service, it was fast and very nicely served. There is a very nice gym, a beautiful restaurant and a very trendy lobby bar.They also have a free shuttle to go to the airport. Also, the free wifi is appreciated. It was a perfect stay.",5,2014,11,02
30,Lovely,"Great views, lovely room, easy transport links, all in all a nice hotel. The only thing that was a bit of a pain was finding our way around the hotel. It was my partners birthday while we were staying at the hotel and we got home one evening to find a birthday cake and a little note to say happy birthday. How cute.",4,2014,10,31
30,Nice hotel let down by service,"I stayed for a night here whilst on business and while the hotel itself is very attractive, the service really let it down. Upon arrival there were no rooms available at that point in the day to check in to, which was a little frustrating as we couldn't freshen up in our rooms or get changed before the conference began - understandable however given that it was not yet 3pm. The staff, however, were not that helpful and simply told us that we would have to check back at regular intervals to see if a room had become unavailable (not easy to do when at a conference all day). Thinking I might freshen up in the spa, I was told it was ‚Ç¨14 just to use the facilities - something I have never come across before in a 5* hotel. The room itself - once I finally checked in - was lovely, spacious, clean and elegant. There were, however, no tea and coffee facilities in the room which I think is ridiculous for this kind of hotel, and no iron which was quite frustrating. When I asked about the iron at the front desk they said I had to request one using the phone in my room, and despite me saying I would need one imminently if possible I still had to go back to the room and call the same person I'd been speaking to (after it rang through several times). After saying one would be sent up straight away, it arrived over an hour later by which time I had to leave for dinner and wasn't even able to use it. The aesthetic of this hotel meets a five star standard, but the service and ridiculous charges for typically free services/ amenities means that I wouldn't stay in this hotel again, unfortunately.",3,2014,10,27
30,Great hotel,"We booked this hotel for a one night stay before a cruise. First of all the downside of the NH Hotel group is their dreadful website it gives no information on the airport shuttle you cannot download a menu for the restaurant and no matter how many times you email, they don't answer and that includes the CEO. We eventually did a webchat to get the airport transfer times and luckily he sent a transcript . We arrived at Terminal 2 and took the airport bus to Terminal 1 had a long walk to find where the hotel bus left from waited 30 mins after the   time slot of 12.20. No bus arrived, another walk back to the taxi rank, the taxi took 10 mins and was ‚Ç¨20. When we challenged the hotel they looked puzzled especially when they saw the webchat email as all of the shuttle times were wrong.
So why give 5 stars ? We were given a beautiful room on the 15th floor with a view over Barcelona (ask for even numbered room)  everything was to a very high standard, robes , slippers etc. We had booked dinner in the Bouquet restaurant for 7.30. This was one of the nicest hotel restaurants that we have eaten in, not soulless like most and surprisingly busy for a Sunday night. We chose the ‚Ç¨30 set menu which was 4 courses. The food was delicious and accompanied with beautiful bread rolls and little bottles of olive oil. Coffee came with a little sardine tin that when opened contained chocolate almonds, all the little touches that make a restaurant stand out, along with outstanding staff. When we asked for the bill he arrived with a blank page ! Their way of saying sorry for the earlier mix up. Very well done Hesperia Tower, but NH Hotel group need to learn some customer relations from their own hotel staff !
There is a metro 5mins walk from the hotel and fourteen short stops takes you to Catalunya which is the top of the Ramblas.",5,2014,10,27
30,hesperia tower hotel,"fine if you need to be close to the airport. located in a low-housing area of the west-end of
Barcelona. Far from downtown. Rooms are large for euro standards, very modern and
comfortable. Vert quiet.service was ok. rates reasoneable but all else is extra and expensive.
Remember that a cab ride downtown will set you back 20 Euros",4,2014,10,26
30,Great Hotel,"Hotel was stunning, Rooms and lobby very modern. I couldnt really find much within walking distance of the hotel so we taxi'ed into the centre most evenings. Food at the hotel was decent if a little pricey. I would certainly recommend anyone to stay here.",5,2014,10,26
30,Worst Service I have ever received in a 5 star hotel,"Do not be fooled by the beautiful exterior and interior of the hotel. The service staff sucks big time. From check in to reuesting from room service, their attitude is really bad. My 3rd time in Bacelona and i will never stay here if they gave me a room for free. ",1,2014,10,25
30,Would Stay Again,"I had second thoughts about this hotel.  People loved it or hated it. I am happy to be in the prior category.

First, if you want something in the middle of things, this is not your hotel. It is a ways from La Rambla.  It makes up for that by price and convenience.  It is across the parking lot from the Subway, and has multiple shuttles per day to the center of town and the airport.

The hotel is very modern and sleek with beautiful rooms.  It would have been even better with refrigerators and coffee.  The beds were comfortable and make sure you see the pillow menu. The staff was friendly and efficient but seemed to be very busy.  One reason is Barcelona is a cruise ship port, and this is a cruise line affiliated hotel, including transfers.

What the hotel lacked was free coffee and breakfast.  You can buy wonderful coffee from the bar and there is a rather expensive breakfast buffet.  We left early and ate in town.There was also a neighborhood cafe within 2 blocks that sold excellent and inexpensive food.",5,2014,10,24
30,Overpriced and a long way out of the city,"I stayed here in August 2014 on a city break.  The hotel was very modern with a high quality finish in the room.  

Bar and restaurant were expensive.  Swimming pool/ health club was charged separately which was not made clear at the time of booking.

Hotel is convenient for the airport but takes about 30 minutes to get into city centre.",3,2014,10,24
30,Beautiful hotel - but need train to Central Barcelona,Beautiful hotel with lovely facilities but is quite expensive for food/drink.  Rooms are very modern and spacious.  Our bathroom was gorgeous.   If you wish to visit central Barcelona you need to travel by train - station a short walk away. Very easy to get into centre but if you have mobility problems it may not be suitable.   Very quiet residential location.   Would visit this hotel again.,4,2014,10,21
30,"seemed to be good, but coming closer only so,so","Three days in this five* hotel allowed me for such evaluation. The hotel itself is quite good, but far from perfection. First of all i was thirsty and i couldn't find the bottle of free water in the room. Kettle service was paid. Cleaning almost good. Service was the best among all evaluating things. Breakfast was good, but it was rather an art then strong breakfast. A/C was ok and double door was the thing i liked much. Generaly√∑ very good.",4,2014,10,21
30,Not impressed for a 5-star hotel,"While the hotel looks very nice and the rooms are spacious and decorated nicely, I would expect more from a 5-star hotel. The staff was friendly enough. The location is not great if you want to be close to Barcelona and there doesn't appear to be anything around the immediate location. The bathroom floor was not spotless, especially around the corners, which raises concerns about cleanliness. Additionally, I have never been to a hotel where EVERYTHING was an extra. I do not expect that out of a 5-star hotel. Kettles, plug converters, fitness center, pool, etc. From what I'm reading, these things are included with suite rooms but to consider yourself a 5-star hotel, I would expect at least some of these things to be included with all rooms. Also, don't forget, flip flops and swimming caps are required for the pool, save yourself from having to buy yet another thing from the hotel. ",3,2014,10,20
30,Typical Conference Center Hotel,I was in Barcelona for a conference.  This hotel serves that purpose.  The location is charmless and is essentially an airport hotel.  My room was sufficient and clean but the decor is very dark and it's difficult to see.  The moment my conference ended I left for a downtown Barcelona setting.  Staff was very nice and it is very easy to get a taxi. ,3,2014,10,19
30,"Out of the way hotel, is it still in Barcelona?","Stayed at this hotel for a conference and it is perfect for that. It is close to the airport but very far from the city centre so not sure if it is technically still Barcelona so I would not choose it if I was going for a leisure trip. That said the hotel was clean, spacious and quite modern (lots of black boudoir style marble, not quite my taste but functional) with a great conference area but it was let down by a few things. The food was not up to par for a 5 star property, the burger was a frozen meat slab and I had to pay 20 euro for the pleasure. I could not eat it, and to top it off the fries were soggy and my colleagues club sandwich was equally terrible. So do not come here for the food. The other thing is that you have to pay extra for the pool and several other amenities I would expect to be free in a 5 star hotel. I am not terribly impressed with the staff had to wait till 5pm before my room was ready and had to show my passport 3 times to 3 different people,very strange especially since the room was pre-paid. Would come and stay again for a conference, but definitely eat elsewhere and for leisure I would stay well away.",4,2014,10,19
30,Half and half,"4 night stay, very pretty hotel however everything is extra, you have to pay extra for the gym, pool, a kettle, iron, all the things you expect to be included are extra.

We expected the sentence 'you wish to wipe your backside with our toilet role, that will be ‚Ç¨5'

Otherwise it's clean and staff are good",3,2014,10,18
30,Great Hotel!!!,"We stay in Hesperia Towers for the second time and just love it.
It's good for everything as hotel has free shuttles to city center, airport and Gava beach. Also tube  is just 5 min walk.
However, the best way to rent a car (that's what we prefer). Car park in hotel probably is little bit expensive, however, there is plenty of free parking around.
Great hotel in the Great City!!!",5,2014,10,14
30,3 night break,"We visited this hotel for 1 night on floor ten a nice room but a little tired leaky shower. Views lovely hotel lobby lovely staff friendly. Quite impressed overall. Toiletries in the bathroom provided including hair conditioner * and a fabulous light up magnifying make up mirror and good hair dryer also robes but only one pair of slippers?
We returned after our cruise for two nights and upgraded our room to a suite on the 25th floor at a cost of 55 euro per night. On first impressions a nice room with lower and upper levels. This room had a kettle but it costs 12 euros for coffee and tea bags and 5 euros to change the water!
We had dirty used cups on arrival the bin had used tissues in it. Two sets of bathrobes provided two pairs of slippers and the same toiletries as before, however the magnifying mirror didn't work this time don't think the cost is worth the upgrade. A taxi ride into Barcelona costs 20 - 25 euros however the hotel provides a free timetabled shuttle bus. Breakfast is lovely lots to choose from.",3,2014,10,13
30,Wonderful hotel,"Recently stayed at the Hesperia tower hotel with my partner and we were both very happy with the hotel, clean, lovely rooms great staff just what we needed for a quick 2 night city break would recommend.",5,2014,10,09
30,Upmarket hotel with good facilities.," We had a 3 night stay in a suite on the 19th floor. The suite was very big, as was the bed, and very comfortable, although some of the furniture was starting to look a little bit tired. The views from the room were fantastic.
Although the hotel is a little way from the city centre, the metro station was just across the road and it was a quick journey straight into the centre of Barcelona.
We had a great stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay at Hesperia Tower again.",4,2014,10,08
30,Aging Beauty Queen,"I agree with many of the other reviews here.  This once-glamorous property has seen better days.  It remains, however, a convenient airport property not far from the Barcelona city center.  Cabs park outside near the hotel, 24hrs, so it's always easy to find one into the city or to the airport.  The hotel will keep your luggage until check-in.  This is convenient.  The room was large, roomy & well-appointed.  The hotel grounds and interior are aging and in need of an update.  The common area sofas appeared to be loungers with deep wells & pockets where too many have rested before.  New furnishings are needed.  We didn't try the restaurant.  Wifi and other room amenities were acceptable.  Reception staff were busy, but courteous and professional.",4,2014,10,05
30,Good place to be,"Personnel not r√©aly attentive to customer's wishes
Ask for a room in Barcelone direction and fer one faces to the Airport
The h√¥tel situation is a bit far ax√¢t from city center bute asily a cr√©dible by metro",4,2014,10,02
30,A five star hotel.,"Picked this hotel because it offered a shuttle to the airport and a taxi ride from the pier to here would be around ‚Ç¨25.00.  The staff was exceptional (except when asked if the Corte Ingl√©s at Plaza de Catalu√±a opened on Sundays was told no, but our taxi driver had said that it was), the rooms were large, and modern and the shower exceptional.  There is a metro stop about 200 yards away in the parking lot of the near-by hospital so making it to downtown is easy.",5,2014,10,01
30,Great hotel not so great location.,"Upon arriving at barcelona airport we got a cab to the hotel which charged us 30‚Ç¨ plus extra charges we felt that we were being ripped off as the  hotel is only around a 10 minute drive from the airport so be careful as I'm pretty sure you can get on th  metro line or bus to the hotel. There is a free shuttle bus running from the Hotel to the airport but it runs at odd times.we then tried to check in but there were no rooms available so we had to wait for a further 2 hours before being checked into our room. We decided to explore the area and found that there was nothing around at all not even a shop. We had requested upon booking a smoking room which when we got there we were told  was unavailable however the manager was able go sort that out for us and we then proceeded to check in. The room was clean and tidy and trendy we absolutely loved it. The view was just amazing and beautiful. The bathroom was plush and came with slippers and a robe and the shower was so great and everything was modern. The TV has no English channel apart from the news so if you have a tablet download some films before you go as netflix is unavailable in spain. The metro line is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel and it takes you to anywhere  in barcelona. 10 journeys cost 10‚Ç¨ so it is definitely cost effective. I would suggest booking a bus tour around barcelona you can book it with the hotel for a good price. Places I would suggest visiting would be Catalunya, sagrada famillia,nou camp, port Olympic. If the weather is good barceloneta beach is a must. There are great restaurants by the beach such a Pacha which are pricey but worth it. As for nightlife I would suggest Olympic the nightlife is good but pricey.",4,2014,10,01
30,Room needs a makeover ,"The modern architecture was appealing and we even got used to the elevator kiosk that calls the elevator and tells you which one to get on. However the sofa in the room had a rip in the fabric, the furniture was scratched, and carpet stained. In spite of that disappointment, the stay was comfortable. The metro stop was across the street and the metro was easy to use  ",3,2014,09,29
30,Business Hotel,Great rooms with comfy bed  decor was good as was the view but more business than pleasure its quiet far out from the centre but close to the airport.Loved the lift system and the breakfast was really good .,4,2014,09,28
30,Very good service and quality space,"I went to a conference at the Hesperia Towers.  The hotel is very good and the staff were lovely and went out of their way to be helpful.  It's close to the airport but a way from the city though there's a metro line close by and taxis are cheap and plentiful.  The room was good though the air con was noisy (it woke me up at regular intervals through the night - sounded like a plane taking off).  The food in the restaurants was of very good quality and the food provided for meetings and the conference was excellent and plentiful.  Unfortunate the coffee and hot water for tea tended to the lukewarm - very Spanish.

It was a great venue for a conference - the facilities were good and everything including projection ran smoothly.  

Good though - I'd stay here again.",4,2014,09,27
30,Fantastic hotel,"Easy check in, spectacular modern design, I did have coffee in my room, great views. Little out of the city but only cost 10 euro in a taxi through day and shuttle bus free. About 10 minutes of camp nou everything in reach. The spa and gym next door is amazing, worth paying for if not included in the hotel cost. Room service great. Staff nice and friendly. No complaints.",5,2014,09,24
30,Disappointed with the room quality,"We travelled to this hotel in July 2014 and upon arrival we were greeted by a spectacular foyer. After being persuaded to upgrade our room we took a spilt level duplex on the 25th floor expecting a high standard of room and service. Complimentary tea and coffee was provided but to our disappointment it was only for the first day. If we wanted additional tea, coffee or water we would have to pay for it! In my mind, we'd paid extra to have additional facilities. Upon entering the second floor of the duplex I noticed the bedding was frayed and falling apart. The wood at the bottom of the sink area was coming away from the wall due to damp. The light fixtures were broken or badly damaged and given the size of the room only one sink was in the room as opposed to two which is standard for most large chain hotels throughout Europe. If we wanted to use the pool we had to walk next door to the local community swimming pool which we had to pay ‚Ç¨16 per person per day, ensure we wore swimming caps at all times and appropriate footwear. I was on holiday and had no real desire to use a community pool, I can do that in the UK for a lot less. The breakfast was mediocre at best. Cold, dry and unappetising. We weren't inspired to try any of the other restaurants in the hotel. This is not a five star hotel! You can see other areas of the hotel have fallen into disrepair and thankfully we didn't pay the full price as advertised on the hotel website. In terms of location it's 20mins away by taxi to La Ramblas and across the road from the train station. Frankly there are tater hotels in Barcelona. We returned in August but stayed at the Melia Sky Barcelona which was infinitely better across the board. It had its own local Ramblas, not far from the beach with views of Sagrada Familia...stay there instead and avoid the Hesperia Tower. I won't be staying in any of this chains hotels again and I stay in a few.",2,2014,09,23
30,not 5 star,"An average stay at this hotel, located away from the city , but a number of things didnt prove to us that this is a 5 star hotel, apart from the expensive pricing the room had no tea and coffee making facilities , to be fair it didn't advertise that they provided this, but frankly I need a cup of coffee before facing the world on a new day and this hotel didnt and couldnt provide this facility? Alot of effort and expense has clearly been provided at this hotel to provide guest facilities but they need to get the basics right. Breakfast was an average affair with some hot food actually cold. Wouldn't repeat this experience.",3,2014,09,21
30,"Very nice, close to airport",Stayed here on my last night in Barcelona. Rooms was chic modern and state of the art bathrooms and shower.  This hotel is close to airport which is a big plus. Breakfast and lunch was a little overpriced.,4,2014,09,19
30,nice hotel,"We landed in Barcelona and was picked up by the hotels free shuttle bus. The collection times were not clear. If we got a taxi to the hotel it would have cost us 20euro. 
When we arrived at the hotel, the outside didn't look that great but the inside was lovely. The rooms were very spacious. The shower was very powerful with different settlings. We asked for a double bed, what we got was two single beds pushed together (much to my partners delight!). It was unfortunate that the restaurant that was situated on the top of the tall hotel was closed. We got a good deal when staying at this hotel, if the deal was going again, I would return.
It is a 5 min walk to the nearest tube station.",4,2014,09,18
30,Hesperia Tower - My No. 1 Choice in Barcelona,I had the pleasure of staying at the Hesperia Tower this month and enjoyed every minute of it. The Staff especially at the Reception were very helpful and catered to my every whim. Roger especially who could give Google Maps a run for their money always guided me around the city with such ease. If you're a gym fanatic they have a state-of-the-art gym. I upgraded to a Junior Suite which was just lovely. With easy access to the Metro from the hotel I feel I have found my ideal hotel in Barcelona. Once again I would like to thank everyone at Hesperia Tower for making my stay so wonderful and I hope to see you all very soon,5,2014,09,18
30,"Very nice hotel, but not well located","If you are visiting Barcelona to see the city attractions, this is not a good hotel to stay in.  Yes, it is located near a metro line, but it is the last stop on the metro, which means that to many of the sights we were traveling 30-40 minutes and transferring lines.  When I arrived back at my stop around midnight I had to cross a ramp from the highway and walk across a very dark and largely deserted hospital parking lot to get to the hotel.  On the last day of my visit, I wanted dinner at about 7:30 p.m. in the hotel and options were extremely limited as the only restaurant serving in the hotel was very expensive.  Had the hotel been located centrally, I could have walked out and found a restaurant, but that is not so with this hotel.  I met at least 7 more people in the lobby from my tour who were all having the same problem deciding if they wanted to take a taxi just to get a bite to eat.  
The rooms are nice and big, well air-conditioned, and people were pleasant, so if you just need a place to lay your head, then this might be fine.  The restaurant looked very pretty.",3,2014,09,17
30,You get more then what you pay for,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my partner for my birthday, the hotel is fantastic, not quiet in the centre but there is a metro a couple of minuets walk away which takes about 25 minuets or you can catch a cab outside the hotel which is approx 12 euros, didn't use the restaurant but had breakfast room service which was delicious! Had a surprise birthday cake waiting in the room for when we got back which was a very nice touch, the rooms are very spacious and modern. Had a fantastic birthday thanks to hesperia tower! Would definatley recommend! ",4,2014,09,16
30,Meh...,"This hotel is situated in the outskirts of Barcelona close to the airport and the convention centre. While there is nothing wrong with the rooms or the conference facilities, overall the service is a big let down. The staff appear clueless or disinterested and are not proactive with helping their guests. 

Some aspects are just not acceptable, the 14 euros surcharge for using the next door fitness is outrageous. The fact that three of out four bars in the middle of the tourist season were closed is a bit odd. And finally room service order delivered 45min late was inedible and ridiculously overpriced. There are many great hotels in Barcelona, so do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else.",2,2014,09,16
30,Don't be fooled by the pictures!,"Whilst this hotel is very nice, clean, modern and the rooms are a good size IT IS NOT A SPA HOTEL. The pictures of the gym, spa and pools are of the sports centre next door and costs extra to use along with the general public. There is parking in the garage below the hotel but again this costs extra to use and is not cheap so best to park on the street outside. No tea and coffee making facilities in the room but you can of course order from room service ... Shame really because this hotel spoils itself by charging extra for every little thing that should be included.",3,2014,09,16
30,Great Stay,"My partner and I booked this hotel last minute and got a great price for what was given. The standard double room we booked was stylish and luxurious with incredible views across the city. Unfortunately for the first few nights we had some trouble with locking our door but once we'd reported it, an electrician was called in to fix the door within a couple of hours. Although the tv only had Spanish channels, free wifi brought my partner and I enough entertainment. Our room was cleaned daily and to a very good standard, and on our last night my partner was pleasantly surprised with a complimentary cake as we were celebrating his birthday. We didn't eat in the hotel, but there was a petrol station across the road that we used to buy nibbles and drinks from. The direct location isn't too amazing but there's a metro only a 3 minute walk away which is cheap and has direct lines to Las Ramblas and Port Olimpica. We were surprised to discover that there was an extra charge of 15‚Ç¨ per person to use the hotel pool (open 7am-10pm), and swimming hats had to be worn at all times. It works out cheaper to get the metro to the beach, to buy a sunbed for the day, and sip on a mojito whilst you're there. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. We would definitely come back again. ",4,2014,09,16
30,High quality hotel with a few missed opportunities,"The Hesperia Tower feels very luxurious as soon as you enter. The lobby is among the best of any hotel I've been to, and the bar is fantastic. The room we had was of a similar high standard, although there were a few slight niggles - mark on the headboard, hole in the sheet, creaking sliding door and confusing AC controls. Nothing major, just little problems you'd rather not notice. The hotel staff, especially the concierge, were helpful and welcoming. 
There are a few oddities which bring this down from a 5 rating. The shuttle bus schedule is fairly minimal, and drove off with us standing waiting for it once. We took a local bus to Gava for the beach, but when I checked my phone to see where the hotel shuttle picked up from Gava, it simply says 'Gava Beach', which is not quite enough information. The hotel has a few amenities it doesn't advertise well, the Terrace Bar is practically hidden and the restaurants are only evident if you stop on each floor and investigate them. It was quite vexing to find that the top floor restaurant is now closed, as this isn't clearly advertised anywhere on the website. Also a few quirks with service, we were somewhat surprised to have a member of staff walk into the room while we were in there, to check the mini bar. The location, although it reduces the price of the room significantly, is a drag after a while, as it's a full 30 minutes in to Catalunya or 20 minutes to change at the world's hottest metro station, Espanya. Not unbearable, but twice a day, the journey starts to grate.
That said, the quality of the property is undeniable. Room service was fantastic, the bar is relaxing and easy to use, and the room was very comfortable. I'd recommend this for a quiet stay in Barcelona - the metro is cheap and for the price, the hotel is fantastic.",4,2014,09,16
30,Mixed blessings,"Long weekend trip where we wanted luxury for a birthday celebration. We upgraded to a 25th floor suite for a reasonable amount and the views alone were worth it. On closer inspection we found more faded grandure than excellence. We needed the repair man on the first night for our air con and the lack of hot water, dirty wall paper and windows. They wanted to charge 5 euros just to deliver a bottle of water to the room and the complimentary tea and coffee was not replenished, you had to pay extra. Location was OK but there are much better hotels with similar views closer into the center of Barcelona. Hotel cocktail bar and reception was warm and friendly but the pool situation was a farce being part of a gym and an extra daily charge per person plus you had to wear hats. The birthday cake was a nice touch but if the lights were on at this hotel the five stars were certainly not out for our stay.  Went back in August and stayed at the Meile Sky instead.and loved it.",3,2014,09,14
30,Excellent business hotel,"Hesperia Tower is a real 5* hotel in Barcelona, excellent option if you are not there for tourism. Why? Because it is 35/40min by metro from where everything happens. If you are in business, it is an excellent option, nearby the airport and one of the fira complexes. Asentioned going downtown need a 35min travel on the red line L1 from hospital station till castellana. Amenities on the hotel are impressive and the food is also top quality. To come back.",5,2014,09,12
30,NOT a 5-star hotel!!!,"We booked the Hesperia Tower for 1-night as an extension to our preceding nights in Barcelona, where we stayed in the City Center. Unfortunately, our hotel in the centre was booked out when we decided to stay an extra day in Barcelona, so, the Hesperia Tower offered a good location along the L1 metro line (red line) and was located near the airport as well. 
When we got our room keys, we waited for the elevator to arrive. The elevator lobby was so dark with no ceiling lights or other lights other than spot lights coming from the glass floor‚Ä¶So weird. Never been in a hotel lobby that was so dark with insufficient lighting. This problem didn‚Äôt stop here. 
When we got into our rooms, the first impression was that the room was very spacious with washroom and bedroom being separated by a glass door.
We had a baby with us, so we needed the fridge of the mini bar to store some milk. But the fridge did not work. All drinks stored in the mini bar were warm‚Ä¶ After several calls to the front desk, a hotel staff finally showed up after 45 MINUTES of waiting to fix that issue by changing the room for us. So fair enough, the same problem was in the other room we moved to. We didn't want to waste more time in the room, so asked them to get this problem fixed while we were out. In the meanwhile they stored the milk for us at the front desk‚Äôs fridge.
When we got back to the room in the evening, the fridge was working, but then we realized that there was no coffee/tea maker or kettle in the room. Every 4-star hotel I had stayed in had some sort of coffee maker, but this is supposed to be a 5-star hotel and there was no coffee maker in a standard room?! We called room service and they brought us a kettle and charged us 5 EUR for the kettle‚Ä¶      
Next thing we noticed is that there were no facial tissues in the bathroom either. Seriously??? I called room service again and they came to our room with 2 rolls of toilet paper. I said that I was requesting a box of facial tissue but I was told that they don‚Äôt have facial tissues‚Ä¶.
For some reason our room had 3 telephones in the room. Who needs 3 telephones in 1 room?I‚Äôd rather had 1 telephone and a box of tissues instead‚Ä¶
Then, when taking a shower, I noticed that there was no light inside the shower. The only light that was installed in the shower was a small light coming from the glass wall that separates the toilet and the shower. It was so dark in the shower. Never showered in the dar before. If you don‚Äôt care whether you can see while taking a shower, then this hotel is right for you.
Those are really standard items you‚Äôd find and expect in a 3-star hotel, let alone in a 5-star, so the Hesperia Tower is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel‚Ä¶Poor service and bad location‚Ä¶ I would not recommend nor stay here again when returning to Barcelona.",2,2014,09,11
30,Perfect pre-cruise hotel!,"This hotel is located between the airport and the cruise port.  The rooms are very clean and large.  High tech and beautiful lobby, elevators, etc. The on-site restaurant offered a nice selection for jet-lagged travellers. There weren't many restaurants located within walking distance. Their shuttle schedule from the airport wasn't running when we needed it but a cab was about 25 euros including the tip. The cab to the cruise port was only about 20 euros. I would highly recommend this hotel for a one  night stay before a cruise out of Barcelona.",5,2014,09,10
30,"""Superb hotel with extremely friendly staff""","We went to Barcelona for my partners significant birthday. The hotel was extremely clean and tidy. 
Could not fault it. We knew that it was out of town before we booked it, but the metro system is brilliant (in fact there was maintenance work on the metro which meant it terminated two stops from the hotel, but a special bus was laid on which dropped us off right outside the hotel, so worked out well)
All the staff were incredibly helpful and spoke perfect English and booked us a taxi for 4.30 am to get us to the bus station.
We had a really nice surprise on the Sunday evening when we got back to the room, there was a beautiful chocolate cake for Joanne's birthday, a really nice touch.
Overall a 5* experience from a 5* hotel, would recommend the Hesperia to anyone, and will definitely be going back",5,2014,09,10
30,*** Great Hotel ***,"We were at this hotel for 8 days. Is excellent service and room was very good. We will visit this hotel again. It is very good located and 5 star experience. Thank you for comfortable holiday .  
Mr.& Mrs. Sangawiang . ",5,2014,09,10
30,"Nice modern, clean, spacious apartment","Great place to stay although further away from City Center but still convenient with free shuttle bus and nearby metro. Another plus point is the bus 46 that take you straight to the airport for only 2.15 euro, very convenient. Only negative is that we were not allowed to use the swimming pool unless we pay 10 euro per person. We were allowed in our room at 9:30 am which is really helpful",4,2014,09,10
30,2 days in Barcelona,Hesperia Hotel is an excellent hotel!! It's near the airport and have a shuttle service to Barcelona Downtown! The breakfast was very nice! The only negative aspect is the fact that you have to pay for extra activities!!,5,2014,09,10
30,Great hotel,Great hotel with great views. Stayed for 4 nights and had fantastic time. State of the art bathrooms and great restaurant downstairs. Had some issues with booking(my fault) but the team managed to sort things out. Lovely foyer hangout place too.,5,2014,09,10
30,Modern and pleasant property a bit far from downtown.,We found the property to be clean and very pleasant.  It was about 15 or twenty minutes from down town Barcelona.  However since we used a guide with a car each day it didn't make any difference.The hotel is very modern.  Staff was very friendly.  They have a delightful coffee and cocktail bar outside to the rear of the lobby which we found very relaxing at the end of each day of touring this fantastic city. Hotel has a shuttle from the airport but we couldn't find it.  Actually that worked out rather well because that's how we found our English speaking taxi driver who became our guide for the next three days.,4,2014,09,04
30,Balmy In Barcelaona,"My Wife Was Celebrating A Significant Birthday, So Off We Went To Barcelona, We Had Booked In To The Hesperia Tower Hotel. Before We Arrived At The Hotel, I Sent An Email To Ask If We Could Check in A Bit Earlier, As Our Flight Got In At 12.00pm, They Replied, Saying That If They Had The Room Ready We Could. Upon Arrival, We Were Told That The Room Had Not Been Cleaned, And That We Would Have To Wait Until Check In Time, Which Was At 3.00pm. When We Went To Our Room, We Were Disappointed To Find Burns In The Carpet, The Room Was Average, With A Nice En-Suite Shower Room. My Wife Wanted To Use The Hotel Pool, So She Went To Reception, And Was Told That She Had To Wear A Swim Hat, And That There Was A Fee Of Just Under 15 Euro's per Visit, We Have Stayed In Many 5 Star Hotels & Spa's, and Have Never Had To Pay, To Use The Hotels Pool, So We Never Used Any Of The Facilities. The Hotel Is A Fair Distance From Downtown Barcelona, Although We Were Told That They Have A Metro Rail Station 5 Minutes Walk Away, But Unfortunately The Station Was Undergoing Some Engineering Work Going On, So We Had To Get A Courtesy Bus From Across The Road, To The Nearest Metro Station, Then A Good 20-30 Minute Train Ride To Get In To The City. Overall, The Hotel Is OK, But Beware The Hidden Charges, Plus The Tourist Tax of 5 Euro's per Day. I Was Also Asked To Pay For Items From The Mini Bar, That We Never Had, And When I Asked The Receptionist, What We Were Supposed To Of Had, She Said She Did Not Know. The Only Pleasant Surprise Was A Birthday Cake For My Wife.",3,2014,09,03
30,I loved it (( Hesperia Tower)),"A very good place with high proficiency , modern and worthy to visit 
The decoration is very good and nice , 
There was a football match between FCB & Athlitico ad the preparation in the hotel was amazing , TVs , flags , chairs and tables all were decorated to let u live the event 

I spent there 3 nights , will never forget them",5,2014,09,02
30,Perfect for any couple or businessperson,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Hesperia Hotel for 5 nights at the end of August 2014. We found an incredible deal at the start of August which we thought was too good to miss - a 5* Hotel only 10/15 minutes from the centre of Barcelona by Taxi (which cost roughly about 13-17 Euros each time), with fantastic spa facilities and a very special exclusive 'Tower Club' which we had free access to by paying only a little extra per night for a Suite (Worth it!).

We really lived the high life on this holiday and we think Hesperia was the biggest reason for this. Their room service is incredible, their 24 hour assistance at reception is great, the food (whether you have it at one of the restaurants available, or even in your room) was delicious, and the access to Taxis at this hotel couldn't be simpler. We were on the 25th floor overlooking the centre and coastline of Barcelona from a distance. 

One of the many memorable moments from our stay here was on my birthday. I had not told them it was my birthday while we were staying there, but I'm guessing from looking at my passport or maybe from the birthday cards spread out across the bedroom, they went out of their way to bring me ""room service"" which happened to be a birthday cake for us to share. A very nice touch. 

Overall I would say it is the perfect stay for a couple or businessperson who does not want to stay in the heart of Barcelona, but still wants to access it from time to time. Ps. you'll never want to leave the Jacuzzi!",5,2014,09,02
30,fantastic,"Three night stay here and loved every minute. Hotel was lovely with great views and the staff were very friendly. City centre is not far on the metro, so I cant comment on the hotel food as we visited different restaurants every night. For our breakfast we visited a small deli just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel, Fresh croissants and lovely coffee for 3 euro. lovely !!.",5,2014,08,31
30,awesome,"i stayed here with my daughter on a 5 day city break, we were impressed by the decor inside the hotel it was beautiful, clean, modern and the staff were very helpful, particularly the restaurant staff. the rooms were clean and very modern, the view across Barcelona was spectacular. we ate in the restaurant 3 times and the food was lovely and very well presented, the staff attentive and helpful. i would highly recommend this hotel as extremely good value for money.",5,2014,08,29
30,Perfect,"The rooms were spacious and comfortable, we enjoyed our fantastic city view and all staff were friendly and helpful.

The hotel was far away from the centre of the city however the hotel provides a free shuttle bus from to and from the hotel, city, airport and beach. The drop off point in the city is only a 2 minute  walk from the tourist bus stop.

The breakfast and dinner at the hotel was very nice and I would recommend it but remember to book breakfast at least a day in advance for 15‚Ç¨ rather than paying 25‚Ç¨ on the day.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2014,08,29
30,"Quality and customer service issues - too much hassle for a good, relaxed time","This is our second night here. So, far my view is that for a hotel so far away from the city centre they need to pay more attention to customer service and quality. There are some little issues, but they all add up...If you've got the gym and pool access included in your package and you expect to be able to go in and out of the spa and gym as you wish, think again - you're only allowed one visit per day and will have to pay for returns. Also, you provide your own room service if you want any ice in your room: we were told we have to bring our room ice bucket down for it to be filled! Is that normal? I don't know - and no executive lounge access..? I thought a suite in a five star hotel meant no worries and you could expect the best service available. But unfortunately, that's not been our experience so far. Also, although we have a lovely view from the top floor, the room has had numerous issues - for which they're quick to find excuses - or not at all e.g. throughout the first night and in the morning we heard loud music coming through into the bedroom of our suite coming from somewhere nearby - and had to complain. It was resolved immediately somehow but we received no explanation and no apology for a disturbed first nights sleep. Although we are in what is supposed to be one of the finest rooms, it wasn't cleaned properly - used cups left in the room, no replacements, the bed was not made (we put the covers on before we left for the day so I guess they didn't bother to do a proper job). Then we found the phone was't working...just little things but they add up when you're staying in and paying for a five star hotel. Our experience of the reception management was that they were all too quick to make excuses but had no real understanding or value for customer experience - a pity when customers are paying good money for what they expect is a quality brand. There's nothing much in the area of the hotel and the lack of helpfulness of the staff, various issues, processes and restrictions one isn't encouraged to spend much time on the site - a pity and a missed opportunity for the hotel. So far, too much hassle for a really good, relaxed time.",2,2014,08,27
30,Great 5 Star Hotel at 3 Star Prices,"Quality of the hotel was amazing. For the price you really do get bang for your buck.

Room was clean, bed was comfy, wifi was great, staff friendly and helpful, and my favorite the view from the 10th floor!

The Metro is about a two minute walk away which will easily get you around the whole city and there is a regular shuttle service to and from the airport.",5,2014,08,24
30,Loved every minute.,"Stayed here for a short sightseeing holiday and was blown away by the room. Me and my fianc√© booked a standard room but I am sure we were upgraded as our room was on the 23rd floor and I‚Äôm sure I read some were that they were executive rooms on this floor so I was really impressed. We arrived late and check in was really quick which after a late flight and a train ride was well appreciated. We walked into the room and was just blown away the view of Barcelona it was at night so was even more beautiful. The room had two televisons a lounge area with a kettle tea coffee and water. There were a few nice magazines to read about things to do there and tips Very helpful. The bedroom was separated by a partition of the two televisions lovely nice comfy king size bed. Sheets all clean and freshly made each day. The bath room was splendid. We had a Jacuzzi bath a large power jet shower and a toilet with its own door. Our safe was great as you make your own code. We left it unlocked by accident on our first day out and I was panicking because I read a review about a ladies gold ear rings going missing. Everything was still there nothing had been touched which I was so glad about. On our first night back we received a lovely desert and a bottle of water free from the hotel which was a nice surprise and they also have shuttle services to the beach and airport which was great. The service in all was brilliant.

The only thing I think others would be disappointed about would maybe be the location but me and my fianc√© went for this hotel because of the location and the prices shoot down as soon as you leave the centre there was a nice little square just to the side of the hotel with a cafe kebab shop and a food shop was all well priced and nice service.

I would definitely recommend a stay here.",5,2014,08,21
30,Struck Gold Staying Here,Hotel was pure class. Was blown away by not just the room but the view of the city. Staff were very helpful and even got a supra chocolate cake on our first night. Bathroom was spectacular really made it feel like home. People may not like the location but it gets you away from the busy noises from the centre and gives you a chance to experience real Barcelona. Plus there is a metro station right outside. By the way the complimentary bus to the airport was very helpful.,5,2014,08,18
30,13 days living there and no complaints,We had to stay on this hotel for a long time due to a delay on our business schedule. Although it's a bit far from town it's not that much if you are driving. There is parking for Euro 18 as well. The area is completely unappealing and you need to go somewhere else to find any touristic or business interest.  Rooms are spacious and some of them have an amazing city and sea view. Bedding it's premium and bathrooms and cabinetry are very nice and functional. Some of the staff are very professional and some other has no clue...not a good thing for a 5*. In overall good experience. Recommendable.,4,2014,08,16
30,Don't expect to get what you pay for,"Reserved and paid for the room 2 months before our trip - the standard room with a king bed, even have the printed receipt but when we arrived low and behold there are on rooms with twin beds and we can upgrade to a king suite for only 50 euros more! 
Still waiting to see how this pans out",3,2014,08,16
30,Excellent Customer service,"For business reasons I have been in this hotel very often. First stay was very nice, rooms good and the foyer vey striking, specially at night. I have been in other hotels around Barcecelona, Melia, Barelona, better located in terms of sightseeing but none actually achieves Hesperia level of customer service. So the next time I went to Barcelona I stayed again in Hesperia and boy was i right! Stayed in a suite, tahat comes with huge bathroom, 2 toilets, sitting room and a separate room and acess to Club level in 5 floor where you can have different rooms for meetings and drink all day and eat something. the display is not big but sufficient after a day of sightseeing and always Cava available :) The hotel is close to the airport, only 10 minutes by taxi, around 17Euros, or they have a schedule transfer.  I have eaten in Restaurant in 29th floor but rather have the Bouquet restaurant at 2nd floor, which is consistently good and surprised every time. Special thanks to the portuguese ladies thar remenber me every time I stayed there and my preferences and said Hello by my name! I ususally stay in hotels every week and this is very rare to happen ...and not difficult at all. and the the hotel thanked me twice by bringing Cava and strawberry to my room once and then a chocolate cake! Thankyou so much.",5,2014,08,16
30,Let down by customer service,"The hotel is a bit out of town, but well connected. Always taxis available and it's 15-20 euros one way.

We were let down by the service. Booked a non smoking king room, but we were told there were none available so we had the choice of a smoking king or a twin room or PAYING an extra 44 euros a night to upgrade to the next room type...

Gym is an extra 14 euros a day which is crazy.

Rooms are fine, bathroom is nice. Beds are cheap and roll around but comfortable enough.

",3,2014,08,16
30,Well placed and comfortable,"We spent a total of two nights here - one before and one after our cruise.  The hotel was ideally situated for our needs, just about halfway between the airport and cruise port.  On each of our stays the hotel staff was very polite, professional and accommodating.  The only issue  we had was I thought the breakfast was a little over priced for what was offered.",4,2014,08,12
30,Lovely business hotel,"We stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The room was lovely and the staff were friendly.  The hotel was pretty modern.  There isn't anything to do in the surrounding area and it is a good half an hour trip into central Barcelona on the tube but the tube station is across the road so its easy and cheap enough to do this every day.  

The room was lovely but I was disappointed that there was a charge to use the gym which is attached to the hotel.  We also ate in the restaurant.  We had the set menu which tasted great but the service was a little slow.  We had the impression that they were short-staffed.",4,2014,08,11
30,Nice modern hotel,"I spent 3 nights at this hotel, I was there for business, my company had an event not far from this place (Fira de Barcelona), although not at a walking distance...
Like others I thought it was very convenient to have taxis around at all time, and other public transportation is at a walking distance.
I liked the modern style, although I would have liked a desk to be able to work comfortably in my room (that was probably the biggest concern from my side).
Other than that, personnel was helpful and nice.",5,2014,08,11
30,Nice but needs work doing to it,"Was once 5 star, but that was in the 2000's and it's not seen any maintenance since. Carpets were fraying, wires were on show from the television,  shower was rubbish,  the red carpet at the entrance was filthy,  reception hadn't been hovered in ages! These shouldn't be the case for a 5 star hotel!",3,2014,08,10
30,Excellent choice,"We originally stayed here for the shuttle service to and from the airport but if your flight is before 7am it is not possible to take advantage of this service. The plus is there is always taxis sitting outside 24/7. The shuttle service to the beach is a plus but it is first come first serve. The metro stop is right across from the hotel to use to get to the center. The rooms were amazing especially the spacious bathroom. The most memorable is the restaurant and the restaurant staff. The food was delicious, you cannot stay without eating here. ",4,2014,08,10
30,5 star hotel in 1 star location and a non-complementary gym,The hotel can justify it's 5 stars if all I look at are the lobby and room. But that's not the full picture is it now. I cannot give more than 3 stars because the hotel is located in a ghetto area at the end of the metro system so it takes about 30 minutes to get to Barcelona downtown. When you taxi from the airport you must pay ‚Ç¨20 eventhough the meter onky reach ‚Ç¨13. The breakfast does not compare well with other 5 star hotels like Casa Fuster where I also stayed on this trip. Last I have to mention that the hotel has no gym or pool. The pool picture the hotel use in their marketing is the a facility in the gym next door. For a fee of ‚Ç¨14 you can use the gym next door. It's an okay gym but you risk that the pool facility is closed like it was when I was there.,3,2014,08,09
30,should update their website,"We spent five nights here and the main reason we chose here was for the luxurious spa. On arrival we were told it was closed for maintenance. This was a big disappointment, on challenging why this,was not shown on their website, we were upgraded to a suite which was lovely, but still didn't make up for missing out on the spa. The trip to the city centre was easy both by metro and taxi, but there is very little nearby.",4,2014,08,09
30,Pleasantly Surprised,"When we booked our stay at the Hesperia Tower I was not sure what to expect being near the airport and at a very reasonable price, We were amazed with the accommodations, level of service, selection of restaurants and quality of food.  We had stayed at the Arts in Barcelona and although the location not as great, everything else was on par and in some instances even better!
The Value experience was Fantastic!",5,2014,08,09
30,"Nice place to stay, but a bit too far away from town","Stylish lobby and nice rooms, but the location is poor. You need to take the metro for 20 mins to get to town, unless you catch the hotel shuttle bus. The food served at the lobby bar/restaurant was pretty dry and not worth the price. The staff was super friendly and we had an enjoyable stay overall. ",4,2014,08,08
30,Great hotel a bit out of town,"If you like to stay in the middle of all the hustle and bustle this hotel is not for you. If you like a luxurious hotel for a good price near the airport and don't mind travelling a bit then this is for you. We arrived in the middle of the night and left very early morning so decided that being close to the airport was the best thing. To get into town you just walk less than 5 min to the subway and take a train for about 20 min, it's very easy and cheap. The hotel is great, big room and a big comfortable bed. The bathrooms/hallway can be a bit daunting as it got mirrors on all walls making it a bit confusing but cool at the same time. Lots of different toiletries are provided. There is a minibar with overpriced drinks but we just took them out and bought our own instead, then put theirs back before we left. We had breakfast one morning and even though it was quite expensive it was worth it. Lots of delicious choices, fruit, bread, eggs, yoghurts, cereals, coffee, tea, juices etc. you name it, they got it.",4,2014,08,08
30,Barcelona - Hesperia Tower,"What a lovely amazing deco hotel, not too far from the central was located in the middle of suburbia few coffee shops, local shops, supermarket nearby.  Local park which we walked through for the metro was a pleasant walk watching the locals go about their daily business.  The Check in was a little slow the receptionist was  not too well informed told us that room was not ready but then the next receptionist said that it was!. We stayed in the adjoining building which was a few minutes away from the main hotel but the suite made up for that,. lovely spacious room with a lounge and small kitchenette very nice almost home :-).  The breakfast was somewhat amazing one of the best I have had, there was absolutely every choice of breakfast stuff you could ever begin to imagine or should I say everything you have imagined! The bar area/ lobby was beautifully furnished with really comfortable sofas, with tv screens, soft lighting it was truly a memorable stay in a beautiful hotel in a vibrant gorgeous city. A fabulous stay highly recommended :-). Oh the location was fine by us it gave us a chance to be away from the hustle bustle and we saw other parts of the city all in all a great break away....oh do take the lift up right to the top you will see the most amazing views...well worth it you will feel exhilarated !!",5,2014,08,06
30,out of town,"we got the hotel as part of a agency deal...as a mystery hotel that you purchase and then you know which one you actually got... so a little like poker...well if was not such a lucky pick!
The hotel itself is nice, modern and at the top in terms of technology... My 9 yr old nerd was thrilled...with the elevators, the switch to open and close the windows and the modern design in general...
This hotel is however a little far away from where the ""action"" is... you can't go out for a bite in the street or go shopping on foot... because there is nothing but a hospital around!
It is close to the airport if you are looking for a night before an early flight...

There is a metro station, in the hospital's parking across the street...and they do offer parking services if you come with your own car...
The food was nice at the bar as well as the restaurant...
The breakfast buffet was also nice with a variety of fresh fruits, spanish dishes and viennoiserie pastry...however, having spend 5 days at the Hilton just before the Hesperia towers, the tables seems a little crowded and we hardly had space the move between the lines of tables to reach ours...
Positive point, the tea selection is amazing with fresh ones that you brew yourself in the fancy cups that have their own sieves!!!",3,2014,08,06
30,Very Nice and comfy hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at the Fira suites, a building kind of adjacent to the main Hesperia Hotel/towers. We had a 1 bedroom suite plus kitchenette and sitting area- very lovely. Bed was nice and comfy.
I find it a bit weird that the Fira suites are not housed in a separate building; they are oddly attached to some kind of office/shops... However, if one doesn't mind the exterior that much, this place is a good deal. 
Note that pretty much all the TV channels are in Spanish only ;)

Food/Dining:
I highly recommend getting a breakfast-inclusive package. We had to walk a couple minutes to the Hesperia Towers to have breakfast, but this wasn't a big deal. The food served at breakfast - buffet style - was one of the best I have eaten at any hotel. Great variety of food, nice waiters who offer you tea/coffee when you walk in, lovely ambiance :)

HOWEVER, if you want to have a nice, relaxing dinner, please do to attempt to visit the BOUQUET restaurant (I believe its on the 14th floor or so of the Hesperia Towers).
My husband and I had a very nasty experience. We had called from our room at the Fira suites and made a dinner reservation for two. On getting there, the host did not make us feel welcome at all! I imagined he felt we won't be able to afford the restaurant, so he told us we had an option of seating at the bistro and having a cheaper meal. We were so appalled. For crying out loud, we had called to to make a reservation for a proper dinner! Anyway, I regret that we did not leave right at that moment. After he gave us 1 menu to stare at and decide if we want to do bistro or main restaurant, he walked away and left us standing by the counter for about 5 mins. Long story short, the food was not commensurate with the amount we paid. The host was quite mechanical throughout out dinner.. at some point, he took our wine glasses off the table just because we hadn't asked for any wine! How rude! Honestly, it was as if he wanted us to just leave. Miserable dinner experience.

The cleaners also misplaced my special pair of socks! I had left them on the bed but didn't find them when I returned later that night. I imagine it must have been wrapped up with the bedsheets and taken out. Although I complained to the staff at the front desk when we were about checking out, I was simply told no one from the cleaning staff had reported any lost/found item from our room. I know its just a pair of socks, but they are special ones and I was a bit disappointed as I got no apology for my lost item :/

In spite of the couple of unsatisfactory experiences mentioned above, I would still recommend this hotel. It is very close to the Metro. There's also a local restaurant - La Flama - not too far away; visit for a nice Spanish meal. A handful of basic shops around as well. We had a free shuttle drop us off at the airport - that was very nice.",4,2014,08,04
30,Convenient luxury,"It is hard to write a review when you stay for free, but I'll do my best. I purchased a room for a night by using soon to expired frequent flyers' miles. We only had to pay for taxes and parking which, surprisingly, was cheaper than the parking we paid for in another, less luxurious, NH hotel in Bilbao. It was convenient for us because we were flying the next morning and the hotel is close to the airport. If you plan to visit Barcelona as a tourist, there are hotels closer to the center of the city. This hotel is for travelers on transit and conventions. The room was well appointed with a fantastic shower system but the decorations were a little gaudy to our taste. Staff was also very helpful. The included breakfast was very good. Surprisingly, the hotel has only one restaurant and, since it is located far from the center of Barcelona, we had to use it. It was a bit expensive, but since it is a 5 star hotel it was to be expected. The food was good, though not exceptional. The service, however,  was first rate.",4,2014,07,31
30,it's just ok,"This is a good hotel, but not impressive. After the death of the chef Santi Santamaria, the restaurant in the tower is closed. Now they just make business events and it's not possible to see it. The present restaurant is quite good and not expensive, but far from the old standards. Room are nice and view is nice. SPA is not included in the price. Not even a bottle of water for free in the room.",3,2014,07,31
30,Good airport location,"Stayed here at the end of a trip in Barcelona and Costa Brava. Actually the best accommodations we had over the course of 10 days, and the least expensive. Check in was a bit slow, and interior of our room was a bit disconcerting--too many mirrors in bath and dressing area, one could easily walk into the walls if jet-lagged or tired. But great bed and linens and large room. Easy and quick taxi into city centre for dinner. Bar was nice for a quick drink, and the breakfast buffet, included, was a nice quick option before an early flight. Hotel has a shuttle to airport, but it's not very frequent, taxi is a better option. Could easily have stayed longer.",4,2014,07,29
30,Very Nice,"The rooms were very nicely appointed, it was quiet, and overall it was a very nice experience.  The shower was a highlight.  It was large, had good water pressure and multiple shower heads.  It was like you were at a spa.  In addition everything was very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  While the hotel is a way out of the city the metro is right across the street and there is a small shopping area with cafes and a market nearby.  My wife and I had a very nice stay and highly recommend this hotel.",4,2014,07,29
30,Great hotel,Great place - Easy metro Access and great shuttle service for the City. Room are spacious and comfortable. Breakfast is very expensive but worth the money. The restaurant Bouquet is  realy good and reasonably priced. And the service In the restaurant is fantastic. Only drawback is the pool Access which is EUR 14. Pitty for a 5 Star hotel where you expect pool Access to be one of the amenities you are already paying for. We would definitely come back.,4,2014,07,27
30,"Out of the City but very classy, and there is a laundromat nearby",We stayed here with our tour and stayed on another night. It is out of the city and there are very few cafes around for eating. The rooms are large- even tough walking through the bathroom to get to the bedroom is unusual. The bathroom is covered with mirrors and so tricky to navigate at times. The beds are really comfortable. The room was very clean also. The pool is not free- 14 euro. It would have been nice if one side of the wardrobe had had large shelves in it so that we could have unpacked our suitcases more easily- bit of wasted room really. The staff at the desk were excellent- always helpful and English was good. There is a laundromat nearby- go out of the hotel and turn left and walk around the building alongside the gym entrance. Walk through the park (there is a dog-leg to the left). When you get to the road take the pedestrian crossing straight ahead of you and you will see the laundromat straight ahead next to the Pizza shop. We had a good experience here. Free printing also.,4,2014,07,23
30,lovely overall,"ten min from airport, 2 min from underground. hotel is lovely inside n out, though possibly a year or two from tidy up, though by no means in bad condition, staff excellent, food is lovely, dont let industrial sort of area put you off in anyway, not a minus or a plus",4,2014,07,22
30,Hesperia Tower,"Fabulous place for an overnight stop, Hotel was clean, comfortable, and beautiful.
Room service and the restaurant was amazing, the food was delicious and service very helpful.
The building was what we really wanted to see, it has architectural interest to us and didnt disappoint.",5,2014,07,16
30,Beautiful hotel,"We booked this hotel because it was close to the airport, it was a little bit of a drive (about 15 minutes by cab) from the centre of town and where all the restaurants and sights are, but it was worth it. The hotel added to the great time we had in Barcelona and the modern architecture is a pleasure to stay in.",5,2014,07,12
30,Lovely hotel,"Stayed for what should have been 4 nights but ended up being 3 as was unable to get to the hotel the first night due to its location, as there was no public transport available after certain hours.  A taxi from Girona airport would have been in excess of ¬£100 so it was cheaper to stay at the airport for the first night.  Travelled with my daughter and it was her birthday and even though I had informed the hotel of this beforehand there was no mention of it.  

The hotel itself is beautiful and the decor can't be faulted, in my opinion.  It is very clean throughout and plenty of space to sit and relax.  I do feel, however, that the hotel is let down by the Reception staff (not including the male staff who were all very helpful).  We had an early bus to catch on our departure and due to the hotel location meant it would be an half hour journey to the station.  When I enquired at reception about the metro hours I was told that it didn't operate until 7am, however, by chance I checked online and discovered that it actually starts operating at 5am.  

Our room was perfectly adequate even though I am presuming it was a standard twin/double - the bathroom was fab although I did find it a bit strange that the wardrobe is situated in the bathroom.  The beds were  comfortable and there was a mini fridge in the room but it wasn't actually working.  The only complaint is the fact that there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room whatsoever.  I do like a cup of coffee in the mornings and found it ridiculous that I had to walk to a nearby patisserie to get this unless I wanted to pay 3.5 euro at hotel prices!

The location - YES, it is a fair distance from Barcelona centre (half hour metro ride) but as the metro station is very close to the hotel this wasn't a hindrance at all.  We bought a 3 day metro ticket which was 20 euros and this served us for all our journeys throughout our stay.

Contrary to what previous reviews have said, there are a couple of small supermarkets, a patisserie and a coffee shop that sells fresh  baguettes within easy walking distance (5 mins) and a kebab shop which sells drinks also, with an outdoor seating area.  These are to the right of the hotel when you exit and right again, and just keep walking.  

The prices in the hotel are costly for most things - e.g. two cocktails 22 euros but, having said that, most hotels charge the same nowadays.  

All in all we had a great few days and I would definitely use this hotel again if ever I were to return to Barcelona and hopefully the reception staff would be better by that time.",4,2014,07,11
30,Nice and friendly,"I spent 5 nights with my boyfriend at this hotel. We are both students, but we could still afford it. The room was clean and looked new, the spa was although not as big as we could have hoped for - but all in all we had a great stay at Hesperia Tower Hotel. ",5,2014,07,10
30,"Great room, not so great location","On the very positive side the room that I had was great with a lounge, good sized bedroom and a walk in wardrobe that my wife would die for.  The hotel is large and there are excellent views from the upper floors although the lift system doesn't cope well during the ""rush hour"".  I was forced on a couple of occasions to use the stairs from the 12th floor - a great alternative to the gym!  Food and service were acceptable although food is a bit on the expensive side.  On the negative side is the location.  Whilst it's good for Barcelona airport, (there is a shuttle and the taxi journey is 15 minutes and approximately 120 Euros) it's in an island of busy roads, light industry and 1970""s apartments.  I found nowhere for a nice walk or attractive bar/restaurant in the immediate area.  I would recommend for a night if you are using the airport.",3,2014,07,10
30,Rooms top quality service lacks travel abit long,"Stayed as a couple end of June for 3 nights in a duplex suite
Weather very nice all weekend 27 cel all weekend.
The room Duplex suite was on the top (25 floor) it had a toilet sitting tv area and dining table downstairs with large window then upstairs jaquzzi overlooking the city, another tv, an ipod docking station- but only with iphone4 so if you have iphone 5 or ipad mini like ourselves don't bother, bed, another toilet and shower. Bed was huge! With 2 different types of pillow. BVGLARI toiletries provided but no bubble bath! :( but toothbrush shaving stuff etc and loads of towels provided! Hairdryer also with a nice make up zoom mirror. Room was looking abit old carpet had a few stains and electric blinds had rips. Mini bar expensive 8euro for mini tiny bottle of spirit 6euro for soft drink. Room was very clean provided 4 dressing robes 2-towel sort 2- fluffy and some basic slippers. Bottles of water provided. Shower had 2 separate jets and blinds all electronic. Safe provided in room. Walls were very very thin you could hear everything from the next room to bedroom antics to the electric blinds closing to just conversations, loud at night!
This room entitled us to use 'tower club' which was sort of a lounge area with tv food drink etc. However it lacked it had Nespresso machine and teas a toaster, range of cereal juices water soft drink, Heineken and spirits available free in the area. The food lacked. The area is beautiful with lovely chairs and sofas, flowers but lacks atmosphere- soft background music better food? For breakfast there's a range of hams some sticky croissants then for lunch and dinner some nuts and marshmallows come out along with 1 red 1 white and 1 prosecco- a lot of potential but the area is disappointing, no staff attends to the area for hours on end, service and quality isn't 5 star.
Also with this room we were entitled to use gym and spa which was on separate area but flip flop and a swimming cap had to be worn in the area which we didn't really fancy.

Theres nothing really around the hotel to walk around- restaurant corner shops nice walking area. So you need to go into the centre every time you want to do something.
Cab airport > hotel 30 euro 10 mins
hotel> airport 20 euro 10 mins
hotel> city centre 17 euro 10 mins
The metro is a 5 minute walk from the hotel and takes 30 mins to take you to the city centre (catalunya stop) for 2.40 euro one way or pay 10 euro for 5 trips, ticket machines very easy to use can be translated to English. Trains AC loads of vending machines everywhere.
To be honest this journey was okay but doing it every day twice a day was too much. In the day we found we wanted to come back to the hotel for rest or nap at around 5 after spending the day in town and come back into town for dinner but we wouldn't as was too much of a journey. So in this aspect we felt the hotel was too far from the city centre.
When in the city centre we paid 35euro each for a 2 day tourist bus ticket which took us all over Barcelona which maps and guides. This ticket for the bus can be purchased at the hotel or just in the city at one of the stands. The best stops to visit - the cable car up to the castle, the port, magical fountains (best to see in evening for light show) but day time just as good, the rambla of course and food market.

The service and the staff at the hotel we felt were poor. Their English was very good however they seemed to be in training and lacked knowledge of the hotel. We called reception several times and got different answers every time about basic questions regarding the pool or the restaurants. At one point one lady was adamant we had to pay for the pool even though we were in a suite after 10 minutes she called back with a different answer. We planned to eat at the hotel  but when visiting the Bouquet restaurant the Host at the front was very very rude and found him arrogant put of us eating there then after looking at the menu we decided they lacked choice with very few options just on 1 small page and all 25 euro plus for 1 dish. Room service also lacked and very expensive eg.5 euro for cereal, 5 euro for cup of tea (tea and coffee provided in room however if you run out and need more 8 euro charged). The staff around the hotel didn't seem to want to engage in conversation, help us or even be friendly. Service was 2 star at the least. Also the hotel team and management was aware of a celebration of a birthday and a lot of emails were transferred to make the day special, however the celebration wasn't even acknowledged or anything special done a dessert, just saying happy birthday at check in or a note would of been nice after the emails transferred stated we could arrange chocolate strawberries and champagne- this was disappointing and they could of gone the extra mile.

All together a lot of wasted potential at this hotel they have the design and facilities but lack small things and customer service.",4,2014,07,05
30,Lovely hotel and most of the staff helpful,"We were in 
Barcelona for three nights for my husband's birthday and to celebrate our anniversary and we stayed at the Hesperia Tower Hotel. Check in and out is a quick transaction and staff are good at giving you advice on how to get about. The hotel itself is extremely nice with a lovely red carpet entrance and extravagant lobby area. Our room was very spacious, queen-size bed and lovely bathroom. We were disappointed to find there was no tea making facilities in the room which I would have expected from a 5* hotel. When we asked we were told they don't provide. So you can't have tea after a longday out. The hotel is a bit of a way from the Centre (20mins on the Metro) but the Metro runs every 5 mins and is a 5 minute walk from the hotel so this wasn't a problem. As for breakfast we paid for two only to get there @11am and we were not allowed in as they closed at 11am which is understandable. Staff there  recommended we go ask from reception for our breakfast to be brought to our room. We explained to the reception staff that we got there at 11am and we were leaving next day was there a chance we could have breakfast in our room as suggested by their colleague however all he did was to give our cash backüò•üò•üò•üò•üò•. It's a nice hotel I could recommend it  to anyone however have to pay for any extras. There are no shops or restaurant  around we had to pay ‚Ç¨20 to the nearest mal to buy nibbles for a late night. Thanks to staff they made my hubby a cake which was nice of them. 
It's a place I can definite use again though I think some of their facilities are a bit dear.",4,2014,07,04
30,"Very Nice, Perimeter Location","Modern hotel next to college and hospital complex. Stayed for a business convention. Upscale rooms with dark decor theme, large showers, dressing area, comfortable slightly firm beds, a few design quirks here and there. Showers can run hot and cold. Restaurant food and service were good. Fitness club has reasonable workout equipment, adjacent to hotel and requires daily E14 fee, sandals and swim cap for pool and is age restricted. Elevators were unable to keep up with demand when hotel was full. Nice place to stay, very close to airport but not particularly close to city center. Metro stop is 5 minute walk but takes roughly 30 minutes to reach center destinations. Not much of anything within walking distance. Taxis always available at door. Overall I would stay here again for meetings at the hotel but elsewhere for tourist agenda.",4,2014,07,01
30,Nice after cruise stay near airport.,"Stayed here one night after a cruise, So we could tour Barcelona. Very nice upscale hotel with friendly helpful staff.  Our stay was on a Sunday so only one of the three restaurants was open. However it was very, very good!  Nice views from the room, could see the airport but was still a ‚Ç¨25 cab ride to the terminal. Our room had a full body shower, only Spanish tv ( go figure) and Dont forget your electrical adapters.  Would definitely stay their again.",4,2014,06,30
30,Definitely NOT 5-star!,"I would describe the hotel as a mix of excellent one minute and surprisingly floppy the next. We stayed in the ""Fira Suites"" part of the hotel, which is not in the main tower but in the small building nearby. The overall impression is that the hotel management is learning the art of 5-star service while trying to be thrifty on every little thing. To their credit, they definitely got some things right. The hotel features a cool ambiance with artfully implemented contemporary design and quiet lounge music playing in the background in the lobby area and in the restaurants. The rooms are clean and spacious with big windows. The floors (ceramic tile everywhere including the room) are spotless. The staff are very polite and helpful. The food is fantastic! My warmest compliments to the chef. However, our ""view"" was of the backside structures. Our shower door didn't close tightly. The pedal on our bathroom trash can didn't work. In the corridors I noticed peeling paint. Our small kitchen had no kitchen towels or dish detergent provided. Shampoo didn't come in cute-looking plastic bottles, the way you would expect of a 5-star hotel, but instead in packets you had to rip open like those in a cheap motel. The room rate (which looked very reasonable at the moment of booking) didn't include breakfast or swimming pool or exercise facility or parking. All of that is extra (and a lot), which you don't realize until you check in. Now, the location of the property deserves special discussion. We rented a car so didn't have to use the hotel shuttle bus. But we did try to find a place to eat and to buy groceries nearby and the nearest grocery store is either a 30-minute walk or a 45-minute car ride (I'm counting the time you spend looking for a parking spot). Almost same (a bit better) goes for eating locations. Unless you love walking (which luckily we do) you're pretty much confined to the restaurants in the hotel, which serve amazing food but at a premium price. The ""15 minutes from downtown"" tale is simply not true unless you take the hotel bus I guess, but that means your timing can't be flexible. The center of Barcelona is a good 40-minute ride by metro (parking there is difficult and expensive). In fact the hotel is located at the terminal metro station, pretty much as far from the city center as it gets. The overall area of the hotel's location looks somewhat run-down and I would be uncomfortable walking there by myself after dark. Little things, one would say, but they add up. My overall experience was not bad due to a lot of good elements of service mentioned earlier. But it was definitely a negative surprise relative to my ""5-star"" - conditioned expectations.",3,2014,06,30
30,Very nice,This is a very nice and very modern hotel. The front desk is VERY helpful. Everyone speaks English well.  The dining room is pricey but the food is good.  We took the Metro (subway) everywhere and it was easy.  Much cheaper than taxis!,4,2014,06,30
30,Nice,Very nice place.A lot of modern facilities.Easy access to airport.I would suggest taking the plan which includes breakfast.Bus takes you to airport or downtown at different intervals.Bus driver Carmen very helpful.I would recommend to fiends and family.,5,2014,06,29
30,Good stay,"I arrived to Barcelona with my family and had a great time at this hotel. swimming pool area was 14 Euro extra which I thought it should of been within the hotel price and not extra. 

Room was very nice.
View was very nice from window.
Lounge area was very good and chilled out.
Was PRICEY but what can you do these days, everything is becoming expensive!
Swimming pool, Sauna and steam room area was very nice.
Staff are helpful.
Internet connection WASN'T great.",4,2014,06,23
30,Hesperia Tower,"Hotel is off the beaten path the cost is approx. 30 euro via taxi to get into town.  Use of the pool is an additional charge  The staff are very courteous.
Shuttle service is very limited confirm B4 U go.",4,2014,06,11
30,Restaurante Bouquet in Hesperia Tower,"We came to Barcelona on a 6AM flight from Palermo via Rome and with all the transfers, we had not eaten anything since the previous evening and were starving when we checked into the Hesperia Tower just after noon. Since we were too enervated to take the metro into central Barcelona for food, we thought we'd try the Bouquet Restaurant in the Hesperia Tower where we were staying. We were concerned that the prices were high (20+ euros per dish) and that we might get ""hotel restaurant food"" or nouvelle cuisine portions. However, we discovered a 25 euro pp. prix fixe menu and decided to give it a shot. Wow! This was one of the best meals we have ever had--cherry gazpacho, chicken breast stuffed with mushrooms, spinach, and raisins, and coffee/chocolate dessert with mandarin sauce. The bread (olive and tomato were two of the choices) was also served with miniature bottles of olive oil and a dish of fleur de sel and the meal began with delightful marcona almonds. Portions were just right--enough to sate our hunger for sure. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. This meal was classic gourmet Barcelona.",5,2014,06,06
30,"Good service, great views, slightly misleading advertising","Lovely hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, the only problems we had was firstly the pictures on the advert which we paid for were for an upgraded priced room, which they offered us when we got there for 60 euro per night. A slight disappointment. Secondly our room didnt have a double bed but rather two singles lined up that would separate when we were on them. They did change our room for us the second night though as they didnt have anything the first night. The breakfast buffet is a massive two thumbs up and worth every penny, beautiful chilled ambience, great selection of foods done well. shuttle service had left as our plane was late but the bus drops you directly outside for chump change, so no inconvenience there at all. the views are second to none with floor to ceiling windows as a major highlight for this remarkable hotel. 

Barcelona is a stand out place in general so I would absolutely return there and budget for a better room at the same hotel.",4,2014,06,04
30,"Good, but not 5*","Room is ok. Shower switches from cold water to hot. Really impossible to balance. The lobby seems a bit packed. Too many furniture. Good breakfast. Nice conference rooms.

Could be a good choice if traveling on leisure.

30,Hesperia Tower - Barcelona,"fantastic hotel, beautiful rooms and very accommodating.  Very friendly staff and great conference facilities.  Quite far out of city centre, but very near to metro station, which is very easy to use.  This hotel suited our business and family needs, they also provided a free shuttle service to the airport.
HOWEVER......... this hotel advertises that they have pool and leisure facilities....... THEY DON'T... there are these facilities located next door and you can use them if you are staying at the hotel, they charge 16 euros per person, per day, you have to wear flip flops and no children under 16 are allowed!!!  My 13 year old daughter was gutted.
Overall. a lovely place to stay.",4,2014,06,03
30,Amazing Hotel,"I stayed here with my boyfriend over the bank holiday weekend, we got a standard room and were told that we could upgrade to a suite for ‚Ç¨40 per night which is nothing really. The standard room was beautiful, but after about half an hour we decided to go ahead with the upgrade.

The suite was amazing, we had a sitting room with a dining table, two bathrooms, a walk in wardrobe, separate jacuzzi bath and raindrop/power shower which were filled with Bvkgari products.

The hotel itself is so stylish, it has a real modern, chic feel and the staff are really helpful, ordering us taxi's when we needed them, suggesting what we should do whilst we were there. 

The breakfast wasn't included but it was around ‚Ç¨20 each per day, which I wouldn't have every day, but it was lovely to have once. They do everything: fruit, jelly (yes jelly for breakfast!) yoghurts, cereals, salads, cheese, juices, cakes, pastry's and of course everything you need for a full English. It was just lush!

All in all it was an amazing stay, I really did get sad when we had to leave. The only thing that I would say that they need to improve on is the shuttle service into town - it was free as stated, but there weren't that many times that you could use it, and the last shuttle back to the hotel was quite early; this put our taxi budget up quite a bit, especially at night when they are using the night rate fare.",5,2014,06,02
30,"Location so so, but hotel is great","I've been here for a business trip and a conference - quality of the rooms, hotel itself, food is great. I haven't tried the SPA though.

Be aware that the location is not the nicest one - I wouldn't go walking around, just grab a taxi or metro and go to the city.",5,2014,06,02
30,Mother daughter trip to spain! Business/Family,"Loved this hotel! The staff was very friendly to both my business needs and family ones. The shuttle service they offer is excellent and right on time! Not only do they offer shuttle service from the airport which was a nice 30 euro save, but also to the center of the city! Taking the metro to and from is beyond amazing and extremely easy! The staff was very prompt to answer to all of our needs and helpful if we ever forgot anything! Loved this hotel and it is a must next time I visit Barcelona!",5,2014,06,02
30,"Good hotel, bit out of the way, watch out for price of ""extras""","WARNING ABOUT THE POOL FACILITIES AT THIS HOTEL!
The hotel advertises that they have a pool.
This is not strictly true! It is a sports facility which you can use if you are staying in the hotel, WITH THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS:
- cost of using the pool is 16euros per person per day (!)
- you must wear flip-flops and a swimming cap (!!)
- no children under 16 allowed in the pool (!!!)
END OF WARNING

We stayed at the Hesperia Tower Barcelona in April 2014 for 1 night on a short city break.

The hotel is approx 20 mins ride/30 euros taxi ride from El Prat airport, 20 mins/25 euros taxi ride form Barcelona city centre, and is about 20 minutes Metro ride from Barcelona city centre. The Metro line is about 5 minutes walk away from the hotel - it is not very well sign posted, but basically follow everyone else heading towards it!

The hotel is a fabulous modern building - it looks like something from Thunderbirds, to be honest! The foyer/reception is huge, plenty of chair/seats/bars. Check-in staff were polite, friendly, and spoke good English.

The room was HUGE - a massive double room, a connecting room/corridor, and a VAST bathroom - fantastic! Everything obviously new and modern. Room was well furnished, clean and comfortable. Absolutely no complaints about the room - FANTASTIC! Bed and sleep quality excellent. Good quality complimentary toiletries, a modern styled bathroom, shower AND bath - and everything was clean and tidy, with everything working! Plenty of lovely thick clean towels - WELL DONE! 

TV was digital, good size, decent range of channels, plugins for your i-pod! Fantastic! WI-FI FREE, fast and reliable - WELL DONE! Marriot, take note!!

Superb views from the room, and we also recommend taking the outside lift to the very top floor!

Now for the grizzles - very minor ones:
- the hotel is in the middle of no where - no cafes, bars, nothing. That wasn't a problem as we didn't mind using the Metro to get in and out of town
- price of food, not bad but not great either - we just took the Metro into Barca and ate there instead!

Checkout out was fast and efficient. There was a free shuttle from the hotel to El Prat airport, but it only runs 3 times a day and the times it ran did not fit in with our plane.

As a one-night stay to get to the airport, absolutely fine. However, as a base to visit Barca - maybe a bit too far out? If you don't mind a 20 minute Metro trip in and back, then this may be a very good option for as a base, as long as you realise that there is NOTHING else in the vicinity of the hotel.

On the whole, I can recommend this hotel.

PROS
Friendly staff
HUGE comfy clean rooms
Good sleep quality
FREE WI-FI

CONS
Economical with the availability and cost of the ""pool""
Location - middle of nowhere
Cost of food",4,2014,05,31
30,An Amazing Experience,"My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend in Barcelona.  Upon our arrival we were greeted by friendly and helpful staff.  We were able to check in immediately and get up to our room to relax.  Once we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity of space.  We decided to splurge a little and stayed in a suite.  It was more than worth it!  There was a living room space separate from the bedroom area (both with large flat screen tvs) and there was a HUGE closet/dressing area along with two separate toilets and a GIANT shower and spa tub.  Needless to say, you get what you pay for with this.  The bed was comfortable and provided a wonderful nights sleep.  The view was spectacular, overlooking the edges of the city and the sea.  On top of all of this, we were provided a ""treat"" our first night with some tasty sweets.  We also had access to the ""Tower Club"" where we could enjoy free snacks and drinks (alcohol included) throughout the day.  This included a continental breakfast, wine, liquor, champagne, beer, sweets, and other snacks/drinks.  Again, this was worth every penny that we spent.
As far as getting around the city, it will take some time.  There is a metro station just a 5 minute walk away.  But it is about a 20 minute subway ride to get into the city and bit longer to get to some of the main attractions.  With the Barcelona Pass it's easy to get around and we only spent 20 euros each on transport for the three days we were there.  And with that said, I think it is well worth it for the quality of the hotel and the staff.  If I could do it again I would do it just the same.
The hotel is very close to the airport and they offer a free shuttle at various times throughout the day.  Our travel times didn't fit that schedule but it was just a quick bus ride there and an easy 20 euro cab ride back at the end of our trip (which the hotel set up for us).
I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking at a stay in Barcelona.  You won't be disappointed!",5,2014,05,27
30,Enjoyed the stay.,"Rooms were excellent, hotel itself was beautiful.  The location is not great.  There are not any good restaurants within walking distance but there is a small grocery store, a cafe, and a couple of bars nearby.  The park behind the hotel is nice.  The walk to the hotel isn't bad, maybe 5 to 7 minutes, but be sure to take the hospital stop on the metro (the last stop on the red line).",4,2014,05,27
30,"Lovely hotel, shame about the service","We have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona, staying at the Hesperia Tower Hotel. The hotel itself is extremely nice with a lovely red carpet entrance and extravagant lobby area. Our room was very spacious, queen-size bed and lovely bathroom.  We were disappointed to find there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which I would have expected from a 5* hotel.  The hotel is a bit of a way from the Centre (20mins on the Metro) but the Metro runs every 5 mins and is a 5 minute walk from the hotel so this wasn't too much of a problem.
Breakfast the following morning was a bit of a let down.  When we arrived at the restaurant we were shown to a table and asked if we wanted orange juice, tea or coffee.  My husband said yes please.  The waiter then said which one to which we replied all three.  We both wanted orange juice, I drink coffee and my husband drinks tea.  The waiter seemed a little took back by our reply but off he went and returned 5 mins later with the orange juice.  The coffee turned up a few minutes after that and then the tea arrived.  My husband had to then go looking for a member of staff to ask for milk and sugar.  When we went to get our breakfast they had run out of scrambed eggs and fried eggs.  We waited for them to be replenished which took 10 minutes and by which time the rest of our breakfast had gone cold.  We felt the service in the restaurant was not very good at all and it really spoilt the start of our day. There was no improvement on breakfast the following day either and we had paid 16Euros each for it.
We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening so can't say whether the service was any better.  This is a lovely hotel its just a shame you don't get 5* treatment.",4,2014,05,27
30,Enjoying Barcelona from a distance,"Fira suites: A great stay in Barcelona for business reasons... True, the hotel is a bit far away from the city, but when you have been in Barcelona a few times, this Hesperia Tower is an oasis of rest in the sea of hectic city life. Good price. Simple math learns that a 12 Euro txi ride twice a day + the low rate of the hotel beats many higher price hotels in the city centre. Even better, a 2 euro metro ride economizes even better. Pretty hard to beat and clean and comfortable rooms. Good reachability from the airport is another big +
Breakfast a bit overpriced as in many hotels (understatement). Should change as a world wide business practice in many business hotels",4,2014,05,26
30,Lovely stay!!,"I'm a vert picky person but I certainly loved this hotel! My partner took me for my 20th birthday and even he said if he went to Barcelona again he'd stay in this hotel. They provided me with a free birthday cake, the staff were very polite! We also had a misunderstanding when the room cleaners took our bottle of Mo√´t that we bought out of the hotel that was finished because they thought we was done with but we called them and told them and without any fuss they gave us one back. The bathroom is beautiful, if you love to look at yourself you'd definitely be in there all day LOL! It's so easy to get into town, it's a 2min walk to the metro and you can get a train straight there which is roughly 15mins but me and my partner found a short cut and it took us about 10. The downfall is the hotel should let you know before hand that you have to pay to use the spa facilities but besides that it's a lovely hotel and I would have stayed longer if could!",5,2014,05,25
30,Mixed feelings about this 5 star hotel,"Starting with the good bits.  Great staff and stylish and modern rooms. Wonderful breakfast and spectacular views over Barcelona.  We ate in the hotel restaurant on Friday night. Set menu for 25 euro which was very cheap given the quality of the food. 

Not so good
We had chosen the hotel outside of Barcelona because of the spa. Tried to find out how to book treatments and nothing on website.  Had an online chat with NH to get info and was told they didn't have any and to email the hotel where I would get a prompt response. On our way back from our trip and still no response. When we arrived we went straight to the spa to book and only 2 slots left and at different times. We explained what a pain it had been and they explained it was a separate business and the communication between the two was terrible. If you advertise the spa as being part of the hotel is should function much better than it did. 
Had a couple of tea bags, 2 pots of milk and a kettle in the room which was great.   However to get more tea bags and pots of milk for day 2 was 8 euro! 5 star hotel thst is stingy with the cheapest of things is not 5 star. ",4,2014,05,18
30,First class with breathtaking view,"An exceptional hotel. Perfect reception, the room on two levels with a view on the city gives a good impression. The personnel is kind and efficient. Perfect breakfast and good lunch. For a newsmaniac you have a selection of Spanish, UK and US newspapers. The hotel is a bit far from the city centre, but close to the airport.",5,2014,05,14
30,Very nice hotel,"A very nice hotel. Very modern. Hotel room very comfortable and big. Good breakfast. I would have given 5 stars, but location is less, therefore i have given 4 stars. Although, metro to go into center is close by.",4,2014,05,10
30,Fantastic hotel - right next to the metro ,This hotel is just a short distance from the airport. It is a bit out of the city centre but about a 2 min walk from a metro station. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Would improve hotel if pool was free to guests. ,5,2014,05,06
30,Nice hotel close to metro,"Hotel was very nice, staff very friendly, we upgraded to junior suit on the 24th floor for ‚Ç¨35 which was well worth it as we had our own Jacuzzi and two huge LED tv's

Metro station is across the road, 2min walk.  

Room and bathroom were nice and clean. Hotel lobby was very nice.

Will stay again",5,2014,05,06
30,Very good hotel,"We stayed at this hotel this weekend 2/5 4/5
I can only say very good the room was a good size very clean the only thing the fridge was not working, but saying that if we had called to advise of this I am sure it would of been looked in to.
The service was very good including the bar staff did have some very nice cocktails.
Would recommend to anyone great place to stay very close to buses or the metro plus taxi out side the hotel at all times.",5,2014,05,05
30,Location is not great but Hotel is very good..,"I use this hotel as it is the best close to the airport and reasonably priced.  Outside and location wise the hotel is plain, but inside, and the rooms is very good.

Staff are friendly (the check in is a little slow due to form filling and they didn't have me in the system from my last trips, so could improve) and helpful.

My wife and I had one days business in Barcelona before flying to Madrid (see next review), so we stayed close to the hotel.  The cafe and dining was great and again star we attentive and friendly...quite chatty and connected.

Would stay here again, solo or with colleagues or my wife.",4,2014,04,28
30,Fantastic hotel,"I don't normally write reviews for hotels but I shall make an exception here. I brought my girlfriend for her birthday and we loved it, service and facilities are excellent and they operate a shuttle into the city and airport. They also left a surprise birthday cake in our room which was a wonderful touch. Could not recommend the place highly enough! Fantastic ",5,2014,04,28
30,Amazing,"The hotel is pretty much half way between the airport and all the action in Barcelona. Some would say it is quite out of the way but the easy public transport access on bus/tube more than makes up for that; including when you are venturing out into Barcelona by night. (On weekends, the tube runs all night!)

Anyway, the hotel is very modern and chic as well as quite flashy and trendy. The rooms were large with high ceilings along with equally large windows that extended from the floor to the ceiling. Luckily for us, our room was quite high up and facing the city of Barcelona and we really enjoyed the view out of those windows at night. You get a clear view of the Camp Nou stadium (during the day) in the distance along with the bright lights of the city skyline and Olympic Park by night. 

Other than that, the beds were ridiculously comfortable and the room was fully enjoyed as we made more use of the iPod dock than the TV. The bathroom as well was modern and kitted out in all-black tiles with a very big shower. In terms of food, breakfast and dinner was thoroughly enjoyed! (along with the surprise Birthday treats that were sent up to the room for my Sister).

The only major downside about our stay at the Hesperia was that we were disappointed that the fitness and pool required a hefty additional fee. It was quite the buzz kill. But other than that, I would recommend this hotel to anyone during their stay in Barcelona. If people are craving a swim, just do like we did and hit the beach!",4,2014,04,24
30,Excellent hotel for visiting the city of Barcelona,"I booked a 3 night break in April to celebrate my sons 21st Birthday.
My family had a great time at this fab hotel , staff very friendly and accommodating even to the point of providing a birthday cake with complimentary drinks , as a total surprise.
The location is just outside the city, which was just what we required and we made use of the free mini bus service available to the city direct from the hotel.
Would highly recommend this hotel and location for visiting the attractions of Barcelona.",5,2014,04,15
30,Best hotel ever!,"I stayed here for 3 nights with a friend. We just wanted a quick break away and got a last minute deal. On arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful member of staff. As check in was not until 3pm and we arrived at 11am, we were not expected to be told that our room was ready for us. After a tiring flight and early start this was great news!

The main reception was very stylish and the lifts were impressive with a special touch screen system that meant the fastest lift would get to you depending on the floor you were on. 

I was amazed when we reached our room. It was stunning. we only booked a standard room but this exceeds any hotel I have stayed in even when I have booked an executive room or suite. The first thing we saw was a beautiful bathroom with twin sinks, a powerful rainfall shower and my favourite thing... a walk in wardrobe complete with robes, slippers and plenty of hanging space and drawers. The toiletries were good quality and plentiful with a little sign saying to ask if we needed anything else. At this point, I was happy not to leave the hotel!

The bedroom was spacious with very comfy beds and a choice of pillows. We had floor to ceiling windows and a desk and dressing table. I enjoyed the view from our window in which I could see planes landing and taking off at the airport. Noise was not an issue, we didn't hear another guest or noise from outside throughout our stay. The air conditioning worked well and although we didn't have room service, the menu looked interesting and varied. 

On our first day, the receptionist gave us a map and highlighted points of interest and how to get there. I have read on here lots of reviews about the hotel being too far away from anything but this was really not a problem at all and I hope others would not be put off from staying at such an exquisite hotel because of this. The metro is about 100 yards away and so easy. There are machines at the entrance showing pictures of 1,2,3 or 4 day travel passes. We picked the 3 day pass. it showed a sign for 20 euros, i put my money in and out it came, no messing. We were the last stop so the metro was always empty when we got on and off and lights flashed on a map to show where you were. This was so much easier and safer than the London tube. Also, Barcelona is so big, even if you stayed in the centre, you would likely have to get a tube to other parts anyway. it took about 15-20 mins to get to Catalunya by metro so no problem at all. 

Breakfast was really good in the morning. 16 euros but you are on your holidays so enjoy and fill your boots!

Also, the pool is not in the hotel but it might as well be because it is literally just the next door along. Because it was 14 euros for the day, we saved this until our last day and planned to spend the day here. I regret this now as it again was a fantastic pool and I wish I had gone every day. Yes you need a swimming cap but only if you plan to swim in the lanes. There is a decent sized pool that is the best in the world where you don't have to wear a cap. It is really hot and it has a ledge under water all the way round with massage jets that blow onto your back and legs. There are also 4 sun beds under water that blow loads of bubbles. It had 3 big fountains that run fast water. You stand under it and it massages your back. If I hadn't have had a flight to catch I would have stayed all day and gone back everyday. 14 euros is nothing compared to how good it was. Finally, the hotel staff let us check out late as our flight was not until 9pm which was really good. 

The only slight downside was we had a massive TV in our room but only 1 English channel but my advice is less TV, more swimming, it is open until 9:30 - 10pm!

Overall, I had an absolutely fantastic time and thank the staff very much. I will definitely return as soon as I can!",5,2014,04,14
30,Severe safety problem,"Had a very unpleasant experience in this hotel a couple of days ago. Another hotel guest suddenly came into my room in the middle of the night. Turned out he had mistaken his room number, went to the hotel reception and they re-programmed his key without checking if it was the correct room number. The hotel didn't even apologise to me when I went down, there is a severe safety problem in this hotel and I will never stay there again. ",1,2014,04,06
30,Excellent business hotel,"Spent 3 nights in the hotel while attending a conference. Excellent location for business, close to the airport. The hotel it located a bit from the center, but no problem going downtown by subway (20 minutes) or taxi (10-15 minutes).

I stayed in a standard double room. The room was spacious and modern with a great view from the 15th floor. Excellent shower (!) and all necessary facilities.

Staff was very service minded and helpful. Breakfast was excellent!

All in all I highly recommend this hotel, especially for business travels.",5,2014,04,04
30,Great hotel but a little far from the city centre.,Stayed here for a couple of days. The hotel is really nice and the staff really polite and helpful. The room was comfortable and definitely great value for money compared to come other hotels I have stayed at in Barcelona. The location is not the best if you are on vacation but the connectivity is great.,5,2014,03,31
30,Good service!,"Been here for a convention. The hotel staff is really very helpfull. Good Wifi connection for free, clean rooms, nicely decorated, very good F&B possibilities, although maybe a bit expensive.
It's not the hotel to visit Barcelona as a tourist due to its location.",4,2014,03,27
30,Nice stay,"Enjoyed a nice 3 night stay for business here recently. Room was great (although the excessive use of mirrors and polished surfaces in the bathroom must cause issues :))
Hotel is perfectly located for the airport (about 10 mins away) and a taxi into downtown only took around 15 mins.
Nothing is included (water etc ) and they charge extra for the gym so bear it in mind.
Food was good.",4,2014,03,24
30,Hotel in Barcelona,"The hotel itself was beautiful.  The employees were helpful.  The room was big, the bathroom was huge and so comfortable.  The metro station is walking distance and it might look a little scary because it dark, but seemed safe enough to me.  The shuttle in the hotel is the only thing I would complain about, I wish it had more different times.
      ",4,2014,03,17
30,Great hotel second visit,"This was my second trip staying at Hesperia Tower and we were not disappointed. Good attentive service from the staff even before we had arrived to assist us with specific requirements for the stay. Do get the shuttle bus timetable it is an excellent service and drops you in the centre of town or to the airport. Rooms are fine clean and sizeable, more importantly comfortable beds.

Oh not to mention decent sized bath towels and facilities for the disabled traveller were good. Lastly we had a special birthday and a lovely cake arrived which was greatly appreciated.",5,2014,03,16
30,Modern stylish hotel,"A very sophisticated and modern hotel covered with Barcelona's style throughout the hotel. Its closer to the airport than the city, therefore quick to get to after arrival in Barcelona, but takes a bit longer to get into the city. The rooms are well furnished, comfortble and stylish with elevated clear views across the city which the full length Windows take advantage of. Personal climate control was welcome with the heat. The bathrooms clean polished mirrors are wall to wall and is something to behold. I would stay again.",5,2014,03,16
30,Fira Suites,"hello, i would place TV in the rooms.  Staff in reception seemed undertrained and not as professional as other times I¬¥ve been there, it¬¥s like they were scared and with no attitude (smiling, chatting etc).  Beverages in rooms are way too expensive. Thanks",4,2014,03,12
30,Business trip,"Conveniently located close to BCN, 15' cab to the center of Barcelona. Third time in few months at Hesperia Tower. I always book a Suite:  spacious, one bedroom and a proper living room, well decorated, big bath with both shower and Jacuzzi. Large walk-in closet.
Big plus: access to the Tower lounge",5,2014,03,07
30,Expensive,This room was very nice but expensive and the mini bar  and snack food was very expensive and room service was expensive also .you would be charged to have ice cube to deliver to your room.very good breakfast.,3,2014,03,06
30,Hesperian Barcelona,"The room was Beautiful and clean.  We really we're impressed by the bathroom. Everything very modern and up to date.  The restaurant was a little pricey, but the service was good.  There was good access to public transportation.",5,2014,03,06
30,Stolen jewellery & charges for every step. Stay Away!,"We had 2 rooms booked on February 17-21st in this hotel, and we must say this is the worst hotel we ever stayed in:
     1. Theft - their housekeeping staff stole my wife's golden earrings from the bathroom
     2. Hidden Charges - on the website they brag about their facilities, etc. But what you will find is that they will charge you for every single step you want to make in the hotel. Surprisingly they don't charge for air!
     3. Poor customer service - we emailed our requirements to the hotel prior to arrival, but no one bothered to respond to our email. Hotel staff don't speak English, and even if they do - they are very unqualified and unfriendly

To conclude, stay away from this hotel. This is not a 5 star hotel but rather a real shame to the NH hotel group. 

Linas Pareigis",1,2014,02,23
30,Lovelt hotel but far from town,"We stayed at this hotel for a city break for three nights in November 2013.
The hotel itself is easy to get to from the airport. The rooms and inside of the hotel are modern, clean and stylish. 
We did not eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food but there are some nice little cafes around the area to get coffee and breakfast snacks if you don't mind a little walk.

The area is a little weird. Right next to main roads from the airport and next to a large hospital. There is a metro station next door which we used to get into town easily enough but next time we would stay in town as it would be a lot easier.

The price was good and hotel overall was lovely but is too far from town for my liking.

Also we hired a car in the end and were able to park In the street overnight which was free, the hotel parking is expensive!!",3,2014,02,19
30,Brilliant Stay,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for Valentines weekend. It was a beautiful hotel, that lived up to all our expectations. It was very modern and glamorous.

Our room was presented in excellent condition. The bathroom had to be our favourite as it was very stylish, however the lighting was a little dim. The shower was amazing!

We were looking forward to using the pool/gym area, unfortunately it was 14 euros per person which was quite disappointing. Remember to bring flip flops and a swimming cap(females) otherwise you will not be allowed in. 

Although we did not eat at the restaurant, we had room service one evening which was fantastic. 

The hotel staff were all extremely helpful and made our stay even more comfortable. 

Just across the road there is a Metro station which allowed us to travel to La Ramblas in about 20 minutes. The hotel is about a 15 minute drive from the airport. 

This was an amazing hotel and I would recommend this to everyone!",5,2014,02,18
30,Lifts slow - everything else good,Lifts to higher floor leave something to be desired. When many delegates attempt to use them the system appears to lock up. On a number of occasions it took over 20 minutes to get to my room and back to the lobby - when just collecting a ticket from the room,4,2014,02,17
30,Excelent stay,"This is a very good hotel.  Very convenient to and from airport and to town.  The breakfast was excellent.  Nothing wrong.  Exuse me, but I am not wrinting minimum characters sdndkASDALMADSBAksjkjadhjfhdfdhsafdkj",5,2014,02,17
30,Good choice for the Fira events. Avoid for tourism.,"Overall, good quality, clean rooms and nice breakfast selection. 
It is disappointing that there is no gym facilities. You can only use the next to hotel facilities, for a fee of 10 euros.

Conveniently located near a metro station but also far from the city center.",4,2014,02,17
30,Good design business hotel,"Very modern an stylish 5 star hotel with amazing lobby and suite like hotel room.
Highest quality of the accessories in the bathroom.

Internet access it not the fastest and I was missing a chair for the table to work at. There was a stylish design sofa combo  which made the room like a suite.

Unfortunately fitness and spa is not part of the hotel. You can use the very modern fitness studio outside the hotel for an extra fee. So you have to get fully dressed to there. (14 Euros)

Breakfast was fantastic and highest imaginable quality. Full American, English and Spanish choices.

Location is hard to reach from the Fira fair ground. Only via bus or taxi. Nothing around and quite a bit toward downtown.",4,2014,02,13
30,Great stay,"I've been at Hesperia Tower during a business week in Barcelona.
The hotel is pretty nice and well maintaned. Rooms are quite large and with modern furnishings.
The metro is a step ahead outside the hotel, so it's easy to get almost anywhere in Barcelona.
Just disappointing the gym/swimming pool access: 14 euro/day/person. Such hotels offer free access to those services.",4,2014,02,10
30,Very good choice for a business trip,"Not in a center of Barcelona, but if you are on a business trip and/or predominantly need access to Fira, the position is very good. Convenient access to the center via metro (the station is just cross the road). Not many restaurants are nearby, at least there are not many of them on Tripadvisor. Funny lift control system, if there is a big group of people requiring fast access to the floors.",4,2014,02,10
30,Spectacular hotel and nice staff,"I'll come back for sure, room was ok and the staff nice looking and kind, one of them speaks italian also. I just would like to have a dinner in the top restaurant which was closed during my stay. 
The distance to the center can be covered by taxi, free shuttle bus or by metro, so is not a problem.",5,2014,02,10
30,"Comfortable rooms, but needs improvement","On arrival at the Hesperia Tower, the outlook is not that great, it is located really in the middle of no where and the ""ponds"" (?) either side of the entrance look dirty with broken granite and concrete.  

However, reception was quick and easy and very helpful.  

The lifts are complicated to operate and a case of style over substance, and the software certainly could not cope with 50 people arriving back.  It took nearly 10 minutes for everyone to be able to go to their floors.

Having said that the rooms are clean and roomy, and have good free WiFi.  The breakfast is good, and if you need to be fast, you can be.

The restaurant on the top floor was closed, but there are others, and the food generally good (but avoid the pizza which have thick soggy bases), although not cheap.  There is no where around the hotel to eat, so you have to take a taxi (or metro) to go elsewhere, and there is a metro within 100m of the hotel.

Good for business, but would not wish to stay at the Hesperia if on pleasure.  If in Barcelona on business would be happy to stay there again.",3,2014,02,10
30,like you would expect in a 5 star place,"Great hotel in a land mark building. Pretty tall so you have a view on the see if you choose a room up. Restaurant quality is superb. Nice room, great bed, sufficient luxurious, wonderful breakfast, nearby Fira.",4,2014,02,08
30,The perfect hotel in Barcelona,"Not far from the airport and close enough to the city. Modern rooms, interesting design and beautiful decoration everywhere in the hotel, professional and friendly staff. Breakfast buffet with a big choice. 
I'll be back.",5,2014,02,08
30,Nice hotel but surprisingly average decor in room.,"This was a perfectly adequate hotel. No complaints, really. I just expected better...better decor in the room, better service from the lobby staff, better maid service. The room was just your basic room. Nothing special. The downstairs staff was ok if you asked a specific question but not proactive at all, the maids, though, are my only real complaint. They started cleaning the rooms at about 7:30 or 8am and slammed door after door all morning long. This happened every single day we were there! Awful. No chance of sleeping in in this hotel the week we stayed. Tough on newlyweds let me assure you!",4,2014,02,07
30,140119-140122,"Excellent hotel for a business stay, if your place of business is reasonably close. You must be aware this is not in the center or close to the center of Barcelona. Convenient airport and ""Fira"" access. Excellent breakfast; did not try the restaurant or the spa. Reliable, free WI-FI connection.",5,2014,02,07
30,Great stay,I had the pleasure of staying here on business for four days in January 2014. The staff were pleasant and always helpful. The room was great with all the things you would expect from a hotel of this type. Room service food was excellent and served quickly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona,5,2014,02,03
30,Gym is 14 euros,"Good hotel but five star 14 euros to use the gym !!! Never come across this before,  a better option is to go to the Renaissance .  You need to like dark rooms and dark receptions
And there is no tea coffee in the rooms. Aaaaaaasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas",1,2014,01,31
30,Great Hotel - outside of the centre,"The first thing to note is that the hotel is not in the centre of Barcelona - but to the south - near the business park and only 5 minutes taxi ride from the airport! This makes it great for business - especially if, like me, you are attending the FIRA Conference Centre (Just over 2 miles away).

All that said, the hotel is right at the southern end of the L1 (RED - Line 1) Underground line - and only 20 minutes ride into the centre of town. The Underground Station is only 200 meters walk across the road and car park - so very convenient. 

We were able to use the underground to head into the centre of the City to eat at night - with no problem at all. Just allow about 20 minutes travel each way!

We had a room on the 14th floor - overlooking the City. The views of the City and mountains are stunning. It's great to sit by the full length window and watch the nighttime lights.

Our room was great - with a nice bathroom combined with the wardrobe area - lots of mirrors and quite spacious. There was no bath - but a great shower - albeit 'Spanish plumbing'!

We shared a Club Sandwich in the downstairs bar - on our first day. This was definitely big enough for sharing, however, disappointingly, the fries were cold by the time they arrived and only a token apology was offered when I mentioned it. I would have expected more of a 5 star hotel.

There were only a limited number of coat-hangers available, bizarrely, my request for more resulted in a birthday cake arriving - but no coat-hangers. (Presumably, someone else is still wondering why they received 5 coat hangers for their birthday treat from the hotel!!).

Overall, this was a lovely hotel - the reception staff were very friendly - and no hesitation in returning. If you're looking for a central hotel to 'pop in and out of' during the day, then this is not for you! If, like me, you are happy to head out - and stay out, then it's a great place to stay.",4,2014,01,24
30,Great hotel,"My wife and I stayed at here for 3 night between Christmas and new year 2013. We arrived at midday and we're checked in with no problem and allocated our rom on the 11th floor. The room was lovely. Large comfortable bed god heating/conditioning and a great shower + dressing room area. Some of the furniture had seen better days with a few scratches and digs in the dressing table area, which would start to look tatty in the not too distant future if not attended to. Apart from that the room was perfect.  There did not seem to be many guest staying there due, I guess, to the time of year and two of the restaurants we're not open which we hadn't realised when deciding to leave the town early to eat at the hotel. We decided to order room service, something we've never done before on our travels. We didn't want anything too fancy and settled for a couple of pizzas and some fries which were decent enough. It's worth booking the breakfast as there was everything you could ask for cereals, pasties, could meats, fruit and a decent fried breakfast. I hadn't added breakfast at time of booking but it was easy to add this at the front desk and I'm glad we did it was a good start to the day. The staff were wonderful, all spoke excellent English which was extremely helpful as we only speak very basic pigeon Spanish and all were very attentive. I didn't realise at time of booking that the Hesperia Tower was 20 minutes out of the city centre and although the reviews all said this wasn't a problem I was a little nervous of having to find where we wanted to go speaking such basic Spanish. I needn't have worried apart from not quite following the front desk's directions to the metro station, which is Hospital de bellvitge, the travel to and around Barcelona City centre was extremely straight forward. We bought a 3 day travel card which allowed us to travel anywhere across the network and the metro system itself was very reliable. 
We had a wonderful time in Barcelona aided our stay at the Hesperia Tower, we will certainly be going back and when we do we will stay at the Hesperia Tower.

The one thing I would change is the transfer from the airport. There is a bus that runs a couple of times a day, we used this for our return flight, but I hadn't looked into the options before our trip instead deciding to get a taxi. Our driver said there was a minimum 25 Euro fare which to be honest didn't bother me too much. The meter read at 15 Euros. This may of just been his own rule and not a standard fare and as I say I wasn't too worried but seeing as there is the option of the free minibus it would foolish not to use this next time.  ",5,2014,01,22
30,Not quite the 5* that the hotel claims,"On the face of it, the Hesperia Tower is a modern 5* hotel with contemporary decor. Located near to the Fira de Barcelona, it is an excellent location if attending a conference or exhibition. Overall, the stay was very good. The beds were very comfortable and the quality of housekeeping extremely high, especially bearing in mind the large amount of unfriendly surfaces that the housekeepers were expected to maintain. It was also nice that the bathroom and wardrobe areas were in a separate lobby area with the bedroom past another door meaning the rooms were very quiet and not interrupted by noise from guests in the corridor. The iPod dock was also a nice addition. However, there were a few disappointing aspects that prevented a full 5* rating:

1. The rooms have way too any mirrors which made the room difficult to navigate and several times I hit a mirror expecting there to be a space. This was particularly so around the wardrobe area. I would consider this dangerous, especially if you are travelling with young children.
2. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room so you couldn't make an early morning hot refreshment to get you going.
3. The TV channels were almost completely Spanish which limited viewing for international guests. A 5* hotel should have a much wider range of international channels apart from the usual rolling news channels.
4. The idiotic lifts. In an attempt to maximise efficiency, you indicate the floor you want outside the lift and then the most appropriate lift arrives, but it means if you change you mind you have to call another lift rather than get in the one that you previously called and select a new floor. Plenty of guests were complaining how long it took for a lift to arrive, especially because the only stairs are external emergency stairs.

We only ate breakfast in the hotel, which was the usual international buffet, but it was tasty, very well presented and the staff always pleasant and efficient.

It's a nice hotel and has a lot to be positive about, but the few downsides prevented it getting a 5* rating.",4,2014,01,21
30,Best breakfast selection,"Been to Hesperia tower a few times during my business travels to Barcelona. Stanrard business type hotel with nice rooms, one thing that requires mentioning is (possibly) the best breakfast offer I ever seen. 
Location: good, taxi stop just 15 metres outside, 10-15mins drive from the airport, not so close to city centre
Staff: welcoming, quick during check out 
Rooms: in good shape, clean, very quiet, slept very well 
Restaurant & bar : did not go to one on top of hotel, used a standard one (cannot remember floo number) and was happy with what I got
Gym & pool: did not use 
Other: have to get used to strange elevator operating system",4,2014,01,19
30,Perfect for business,"One of he better hotels in Barcelona should you look for a location for a large meeting or conference. However close to a metroline, i would prefer to stay closer to the city center for a leisure visit. The rooms are perfect, clean. Food is excellent. 
",4,2014,01,19
30,"excellent, inspiring hotel","Great, unusual design, excellent service and excellent food.

I was there for a business meeting and didn't get to enjoy the spa but the guest rooms, meeting rooms, lobby/bar area and restaurants on the roof and 4th floor were all excellent.",5,2014,01,19
30,Beautiful Hotel,"What a beautiful hotel in the southern part of  Barcelona. 
Interior of hotel is very stylish, lobby is impressive  & room incl. bathroom are equally impressive,  nice materials have been used. A thing that I Iliked a lot was when entering the room for the first time you'll be surprised to enter it by the bathroom first before reaching the room itself. Bathroom is top of the bill, black marble is being used combined with four walls of only mirrors!!
Unless size of hotel, it's no problem to use one of the four elevators that are available in the hotel,covering some 30 floors. Due to an intelligent system which is choosing which elevator will bring you in the quickest way to your floor, you never have to wait too long to get to your floor. 
Breakfast is of great quality , only fresh food is being served. 
Although hotel is not in centre of Barcelona, metrostation is only a 5 minute walk away, metro brings you straight to Placa de Catalunya in the heart of Barcelona in 20 minutes. Airport is just a15 minute drive away (appr. 20 euro) from hotel
Unfortunately no coffee making facilities in room.",5,2014,01,18
30,"Top Hotel, Top Preis!","had a top Journey, excellent room, clean and Big. top Service. 15 Minutes by Metro from the Hotel to Barcelona Center. 20 Minutes to Camp Nou, 25 to Espanyol Stadium. The Hotel has 4 Restaurants, Highlight is the Evo Reataurant On the 29th floor.",5,2014,01,15
30,Nice combination of pleasure and business,"We combined business and pleasure. I arrived for three days for an international seminar and extended it for pleasure. The welcome was very friendly but still professional. The room was clean and had the comfort we expected, we slept very well. The location was optimal: 15' from airport (by taxi), 20' walk to the seminar and 20' by metro (line 1) to plaza Catalunya. Breakfast was fantastic: fresh and a wide choice. Free wifi was also appreciated.",4,2014,01,12
30,Luxurious and modern,"Spent a few days and especially New Year's Eve and New Year's Day there.   From the outside it's very ordinary and there's nothing to do around (university and metro).  However the inside is wonderful:  Modern, clean,  cosy bar, modern computerised lifts, magnificent suite on 23rd floor with a breathtaking view especially at night, 2 toilettes (!) with basin and telephone (!), electric shutters, very comfortable and big bed, walk in cupboard, shower massage, spa bath, enormous gym/body building complex with sauna, hammam, huge pool + another spa pool, 20 min direct ride by metro, across the road, to get into town and taxi rank just outside the hotel. Lovely personnel in the sports complex and also the majority of the reception staff.  Internet free.  Breakfast was excellent with local quality food and in abundance for 15 euros.   Worth every centime.

The downside:  No conciergerie and tourism information given is very limited and scarce, the bathroom products are given out sparingly, the Tower Club has drinks available all day (hot, cold, aperitifs etc) but there's rarely any personnel there and as for the little ""snacks"", it's shameful, some sweets (!!), a few olives and if you're lucky, something a  bit better but they go so fast and never replenished.  When asked for more as we only had one tiny spoon of salmon to share, we were told to eat the sweets and olives!!   Only one bottle of water on the day of our arrival.  We booked the suite with breakfast but upon arrival we were told that breakfast was continental and if we wanted the buffet one, it would cost 15 euros per person.   We chose, and didn't regret, the  buffet b/fast but I think it should have been made clear when booking, not upon arrival.

On New Year's Day, a little something in our room would have been a nice gesture but there wasn't anything.

If you want to be in the middle of things, this is not the place, it's a bit far out but the price is lower than the good hotels in town.",4,2014,01,10
30,Clean Room. Comfortable Bed. Reasonably Priced,"Booked as part of a 4-day Convention. So full of business types and very busy at breakfast. However the staff were on-the-ball and we were always quickly seated and there was plenty of food in the Breakfast Buffet.
The hotel seemed new and the room likewise. Bed was comfortable with clean linen.
In addition I was on a high floor so had a great view of Barcelona.
Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Quick with coffee refills etc.
Any downsides? Well if I was a tourist I would want to be more centrally located. If you want to go to the Marina area etc then you need a taxi. Although I was told the Metro was not too far away.
Overall the hotel was very good value, the room clean and comfortable, with helpful staff.
For business travellers who need to be in this area I have no problems recommending this hotel.",4,2014,01,03
30,5 Stars!,"We had a convention there and I have to say that it is simply perfect. Rooms, breakfast, restaurant, wifi, taxi always available ... perfect
I've been in the suites and the only problem is that you have to exit outside to reach the main hotel for the breakfast and then back to the suites",5,2013,12,20
30,Great Hotel,"I found this hotel at a very good deal and was a little skeptical. However, it exceeded all of my expectations except the cigarette smell. It is very clean and very modern. It is now in the center of Barcelona; however, the Metro is across the street and in 4 or 5 stops you are in the center of Barcelona. We stayed here for approximately 3 nights before taking a Mediterranean cruise. It was perfect. The distance to the port was about 15 minutes. The best thing about this hotel is that there is a taxi stand right across the street. No long lines, no waiting period. We were charged about $25.00 to go to the port. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
NOTE: If you are a swimmer, please bring swimming shoes and head cap because they will not let you use the pool unless you have both.",4,2013,12,16
30,Very convenient and comfortable,"This hotel was the last onel of my 1st tour, and despite of the wifi connection, I have to admit that it was very comfortable, with a huge room including a kitchen and a huge bathroom. The wifi connection was poor but anyway I could connect my device a couple of hours later. My tourist guide recommend me a chinese buffet restaurant located a few blocks from the hotel, and I have to admit that it was the best chinese buffet I've ever tried, because of its price, variety and service. The hotel is located far from the centre but there was public transportation close to the hotel, and also supermarkets and a hospital, in case of an emergency!",4,2013,12,15
30,Good Hotel,"We stayed at this Hotel as it was close to the airport and five star which we booked on Hotwire.  I would not say the Hotel was five star as the room was on the small side.   Also, the food available at the Hotel was expensive and limited.   For those looking to go downtown Barcelona which is about a 15 minute drive the best option is subway.  The subway system was awesome, safe, cheap and fast.   There is a stop right across from the Hotel in the hospital parking lot.   We are from Canada and had no trouble navigating the subway system.  

Also, no ice machines in the Hotel, I had to take a small bucket to the bar area and wait about 10 minutes to get some ice put in it.",3,2013,12,14
30,Modern and interesting,"Stayed for a conference. Hotel is very modern and well outside the city, however the metro is next door. The room I stayed in was a little odd. You enter from the corridor the bathroom which was full of mirrors! Bed was great. Internet realiable and the food excellent.  Would have got 5 stars if the gym was free. It cost 14 euros a time.",4,2013,12,12
30,Great experience.,"I had a girlie weekend away with friends for my birthday. This hotel is amazing. A real 5 star experience. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the shower is amazing. It's quite close to the airport, 7 mins journey and about 20 mins from the city centre. Great transport links as the Metro is across the street and taxis stationed outside. We dinner in one one of the restaurants, fantastic and affordable. On the evening of my birthday I returned to my room to find a birthday cake and drinks compliments of the hotel. Staff spoke perfect english and were very helpful. I definitely recommend staying here. ",4,2013,12,12
30,Excellent,"This hotel offered a great view, great access to public transportation, 2 minutes from the subway.

It also offered:
- a spacious hotel room at a great price compared to what we saw available in all Barcelona
- great comfortable bed
- the window coverings would close by a push of a button!
- spacious bathroom and closet
- bathrobe and slippers
- a safe for your valuables
- fridge and snacks (pretty pricey)
- great complimentary wireless internet reception 
- friendly staff

One thing that we were disappointed was to learn that their was an additional fee to use the pool as this had been one of the reasons why we choose this hotel.",5,2013,12,11
30,More than we expected,The room itself and bathroom was huge. Lots of space to put all your luggage out of sight with plenty of closet space to put your clothes away. I was surprised with the bathroom amenities. Close to the train. Shuttle to the airport is first come first serve. Don't forget you need to insert your room key for the power to work.,4,2013,12,01
30,Annual Conference,Excellent spacious hotel with a range of restaurants.  The bar in the lobby was understaffed and so the service here was poor.  Everything else from the service in the restaurants to the left luggage was efficient and well handled.,4,2013,11,27
30,Home from home in Barca,"Great venue, spacious rooms and lovely breakfast. It's more a business hotel but also stayed there for leisure... with the shuttle provided you are quickly in the centre, but taxi's a cheap in Spain. The staff remembers it's clients from last year and it's good to see it's a stable team. ",5,2013,11,27
30,FABULOUS HOTEL!,"This is really a superb five star hotel with a practical location between the airport and the city centre of Barcelona. I had a lovely room with a wonderful bed from which there was a stunning view of the city. My bathroom was fabulous. The breakfast is really excellent!

The location was not a problem as there is a subway station close by the hotel with a direct connection to central parts of the city.",5,2013,11,25
30,Lovely hotel...felt very spoilt.,"Beautiful hotel... Top notch everything from the reception, rooms, dining, breakfast.... The lot. You won't be disappointed with this hotel.... However the location isn't great but a train or bus from right outside will take you to the centre in about 25 mins... This is the only downside. There is not much at all around this hotel. Do not let this put you off though as everything isn't far away and it is away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre and off pick pockets. Lol x",5,2013,11,14
30,"""He's from Barcelona..."" Thrown out and electrocuted","We had booked a suite, but somehow the reception didn't really believe my wife, when she showed up together with our son (she looks kind of nice, though). A strange and long discussion ensued and eventually my family was directed to a rather depressing apartment in a separate building next to the Media Markt (excellent location, if you're looking to buy a new CD player). 

My wife gave up and headed to the bar with a hungry kid. Then I showed up and things got surprisingly constructive. We were quickly moved to the very nice suite, we had booked and everybody excused the mishap. Even my wife's drinks were paid for...

Electrocuted?... Think twice before you use the hair dryer. My petty North European health and safety concerns triggered a bunch of chocolates though...  

Would we go there again: probably not, and if we did with rubber soles.",3,2013,11,07
30,Lovely Hotel but Isolated,"Stayed 2 nights at this Hotel.  Booked it initially as a 'Top Secret' Hotel on Last Minute.com and got a favourable price for the star rating of the hotel.  Chose it because it advertised a free shuttle to and from the airport and the city centre.....however, this ran twice in the morning, 1000 and 1040 and twice in the evening which can hardly be called a 'shuttle service'.  The hotel is accessible by metro which is clean and easy and very cheap compared to London and easy enough to understand !!!.
I really don't know how hotels are awarded their star rating as there is no way I would have rated this a 5 star.  Found it quite tatty and we weren't even left a complimentary bottle of water !.  The swimming pool was attached to the hotel so was not a part of the hotel and not even owned by it so not accessible to the guests unless you were happy to pay 14 euros each a day !!!.
Staff were lovely at reception and extremely welcoming and helpful.
Breakfast was extremely expensive at 24 euros each so needless to say we did not eat there ! and a kit kat chocolate bar in the room minibar was 7 euros !!!...who prices these things ?????
There was absolutely nothing around the hotel which we were surprised seeing as there is a hospital and a university nearby.....not a shop or caf√©....absolutely nothing except for a Media Mart if one was inclined to buy a tv !!!.",3,2013,11,04
30,"Lovely hotel, accessible location. Shame about the cost of all the extras","We booked this hotel for our 'minimoon' and stayed 4 nights. We got a great deal on the room so upgraded to the suite for 50 euros a night. For a special occaision it was well worth it. We were on the 19th floor overlooking the city and watched the dawn every morning from bed through the floor to ceiling windows (electronic curtain openers meant we didn't even have to move!). A luxurious bathroom with wet room monsoon shower and 2 person jacuzzi was amazing - what wasn't was the very slick marble floor that caused me to slip twice and fall once. We took to spreading towels over the entire floor! 2 toilets, separate dressing room and sitting room completed the suite. nice touches were the ipod/iphone dock and Bulgari toiletries (although when these were restocked, a generic brand was used). The bed was simply enormous! I have never seen one that big in all my travels - literally had to crawl across it to reach my husband in the morning!

Location has been mentioned a couple of times here. Yes it is a little out of town, but the metro station (underground) is only across the street and it's a 20 minute ride into town and you don't have to change so it's simple as anything. And to come home it's only a 14 euro taxi after midnight. Yes it can be annoying to travel back to the hotel to nap and freshen up before heading out for the evening, but it was worth it to have such a swanky base (a similar level of luxury would have cost double if we were in the city centre). It was also only 13 euros to get to Barceloneta beach. But the Metro is perfect. We bought a 10 trip pass for less than 10 euros which lasted us the whole trip.

We didn't eat at the hotel as we felt the prices to be absolutely extortionate. Minibar prices were also steep at 7 euros for a 250ml bottle coke. I know they always mark these up, but that's ridiculous. We also felt that having to pay 14 euros to use the gym (per day) was unecessary and should have been included.

All in all an amazing hotel. The things I have picked up on are so niggly that if that is all I can complain about it was amazing! Would definitely book again.",4,2013,11,02
30,Great hotel for Barcelon trip,"This is a great place to stay to see and experience Barcelona. It's in between the city and the airport. These are high end accommodations with a breakfast buffet that included foods for a variety of ethnic groups. In-house restaurant is fabulous with gourmet selections. A welcome haven from the intensity of the city.

Make sure to tell you cab driver Hesperia Tower Hospitalet so they know which one to go to. The Metro is across the street and easy to use.",5,2013,11,01
30,Great Hotel,"Before going, thought this hotel is difficult to reach.  I took bus from Airport and just 15 minutes then arrived.  However, the bus station is not clearly specified and I thought I got off one station earlier,  anyway, still not too far to walk.  
Check in and check out was efficient.  Hotel was clean, quiet, with good wifi connection.  Just the TV Channels mainly are in Spanish!
There are some local restaurants nearby the hotel, at the back of 'Media Mart'.  Walking to subway/metro is around 5 minutes.",5,2013,10,30
30,overnight stay,stayed in the heperia tower fira suites on saturday night. the the suit i was in was excellent and had everything that you possibly need for a suite. the hotel is a bit out from the city centre but there is a metro station withing 5 minutes walk which will get you into city very easily. there is also a good bus service.,5,2013,10,29
30,Beautiful Infrastructure and easily accessible(metro and airport),"Barcelona, Sapin: Stayed in June 2013, travelled on company trip.

Hesperia Tower, Barcelona is an easy approach from airport(15minutes) and metro train(5 minutes). I came to Barcelona from Madrid using the superfast train within 3 hours(top speed of 300kmph). Hotel is located at easy distance from Barcelona sants station. Tour operator took care of the transit to the hotel. Since I was on company trip the check in was easy though the keys troubled me a few times. Lifts are automated and drops you on the floor your room is. The infrastructure is awesome. Rooms are quite big and gives a complete view of the city and I believe it is one of the highest building in that area. I climbed up to the top to experience the view of Barcelona city. Bathroom area is also well designed and looks beautiful. 

Since we were a lot of people from the company in the hotel breakfast was served on the 4th floor and serving staff was very corteous.Dinner was served in the hall located just above the gym area of the hotel. A bit of disappointment was gym charges for the hotel guests,though its offered complimentary everywhere.

Metro station(Hospital de Bellvitge) was nearby through which I with my friends traveled to almost every well known locations. It is easy to travel and cheap too(costed only 2 euros per trip and discounts if the group is bigger). Locals were helpful if you needed directions. We also boarded their tour buses which charged 26Euros per day and 34Euros for two days, they are the best way to explore the whole Barcelona city. You can drop at a destination and roam around and then hop in a different bus to other destination. The weather was also beautiful and we enjoyed sity view on the bus top. La Rambla street is one of the major junction for these buses and major tourist spot.Hard Rock Cafe is situated next in the corner serving refreshing cocktails.

Even though I didn't stayed long in Barcelona, however I enjoyed a lot visiting major attractions in the city easily and efficiently. Thanks a lot for the comfortable stay. Will visit again for a longer stay.

I would rate 4/5 to Hesperia Towers, Barcelona.",4,2013,10,29
30,Catalonian modernity,"Hesperia Tower is an excellent and extremely modern hotel. The building itself is fantastic. Rooms are big, windows are enormous and the views from the city are astonishing. The black-mirrored bathroom is utterly an attraction. You can feel a little bit dizzy while facing so many mirrors in a total black space, but is difficult to deny this bathroom is unique. There is a excellent gym close outside the hotel, accessible for 14 euros per day to be payed at the reception. There's a big pool and an excellent sauna. As an advice, especially suitable for city's first time visitors: it is not the ideal place for you to stay. This hotel fits best those that have visited Barcelona several times before.",4,2013,10,27
30,LNG Conference,"The hotel is situated 15-20 minutes from airport and costs 20 euros in a taxi. On arrival you are greeted by a pleasant looking reception with a very modern look. Check in was easy and efficient though you could not check in early. Getting to your room was an experience as you need to swipe your room card then select your floor before you can enter the lift. I was in room 2108 which faced the city and I was afforded very scenic views and a great view at night with all the lights. The room was modern though somewhat disorienting when first entering as you enter straight into the closet and the en-suite area surrounded by modern tiling, glass doors and mirrors. A glass door leads into the bedroom and residing area with all mod cons available except for beverage making facilities. There is a fridge stocked with drinks however they are over priced as are customary in hotels. There were twin beds with fresh linen and extra pillows if required. The TV was flat screen and modern and the room had an efficient A/C unit keeping the room at the required temp. I had a good sleep on all nights that I stayed. 

The en-suite was modern with a great shower that afforded plenty of room. A nice touch was the travel sets of tooth brush with paste and shaving sets replenished daily. Also a free safe, bathroom slippers and bath robes were supplied. Wifi was free as well but kept dropping out. 

Breakfast was served on the 4th floor and consisted of a variety favoured on the continent. I was a little disappointed with the breakfast and the toaster was very slow considering the volume of people using it.

I had one meal in the restaurant situated on the second floor and though the food was ok it was not inspiring. The staff were pleasant even if the service was slow to be seated, and attended to as the bistro/restaurant was not excessively busy in my opinion. from entering to eating took over 40 minutes for what was a burger and chips with a beer. 

The bar was typically priced though I was disappointed that it tended to close at 1am. I don't expect a 4 star hotel bar to do so when many residents are still in attendance.",4,2013,10,22
30,VMworld Europe Destination Hotel,"Our company chose to stay here for VMworld Europe.  The rooms are updated, modern and clean.  The hotel staff were very helpful and polite.  There is a convention center at the back of the hotel but that is not where VMworld was held as it was in the main convention center for the city.  The subway was about 10 minute or less walk away from hotel and there were some convenient grocery and food locations nearby the hotel about 5 minutes walk away.  The hotel was about 10 minutes from the airport via cab.  Overall it was a great experience and would definitely recommend and stay here again.",4,2013,10,21
30,Lovely hotel - Shame about the elevators :),"Great business hotel, great accomodation, food, exibition space.  It's all top notch.
I'd definately recomend this to anyone going on business or organising an event.

I was there for a business conference and the carering, support and facilities were amongst the best I've seen in all my travels.

Now the one bad thing - OMG the elevators! I'm going to have a bit of a rant because it's quite funny.
They have 4 beautiful elavators to the rooms and restaurants, all 4 are controlled by a software system driven by a touch screen console - NO UP DOWN BUTTONS.
So you push where you want to go on the screen and it is meant to summon an elevator and then send it there - if you're lucky.
The wait is tedious and when the ting does arrive, you need to toss a coin if it goes the right way.  From reception it's easy up is the only way, but if you want to go from restaurant on floor 4 to anywhere else - you just gotta hope it works, otherwise you go on a lovely scenic tour of the rest of the floors and eventually get there.
In 2 days going from floor 4 to reception on ground floor I didn't once manage to go direct - 3 times it sent me round the other floors, once up to top ffloor (25) and alll the way back down.

BRING BACK UP/DOWN BUTTONS !",4,2013,10,18
30,Expected more ,Went here for a weekend got to reception they wanted a credit card I for have one so had to leave a large cash deposit which I was not happy about !! The rooms looked lovely apart from a big crack in one of the mirrors !!! It's also very expensive but the rest was nice untill we came to eat in the restaurant how awful the food was !!! Would not recommend at all !!! ,3,2013,10,16
30,"Stylish, modern hotel- isolated feeling location","I visited this hotel with my Partner as part of a 10-day stay in Barcelona. We decided to take a taxi from the airport, which was a nice short trip from the hotel, but the driver insisted we pay him a minimum fare of 25 euros. The hotel was very impressively decorated, even from the outside. The staff spoke very good English and pleasantly offered my Partner a Hugo Boss sample set (though nothing was offered to me!). 

The interior is seriously impressive, a must for people who like modern design. We were given a room facing the city and quite high up. The room was spacious and we had a full length window spanning one side which gave spectacular views, especially at night. The bathroom (which you met as you entered the hotel room) was stylish and had an amazing walk-in shower.

This hotel offers a mini bus service, but if you are like me, i.e. like a lie in and dislike having to follow a timetable on holiday you will find this service not very useful. The nearest metro stop is less than 5 minutes walk away, so I would recommend taking the metro into the city centre instead- eventhough it is roughly a 20/25 minute ride (no changes to Catalunya).

My main issue with this hotel is that if you do not fancy making the journey into the city centre, you are basically stuck with very few shops (e.g. supermarkets) and even fewer local restaurants. The staff were not very helpful in suggesting local places and it can be intimidating exploring yourself, especially after dark, as the area is largely residential and not very well lit. 

Finally, if the 'spa' attribute of this hotel is what is making you want to stay then I would say STOP don't be fooled. This Hotel has an attached (but external) gym which is roughly 15 euros to enter. The gym has a swimming pool but this is functional not for relaxing (e.g. you are required to wear a swimming cap) and a health sauna which is heavily used by the locals who come for the gym. It is not a relaxing spa and for the extra money once was enough- definitely a let down as I love my spa getaways!",4,2013,10,12
30,Good value for money,I had a look at some reviews on here before I booked this hotel and really worried about the location. It did not affect our day whatsoever and was worthy getting such a beautiful hotel slightly out of town. Only takes 15 minutes on the tube which is very cheap. The hotel is absolutely stunning and the rooms meet these standards too. The bar in the hotel is overpriced but that would be my only negative!! Such brilliant value for money and very close to the airport. Would highly recommend. ,4,2013,10,11
30,Excellent but far,"A superb hotel with great amenities. 
We were given a room on 21st floor and the hotel had great views. Rooms were big and spacious and my 2 yr old kiddo was also very excited.
The breakfast at the hotel was just amazing with great option for vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
We also bumped into some great football players at the hotel.
The only drawback was that the hotel was too far from the city center and although the hotel provided free shuttle services they usually went full some people had to take a cab or metro services.",4,2013,10,11
30,Highlight of our trip,"My fiance and I splurged a bit by getting a suite here for the weekend before our Mediterranean cruise. But the cruise ended up being quite a downgrade after staying here. I'm going to be dreaming about this place. There is no way you could ever get a comparable place in Toronto without spending hundreds more per night. The suite was the size of our apartment. It had this enormous jacuzzi, a gigantic walk-in closet, and wall-to-wall windows with a perfect view of the city. The shower had these extra heads that spray directly at your body- I'd never seen anything like them. And then there was the executive lounge, where you could pour yourself a beer or fix yourself a cocktail for free! AND there was the spa, which was this crazy oasis of steam rooms, saunas, hot tubs, etc. And yeah, the hotel is a bit far away from the downtown core, but it's a short walk to a subway station, which connects you to anywhere in Barcelona that you might want to go. Not that we did much of that - we basically spent the whole weekend spa-ing and partying in the hotel! Unforgettable.",5,2013,10,10
30,Lots of good points. Plenty of bad points. Check the location you want.,"Above all check where you want to me. If you want to be in the heart of Barcelona this hotel is not for you as it‚Äôs located between airport and city so taxis/buses are needed to go anywhere. Few shops around, and almost no dining options but the hotel. Its basically a business park with a massive hospital and uni. 

Assuming you are happy with the location (which we were as we‚Äôve been to BCN many times) we found the rooms very comfy, and good value. The hotel is clean, modern and a great place for the business traveller or those on conferences (which make up most of the clientele). 

As other reviewers have stated they use the health club next door and charge 14 euros per person for gym/spa/pool access and you need flip flops and a swimming cap. We didn‚Äôt mind paying it as it was an amazing facility for a hotel but I could understand people getting annoyed as you kind of expect a free fitness facility in a 5 star hotel ‚Äì but it didn‚Äôt bother us as the facility was excellent. 

Again, as others have stated dining options are just hotel based other than a small caf√© around the corner that opens for lunch. We have no problem paying hotel food prices and we found the hotel food excellent BUT the variety was lacking and few ‚Äòbasic‚Äô options were available. All the food had ‚Äòflair‚Äô but sometimes you just want the basics and these weren‚Äôt available. It was fine dining or nothing. That said, all the food was excellent. 

We enjoyed our stay very much, and we would return but I can see many reasons why others may want to double check what you want out of a hotel before they book here as it wouldn‚Äôt suit everyone. 

Finally, there were quite a few service elements which could be improved. Housekeeping missing certain things each day, leaving a dirty wet cloth on the bed, phones going unanswered etc. Nothing major, but left us wanting more in the service area.",4,2013,10,10
30,Very nice place to stay,"Perfect hotel close to the airport. Possibility to go to the center with the hotelbus. Close to the metro station.
Wonderfull rooms. Top roof restaurant with a sight over Barcelona. Perfect breakfast.
Helpfull frontoffice people.
Hotel to keep in mind for a stay in Barcelona as well on holiday as for business.",5,2013,10,10
30,Top of the bill!,"Great hotel. Excellent modern design, clean, wonderful. The location is quit far from the city center but it is actually half way the airport and the city center. If you do not feel like taking a taxi, the city bus stops right across the road and connects both the airport and the city. This will set you back only about 2 Euro's.

The restaurants are absolutely top of the bill.",5,2013,10,04
30,"Great room, friendly help","The hotel is beautiful, the room was comfortable and bigger than we had expected.  Especially the bathroom, comfy robes and slippers included!  The free shuttle downtown was a plus.  We did have to take taxis sometimes when the shuttle wasn't running, but the taxi stop is right at the hotel and the average taxi cost was about 15-20 euros.  The breakfast was good but a little pricey.  We forgot our converter and the girl at the front desk said we could buy one for 5 euros, but they were out of the one we needed, so they would get us one in the morning, but in the meantime they had one a previous guest had left behind and they said we could see if it worked and it did, problem solved!  The front desk was very friendly and helpful.  I would definately stay here again.",5,2013,09,30
30,Week-end Away,"Wonderful Hotel, lovely staff, fabulous breakfasts with stunning bathrooms!

We stayed on the 20th Floor with floor to ceiling windows and gorgeous views all over Barcelona, whilst the Hotel is a way out of the City it is easy to get to Catalunya Sq where everything is, by the Metro stop 2 min walk and opposite the Hotel...no changes direct in!  Be mindful that the last train back is at Midnight!

Only dissapointment was the Spa, not the pool on the sales details and you have to pay 14 Euros to use it even if you are a Hotel Guest!!...Err No thank you!!

Didnt like the glass sided lift , but there is an option to not use this one!

Paid 32E from the airport to the Hotel in a Taxi felt slightly robbed and sure this wasnt right, but didnt have enough Spanish to Question - free shuttle bus from the Hotel back to the airport.",4,2013,09,26
30,"Good, but why is the tower closed??","Had a good time, but was not aware that the tower resturant was closed (something about the chef had died), and there are some inroom wi-fi issues to fix. They have the most confusing elevator system ever!
      ",4,2013,09,24
30,Business trip,"Excellent hotel with excellent service
Resturants was perfect
Very elegant rooms
The main concern is the location was away from everything
I enjoyed my stay with the friendly staff and nice Cafe in the ground floor
The restaurant in the tower was perfect but expensive , I recommend to visit it",4,2013,09,23
30,Great Bargain on the Outskirts of Barcelona,"The Hesperia Tower and Conference Center is a wildly modern and beautiful hotel on the outskirts of Barcelona but convenient to all forms of transportation so that the city itself is only about 20 minutes away.  It is more of a bargain than similar hotels downtown and has a fabulous health club attached to it.  The restaurants are outstanding and the breakfast buffet rivals the Ritz in Paris.  Barcelona was crammed with two festivals, so we actually enjoyed being away from the crowds.",5,2013,09,23
30,Beautiful hotel no where near anything a visitor wants to see,Very modern hotel.  One star Michelin restaurant.  Even smaller restaurant is expensive and does not like to accept credit cards.  Will not accept or exchange travelers checks.  About ‚Ç¨16 taxi fare to old Barcelona.  We were told that there is a strip shopping center about ‚Ç¨ 4 cab ride that has places to eat.  Excellent breakfast buffet.  Near to airport.,3,2013,09,22
30,Nice hotel,"We stayed at this hotel before leaving on a cruise. It was close to the airport and the price was right as we had 3 rooms total.  We were able to check into the room early to take a shower after an all night flight before sightseeing so that was nice!  Other than the airport, this hotel is not located close to anything.  We were able to find a cafe for pastries in the am and ordered Domino's Pizza for dinner because it was much cheaper than eating at the hotel and that is what the kids requested!  The front desk was not helpful at all in my quest to order pizza and it took several phone calls to find the correct location.  I got the impression that they really wanted us to eat on sight which was not cheap.  The bathroom was very large.  Bed was very comfortable and everything was very new.  If you are looking for a nice hotel with a reasonable price that is close to the airport, this is a great choice.",4,2013,09,20
30,GREAT FOOD> OUTSTANDING CONFERENCE VENUE,"The hotel restaurant is the highlight of the trip. 5 STAR food from start to finish. Wait staff eager to satisfy our experience. Location is a long metro trip to center city. Local area has NO shopping, dining  or walking opportunities. Most suited for a conference venue . That was my reason to be here and it far outweighed my expectations.",5,2013,09,19
30,Fantastic weekend at Hesperia,"A very nice hotel, that deserves all five stars. Nice rooms. Beautiful bathrooms. On my wife's birthday there was a delicious birthday cake waiting for us on the hotel room. And nobody told them, it was her birthday! 
      ",5,2013,09,18
30,An Excellent Hotel,"One of the best Hotel at Barcelona.  A modern look at all interior areas with dark colors and minimal furniture compose a fancy atmosphere. Close to airport and 10 minutes from ra lampla make it ideally located. 
      ",4,2013,09,18
30,DISAPPOINTED,"We would like to share our experience from this hotel. Our expectations were may to high, but come on, this suppose to be a 5* hotel.

1. Several occasion we experienced that the cardkey for our room didn't work. Several time we had to stand in a long line for getting that fixed.
2: Sending the kid to the reception for asking for the direction to a restaurant resulted on reception sent him back to the room with NO answer due to he was not wearing shoes. Not acceptable behaviour - hotel must inform upon arrival that it is prohibited to walk in the hotel without shoes!
3: We were looking forward to visit the Evo restaurant at the top of the building, which by the way was the only restaurant in the hotel for decent food. This was closed! The hotel should have informed about that when we booked, or at least when we checked in!
4: We were looking forward to spend time 2gether in the Spa area. The hotel had a minimum age of 16 to get into this area. We as a family could not use this oppertunity which we all had been looking forward to. Should be informed when we booked the hotel.
5: Watch out, zero restaurants in the neigbourhood. You need to dedicate a lot of time for planning your lunch/dinner if you stay at this hotel.
6: We had high expectations for the Tower club. No service what so ever! The breakfast consisted of a minimum of food, the lounge breakfast reminded of a 2* hotel breakfast. If we wanted to have ""real"" breakfast we had to pay 15 euro's pr head. Not acceptable when we had paid a fortune for staying at a 5* hotel.
7: The bus shuttle was a joke only going to desert places both city centre and an unknown beach. Several",1,2013,09,16
30,Still wondering how it has a 5-star rating....,"You pay EUR 4 for a cuppa (each). The pool is part of the Spa, and therefore costs you EUR 14 per person per day, which wasn't mentioned on any website (the Spa and it's extra cost was, but not that the Pool was part of that, misleading IMHO). If you hadn't booked breakfast with your trip (ie, standard rate), it costs a whopping EUR 24 per person.

The airport transfer stops at 18.00, comes once an hour, and full=full which means to wait another hour, same for the shuttle into town (same vehicle, not even a van I would expect with a 5-star Hotel)

The lobby furniture looked (and was) worn, hallways not air-conditioned...

At least the bed was a reasonable size (for being 6'3"").",3,2013,09,16
30,Ugly hotel on the outside,"Booked this hotel as a Secret Deal on Lastminute.com so got a very good price. First impression of this hotel was OMG looks garish and tacky however, once inside we got a very different impression. Lots of marble and glass and a very modern hotel. Check in very smooth and staff friendly.Our room which was on the 11th floor was clean and fresh. The rooms are all marble, glass and mirrors which creates a feeling of space, however, a bit confusing at times as didn't know which was a mirror or a door. The rain Shower was amazing, large soft white towels which were changed daily. We found the bed to be a bit too hard, which detracted from our stay. Curtains work with remote control. Mini bar fridge full of drinks etc but prices steep with bottled water costing 6 Euros. Just behind hotel there is a little group of shops and they sell water for 21 cents for 1.5ltrs. Breakfast costs 16.50 Euros  pp if  booked the night before, otherwise 24 Euros. So it pays to book it ahead. Breakfast consists of fruit, cereals, hot buffet, eggs, bacon  etc. Probably not great value though. The hotel is located quite far out (30 mins) but the Metro station is just across the carpark opposite. The station is Hospital de Bellvitge which is the end of the line on L1.  The metro is very very easy to use and if you buy a 10 trip ticket  (T10) from the ticket machine inside the station it will only cost 9.8  Euros. Ticket can be used by multiple persons as all you need to do is re enter the ticket  for each person as they go through the turnstile. Individual tickets cost 2.00 per trip so the T10 is a good deal. Open top hop on hop off bus, is a must costs 26 euros pp for one day or 34 euros for 2 days. we bought the 2 day passes and used the first day to do all the different trips, red, blue and green. Check routes as we found the red route to be the best. Then on the 2nd day we hopped on and off at our leisure. very good value. Lots to see and do in Barcelona. BE WARY OF RIP OFF TAXI'S. On arrival at the airport we attempted to take a taxi a short distance to our hotel (7km's) which should have cost around 15.20 euros, however, when we asked for a price they said 30-40 and got very angry when we said this was too much, in the end we got into a cab and made sure the meter was on. on arrival at the hotel (5 mins later) the taxi meter showed 13.5 euros however the driver asked for 35 euros and when we questioned the difference he said there was a 20 euro sur charge. We disputed this and said we would go inside the hotel and get the manager out to talk to him. He then changed his manner and said we should pay him what we wanted. We paid him 20 euros which was probably still too much. We asked in the hotel about this and they said there is no sur charge and he was trying to rip us off. So be careful !!!!  Overall we really enjoyed staying at the Hesperia Towers, but probably wouldn't stay there again due to the location.",4,2013,09,10
30,Good business hotel,"Modern business hotel, with good conferencing facilities and nice enough rooms.
Checkin/out was efficient with friendly service. Free wifi was really appreciated and fast.
Room service was patchy-one occasion was good and efficient whilst the other took over an hour to arrive. Pity the pool/health club was chargeable and would expect this to be inclusive at a 5 star hotel.

If you need a good business hotel close to the airport for a short term stay, this works well but too far from the city for any meaningful leisure activities.",4,2013,09,07
30,Stunning Hotel but expensive extra's,"On arrival at Barcelona we looked for the free shuttle service but soon realised that you can only use this service from Terminal 1 and we arrived at Terminal 2.It's a limited service anyway so we used the local red bus number 46 ,look for the bus stop just outside Termial 2 the bus we used had Placa Espanya as the destination ,it costs 2 euro's each .The bus stops opposite the hotel and you need to cross the road and use the underpass to get to the hotel,you can recognise the hesperia as it looks as if a UFO has landed on he roof ! Checking in was straight forward and the staff where friendly and efficient  a good tip is to ask for a room on a higher floor with a city view if possible. The room we had was very modern lots of glass and chrome the bed was comfortable and the shower hot and powerful .The only downside was the air conditioning which was useless but after complaining we were eventually moved to a different room. We didn't use any of the hotel facilities as they where too expensive but we found a very good cafe very close to the hotel which was friendly cheap and clean , we had breakfast there every morning and the coffee was excellent .We also went to the local bar in the evening it was much cheaper than drinking in the hotel.
Getting into Barcelona was no problem we used the Metro which was just across the car park opposite the hotel you can get a 10 trip ticket from the station and costs just under 10 euros. On departure we used the free shuttle service the hotel provided but if that's not available  use the number 46 bus which is about  400 mtrs away across the car park by the side of the hospital there are buses every 20 minutes .",4,2013,09,06
30,Lovely hotel in the middle of nowhere,"That said, there's a metro stop 5 minutes walk away, so you can get downtown in 30 minutes or so. Note that there's a gas station with a shop right next door. That's where you want to buy your cold drinks and sandwiches. (They didn't have a shop in the hotel.) On the other side of the hotel was an amazing electronics store -- very nicely air conditioned. And yes, everything said about the hotel shuttle is true. It's every man for himself. You better be lined up 30 minutes in advance to get on. (So, why not just take the subway??) Our flight got in late, so the shuttle wasn't running then anyways, so we took a taxi -- and given timing issues, we took a taxi back to the airport, too. It was 20 Euros flat rate from the airport, but more going to the airport, maybe 26 Euros? The elevators are interesting... very high-tech.",5,2013,09,06
30,Airport hotel with metro connection into city,"Very modern-looking hotel from both the inside and out. Checking-in in English was painless with plenty of people on reception. 

Be aware that the accommodation does not start until the 7th floor and you will ave to take the lift. (The only stairs are external fire exits - so be aware if you are not a fan of lift!) The lifts actually have a touchscreen system to request your destination before you enter and the system then informs which lift will arrive next. It's easy to use, just not the norm!

We stayed in a twin room on the 11th floor. The layout was a little different, walking through the bathroom to the bedroom. 

In the bathroom there was a separate toilet cubicle and a separate shower cubicle. 2 sinks and a large walk in wardrobe with drawers.

The bathroom did have a door separating it into the main room. The beds were comfortable and air conditioning worked well. We did have a problem with the TV but turned out someone had unplugged it. The windows were floor to ceiling and the width of the room, although we were looking over the hospital and the airport the view was still good. Tip - the curtains are operated by a switch byeside the bed.

So why not 5 stars? The room did not feel of 5-star quality. There were scratches all over the furniture and paneling - a furniture scratch remover pen would make it look better! The large bathroom mirror was damaged in the corner possibly from water damage. The sliding door to the wardrobe did not slide along correctly due to the upper track needing repair.  There was also a spot light out in the bathroom - we did not report it but it did get changed towards the end of our stay.

There was also a large black stain that greated you on the carpet as you exited the lifts on the 11th floor.

The mini bar in the room was redicoulsly expensive. Who would pay ‚Ç¨6 for a small bottle of cola or ‚Ç¨7 for a small tub of pringles? The bar in reception was also pricey but the service was good.

The metro is just across the road - not clearly signposted, but aim for the covered walkway in the carpark and and it is on the left. There are lifts from ground level to the platforms. The ride is around 20 mins to Espanya. 

We did use bus 46 to get back to the airport as our flight went from terminal 2. The bus stop is to the left of the hotel - ‚Ç¨2 or use a 10 trip ticket. There were night busses back to the area from the city but we did not use them.

There are some local shops nearby including a small supermarket and bakery. Turn right out of the hotel and go around to the rear of the hotel. The shops are on the left between the tower blocks access the road.

We got a good deal booking via Expedia. Not sure if we would pay the full rate due to the location. 20-30 minutes on a metro might not seem long but it does add up each day - the metro cars do have air conditioning!",4,2013,09,06
30,"Nice, but maybe too nice","We spent one night at the end of our Med cruise as part of their hotel and tour package.  We are somewhat old fashioned, but we felt all the high tech and modern look was a little over the top.  Check in was a breeze and we were upgraded to an ""executive room"".   The room was very different from what we have ever seen,but for some it would be okay.   The room is decorated in burgundy, black, chrome, and a LOT of mirrors.   We felt all the mirrors could be a safety hazrd as there were so many that you could easily walk into one thinking you were heading into a room.  The bath was quite a sight to see...all chrome, black, and mirrors.   Shower was a little interesting with all the ""executive extras"" or as we saw them, unneeded toys.  A word of caution to patrons....if you use one of the elegant bathrobes awaiting you, you WILL be charged for the use..  Eating was a problem as there was only a ""quick fix"" bar menu available, but it was good, pricey, but good.  Our problem was that we like simple and this was good for someone who likes all the bells and whistles.   Airport shuttle can be a problem.  They only send one van for about 10-12 people once an hour.   We had just come back from a cruise along with several others, so there were some who had to wait until the next trip around, so plan ahead.  When you wait for the shuttle, be first in line or you MAY not get on the one you want.....then maybe a missed flight..  It was free (just a token tip) and did a good job of arriving at the correct terminal.  This would be a 5 star for some, but I just was not totally impressed enough to give it 5 stars.",4,2013,09,03
30,Business hotel,"The room is new,good, clean and spacious. Bathroom spacious and well equip.Very comfortable overall. Metro station near by easy to get to town when needed. No mineral water or complimentary coffee or tea provided. No loan adapters need to buy at 5 euro. Good thing is free wifi in everyroom.",4,2013,09,03
30,Not worth the money!,"This hotel just isn't worth the money. It looks fancy but is an empty shell. You have to pay extra to use the pool, wakeup calls and the transfer to the airport is unreliable as the shuttle fills up quickly. 
The rooms are super modern but the service and facilities are just not unto 5 star standards!",2,2013,09,03
30,Good value but...,"The rooms were beautiful but you are a bit away from the city. They advertise their shuttle but the one to and from the airport only runs at certain times, and the shuttle to and from the city center and beach only holds 13 people. If it fills up, youre out of luck. Expensive drinks and food, breakfast 20 euro, entrance to pool, spa and gym also 20 euro. They are near a metro station though. It is located in the hospital parking lot across the road. Close to Au Pratt airport. Staff very helpful.",4,2013,09,03
30,"great hotel, nice views, modern facilities","Stayed in August, really close to the metro station, though about 15 minutes ride from Barcelona center by taxi. Metro will close to double your time getting around Barcelona (vs. taxi) - at least that's been my experience in the times I've gone.  Rooms are large, modern, staff courteous. Its just outside Barcelona city proper, but close enough to the airport and taxi services are readily available that I would come back to it again.",5,2013,09,02
30,Not worth it,"This is not a five star hotel, average at best. Very overpriced for what you're getting, same goes for the meals. You have to pay extra to use the pool ! And it's miles away from anything so you have to use the shuttle service which only operates a few services per day.
Don't waste your money here.",2,2013,09,02
30,Great Hotel,"Stayed here on a business trip, Hotel is little outside of centre of Barcelona but right next to an underground train line so make up for the deficiency of Location. The Room was spacious, clean, big toilet, wardrobe and dressing area. The room is very very well presented and this hotel is a definite recommend. I am planning to go back to Barcelona with family and would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,08,28
30,Eyes Perk Ahead,"Like Barcelona itself, this hotel is contemporary, current, slick architectural design with awesome lighting, see-through glass floor entrance, snazzy bathroom that uses top grade quality everything from paper towel to miscs sundries. Kudos to their English-speaking staff, who are well mannered and extremely helpful. Excellent shuttle service, but wish it runs more frequently. Free good WIFI signal, also offering guests fast PC and printer in the lobby. Metro & Hospital across the street. Breakfast eatery and grocery stores are 2 buildings behind hotel. We'll stay again, definitely.",5,2013,08,25
30,great hotel,"We had a very pleasant 3 night stay here in August:
Breakfast was very nice, although described as continental bacon and eggs were available. Room was very clean with great view to coast. superb shower and facilities. We would have preferred a kettle with tea n coffee making facilities to get us going in the morning.
Service was very good with multi lingual speaking staff.
Distance from Barcelona centre was about 20 minutes by Metro (tube) which was a 500 metre walk from hotel. Multi trip tickets are good value for money and the tube is easy and generally not a busy as the London underground. Hotel is ten minutes from El Prat airport, 2 euros by bus.
Wifi is available in the lounge and scant anywhere else!
The hotel had access to a sports club but our room meant we had to pay 14 euro to access it for one days use. This would have been good value but my partner wanted one swim at 7.30 in the morning so opted not to bother.
This in my opinion is a 4 star hotel with 5 star aspirations. Great hotel, I would happily stay again as long as the price was right.",4,2013,08,25
30,Good hotel but not in a good location,"Hotel in easy reach of airport (taxi roughly ‚Ç¨20) and far easier than using the metro (from the airport). Hotel is located in what is almost a derelict or semi deprived neighbourhood, but there is a metro stop 3 mins walk which is very handy.  Despite numerous comments about metro not working late, we found the metro to be fabulous and working at the weekends on a 24hr basis (very civilised). The meals in the hotel are too expensive, as you can get some very good coffe and pastries at the cafe behind the media market which is next door to the hotel (there is also a mini market and other shops available there).  The room was not available on arrival (I was really early) but the staff offered to secure bags if I wanted to go into town. The room was  a decent size, and reasonably clean. 

The air conditioning was great and much needed. The bathroom took a little getting used to, with vast mirrors and dark marble tiling.  The shower area did have signs of poor cleaning and the drains visibly showed the lack of  deep cleaning, which is a shame as this is one of the best features/facilities. As most reviews have shown the spa/gym is a separate building and incurs extra charges, which is not worth it. 

Reception area includes a lounge with easy chairs and you will often see people doing just that (being lounge lizards) the front of the hotel is tired and could do with some TLC and extra gardening/flowers. The staff were professional and helpful.",4,2013,08,25
30,Nice hotel masking a cynical swindle,"Nice hotel, wonderful staff but a real swindle. Facilities like pool and gym are charged at a daily rate of 14 euros per person per day. So a family of 4 to use the pool costs 54 euros. Oh, and if your children are under 16 they can't use the pool at all. Spend your hard-earned euros at a more reputable establishment is my advice.",2,2013,08,20
30,Surprise,"Hesperia is not just a luxury hotel. Is an experience. The beauty of the rooms and the breathtaking landscapes that you can see from the windows are amazing.
The staff is polite and kind beyond the normal five star standard (example: the Hotel left a cute cake with theyr congratulation for my girlfriend's birthday), even if we were just teenagers and no billionairs. The distance from the centre was not a big problem, because near the Hotel there is a metro stop. I candidly suggest this Hotel.

Antonio Murtas",5,2013,08,18
30,Very Good Hotel to Enjoy the Barcelona Experience,"This hotel is well situated to the south of Barcelona, not very far away from the international airport. I've travelled with my family by car, coming from Portugal, and for road travelers the hotel is very well situated near a hub highways which can take you anywhere you need. The accommodations are superb, somewhat between modern and classy, and the views from the top floors to Barcelona are amazing. I only had a couple of smaller complains: WiFi access is very very slow, not useful for anything; the parking is a fair price (9 euros per day for a car) but every time you enter or leave the building you must pass thru the reception to exchange a card. A nuisance...; finally, I don't understand why the spa and pool facilities are restricted to 18 or olders... The hotel looks like a family one, didn't understand the reason and was to shy to ask in the reception...",4,2013,08,16
30,Not what we were expecting,"This is a long review but worth a read!
I had emailed the hotel to see about transfers from the airport to the hotel to which I got a reply back with an attachment of the shuttle service. Unfortunately, our plane landed at a time which if we wanted to use their service we'd have to hang around for an hour and a half and we just wanted to get to the hotel having been up since 4am. We finally found a Metro bus which went past the hotel so we hopped on it. You can catch it in either terminal and it's the number 46, red bus, 2euro's each. 
Arrived to be told our room wasn't ready which was fine as it was only 1030ish so shown the underground Metro map and the route to take to get into the city...the Metro is a God send if you're staying here!! Came back at 3ish wanting to freshen up to be told our room wasn't ready but we could have a twin room and push the beds together (we are a married couple so turned it down). We waited in the lobby and I asked half an hour if not longer if our room was ready to which we were told it was and we wondered if they'd have eventually come to tell us or left us sitting there...we think the latter of the 2!
Room was lovely but no tea and coffee making facillities, iron and ironing board (there's a charge to use theirs) and a VERY expensive mini bar. Small bottle of water 6 euro's, chocolate bars 6 or 7 euro's. Thank goodness for the garage at the side of the hotel or the little shop in amongst the blocks of flats which are right next to the hotel (the pics they didn't show us on the websites!!). The views aren't of Barcelona, on one side you have the airport and dual carriage way, the side we stayed on is of local flats, factories, hospital and the docks.
Had a shower and put the jets on as they were powerful but they flooded the toilet room so couldn't use the power part again. The shower floor is slippy too so be careful!
No local places to eat that we found although one of their restaurant's around the corner is shut during August, don't know why though. The restaurant at the top of the hotel is also closed. We ended up going to Barcelona each night to eat which is 15-20 mins on the shuttle bus which leaves at 1820 and returns at 2000. It only has 13 seats so you have to be there about 1800 to make sure you get on it, otherwise it's the Metro.
There is also no pool, it's in the leisure centre which is used for the public and 14 euro's a day and you have to wear a swimming cap each time so not the relaxing chill out pool you'd expect to find in a 5* hotel and have to be over 16 to use!
Wifi, although free is very slow and the computer in the lobby is for business customers only.
Carpets need a good cleaning and some need replacing.
They could do with another shuttle bus as most journeys are to/from the airport. The lady that drives it is lovely and likes to open and close the door for you, I think she got abit offended when someone had opened the door to get out.
We felt the hotel and staff didn't promote Barcelona to tourists, we found things ourselves by using the metro and by looking at the tour bus route map. 
I can honestly say that we won't be staying here again as stayed in other 5* with all the missing facilities this hotel didn't have.",3,2013,08,13
30,"Modern, Nice, Classy Hotel",NCL Cruise line recommended this hotel for us to stay the day before our Mediterranean cruise. Great Choice in regards to accomodations. This hotel is a little far from the city center but we were able to take a cab downtown to see the sites. The hotel is very clean and the rooms were very nice and modern. We spent a little late night time one night at the bar and it would've been nice if they would've had appetizers or snacks to serve to guests. Overall this was a great hotel b/c we had no idea what we've be up against in Spain in regards to the area or the accommodations. I'll stay here again when we go back to Barcelona.,4,2013,08,08
30,Fantastic,"When first arriving at the hotel I was blown away by the lay out and design; it is beautifully decorated, the staff were very friendly and helpful and offered me assistance whenever I required it. 

It just so happened that my birthday landed right in the middle of my stay, without me asking or informing any of the hotel staff, I got back to my room and waiting for me was a delicious cake with a lovely note wishing me happy birthday. I thought this was a really nice gesture and couldn't thank them enough. 

The hotel location is a little out of the way but if you don't mind sitting down on the metro for 20-25 minutes you'll have no issue as the hotel is located just a 2 minute walk from the nearest metro stop. 

Overall I found the general atmosphere and experience amazing, would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody ***** .",5,2013,08,08
30,Hesperia Tower,"We had stayed in Hesperia for four nights. 
The reception staff were helpful, who all spoke excellent English. 
The atmosphere in the bar area was lovely; the barman Edwin Fuster from Peru was incredibly nice, with good manners and excellent communication skills. The service was top shelf.
Breakfast buffet was amazing; you don't need anything else until dinner!  The staff in the buffet was very polite and friendly. One morning we were served at breakfast by a very pleasant young gentleman in a suit he paid a lot of attention to the needs of guests.
Room and facilities were very good also really clean.  The cleaning Lady from Nigeria on the 8 floor was very charming we enjoyed seeing her smile every morning, it lifted our mood.",4,2013,08,06
30,Short Honeymoon Break - Very Enjoyable,"I and my new wife stayed at Hesparia Tower Hotel for 3 nights between 29th July & 1st August 2013. It was our second visit to the city and hotel, having stayed there for a similar length of time about 4 years ago. And we weren‚Äôt disappointed at all.

We chose Barcelona as a city break honeymoon as we were charmed at what the city offers ‚Äì having the best of both worlds with shops, markets, beach, harbour, food etc and with a little one at home we needed somewhere that was a short trip from the UK. We had no hesitation in returning to this lovely hotel. Although maybe designed more for business travellers, the reception accommodated our touristy needs with ease and for my sins all staff spoke very clear English to help a typical Brit out!

What was most enjoyable about our stay before was the room ‚Äì the bed, the comfort and the power showers. We were lucky enough to have an equally comfortable stay but after mentioning it was our honeymoon when booking the reception placed us on the nice side (views wise) as from the 10th floor we had a clear view over the city with the sea tucked in the background. This view is particularly lovely at night time. We knew the location of the hotel was more suited to be closer to airport than the main downtown therefore were surrounding by a motorway (or large dual carriageway)  but despite this the local area although not overly lively didn‚Äôt make you think you were that close to the main roads.

We arrived about ¬æ hours before normal check in but only had to wait about half hour to check in early which was a bonus and once we headed out and returned that evening we were pleasantly surprised and shocked that there was complimentary champagne on ice, strawberries dipped in chocolate, roses on the bed and candles. Along with a note from the hotel manager congratulating us on getting married and hoping we enjoy this stay with them. What a touch we both thought and then sipped on champagne overlooking the lovely night time views.

It irritates me that people below have negative comments about the hotel. Fair enough if you have received bad service but moaning that it is too far from downtown or having to pay for the spa that is on the side of the hotel. Surely you research where you are planning on staying before you travel? Just looking at the underground map it is clear it is a view stops from the main part ‚Äì even though its only about 20 mins on the tube and the hotel offers complimentary shuttle services throughout the day downtown and to the beach and airports. The website of Hesparia Tower also clearly advertises this so using comments against the hotel like this hardly seems fair. If you wish to have a free spa or be closer town ‚Äì pay to go to one of those hotels!

I haven‚Äôt been to many 5* hotels granted but there is nothing other than 5* service that we received whilst staying. The only thing we didn‚Äôt try was the breakfast or restaurants which was our own personal preference. Just because we aren‚Äôt seafood people and the main restaurants offers several dishes accommodating that I would never hold that against them.

Anyhow a lovely trip, a lovely visit and I‚Äôm sure we will return again, maybe with our little one and would have no hesitation at returning to this hotel.",5,2013,08,06
30,So so....,"Stayed here in August 2013. Rooms were okay, not 5 star clean. Showers over filled, no toiletries! Under 18's can't use pool or spa facilities, very expensive room service, middle of nowhere, about 15minutes from rambla, need a taxi around 15 euros each way. However cheapest 5 star in Barcelona now I know why! Tower at top is a function suite, not a restaurant with views! Metro is close by around 300m but doesn't stay open late during week. The beach at Gava is sensational and clean. Hotel offers a shuttle to city, airport and beach but only has 13 seats, so if you are not fast you are last and may need to book the taxi anyway! Would I stay again...if I was skint! ",3,2013,08,05
30,Great hotel in a great city,"Everything you could expect as a business man or tourist from a 5 star hotel. From the facilities to the services that Hesperia provides, everything is at the highest quality level.

30,"Great for business, fair for tourists","I stayed here for 3 nights in July 2013.

Pros: 
- Lobby and seating area very clean, modern, comfortable. 
- The room was very nice. Good bed, fancy/modern shower and bathroom area
- Good wifi connection
- Coldest AC we encountered in Spain!!
- Free shuttle that runs to and from the airport, Gava beach, and Placa Catalunya several times a day
- Metro stop a 2 minute walk away
- Phenomenal breakfast buffet spread
- Reasonable base price
- Super nice, helpful staff that speak multiple languages well
- Free luggage storage

Cons:
- Not much included in the price of the room...
- Breakfast buffet not included and expensive (15 a person)
- Fitness center/pool/spa not included and expensive (14 per day)
- No irons, but you can use the ironing service for a fee...
- Restaurants very expensive... cheapest items on the menu (sandwiches/salads) are 15-17 Euros
- Not a good location for tourists. Not in walking distance to anything",4,2013,08,02
30,Terrible location and unprofessional. Not good value.,"I would not recommend this hotel in Barcelona to tourists. It has a terrible location, the hotel (at least the rooms) seems worn down and the staff is inexperienced. You can do better. 

I stayed here for two nights in July and it was not a good choice if you are visiting Barcelona as a tourist. The hotel is in an industrial center far away from the city center. Getting into town will take you 30mins with bus/subway and 15mins with a taxi. 

The Hotel has little personality and does not feel like home, feels more like an office complex.  The room I stayed in was decent but worn down with several leaks in bathroom, and was really in need of an upgrade. The breakfast buffet impressed, well stocked and delicious, but it had to many staff/waiters hovering over you, that made me bit uncomfortable. 

Suggestions to the management: When a guest checks in and the first he meets is a big water leakage from the bathroom ceiling, I recommend you find the guest a new room, than a get a technician and cleaning staff to work on the room with the newly checked guest waiting. 
Perhaps you should look up the word professional.",2,2013,08,02
30,"We booked for the convenience, and were pleasantly surprised!","When we booked this hotel, we were looking for a location with quick access to the airport, with easy access to downtown. There is a free shuttle from the airport, and the Metro stop is a 5 minute walk away. The Metro is easy to use, safe, and inexpensive. 

The surprise was this was a very nice hotel, full of nice features! High tech showers in the bath, interesting architecture (the 'flying saucer' restaurant on top is now closed), and glass floors exposing interesting underground features in the elevator lobby. Frankly, unlike some other reviewers, we found the staff to be most helpful and polite!

There isn't anything in the immediate area, however the gas station next door does include a small convenience store, good for snacks and beverages..

The free shuttle operates on a set schedule, without any runs between 12:20 and 5:00 P.M. If that is when you land a taxi to the hotel is about 20 euros. You can take the Metro, but there isn't a direct line.",5,2013,08,02
30,GREAT HOTEL!,"This hotel was fabulous!  Stayed here on the final leg of a three week trip to Europe.  Was very comfortable, clean and rested really well.  Very unique, up to date and modern.  Had a shuttle bus that took you into town and picked you up so that was very nice to save money on a cab into the city.  Shuttle took us to the airport when we departed.  Everything was great.  Would stay again!",5,2013,07,31
30,Luxury hotel with a splendid view,"Fantastic hotel with fantastic view over a part of the Barcelona. The staff is very helpful and speak perfect English. Very good connections to the city centre with metro station nearby. I will be there next year, too.

30,Very quirky hotel full of surprises! Staff poorly trained.,"The outside of this hotel looks very industrial,as you walk in you notice lots of unusual seating in the foyer, contemporary plush lay flat on your back cubes, flying saucer seats....a big drinks bar and a reception that doesn't look like a conventional reception!
All this and I haven't even reached the bedroom yet!
The lifts require you to use a touch-screen destination control system.
As soon as you enter your room that shiny floor theme from the lobby continues and you struggle to work out what is a wall and what is a door, you begin by touching everything to work out what it is. Everything is either black or glass or chrome and the bathroom is open plan with wardrobe doors and toilet/shower doors all looking alike. Even inside the wardrobe is mirrored.
The shower has horizontal water jets as well as rainshower head and the glass wall that separates this from the toilet becomes the light.
The towels are fantastic, thick and heavy. Now for the things I DID NOT LIKE: 
As soon as I sat down on the bed I found a big black hair on the sheet! Yuk. The bed linen was not the best quality, certainly the worst out of all 5 Spanish hotels on this trip. 
I hated the complimentary toiletries, gaudy greens and orange with sickly fruit aromas. Couldn't even use the soap. This is a first for me.
Lastly, had a very bad experience with our room service order, the chips were not cooked properly and still hard inside,I complained and someone came to the room and she picked up a chip and squashed it between her fingers and said "" to me that is cooked"" to which I said "" I am not stupid"".
It was taken away and we were brought a replacement and were given some complimentary fruit salad which helped to make up for that rude insinuation. 
Breakfast was faultless with yet more giggle inducing designs. Coffee was poured by dedicated coffee pourers, that's what I call civilised.",4,2013,07,30
30,Home to the US,"My wife and I visited this hotel in July 2013. As we drove up it looked space age. I was expecting to see George Jetson and his dog arrive by space coach. On to the hotel. A real step up for hotels near an airport. Check in was fast. Lobby and seating area very clean and orderly. The room was very nice.Good bed, shower, internet connection, cold AC, no American TV channels. We went down to the bar and had Tapas and Cerveche. Very nice. They provide a free shuttle to the airport. This my friends is a 27 Euro benefit as opposed to taking a cab. Great place. Would stay here anytime I am flying out of Barcelona. A funny note: The nice girl at the desk told us at check in that breakfast was 25 Euros per person or if we booked the night before we could get a special deal of 15 Euros per person. Converted into USD that would be $34.00 or the special deal of $20.00 per person for breakfast. It is safe to say we had breakfast at the Delta lounge at the airport. Spain's breakfast are expensive and not very good. This entire Country needs to touch base with breakfast reality. Ole'",5,2013,07,30
30,Great Modern Hotel,"I loved this hotel and it's design. The staff was very friendly and the rooms are absolutely beautiful. There's only a couple of downers about it. 
1. The area where it is located is really really bad and sketchy, unless you fancy a jaunt in the ghettos of Barcelona. 
2. Nothing near it what so ever.
3. The shuttle service to and fro the airport is very minimal. Don't listen to there website. If you have an early morning, late evening flight, or mid afternoon (siesta time) flight, you can forget about the shuttle service. 
Otherwise, it's good for an over night connector.",3,2013,07,27
30,"Nice hotel with poor service, thin walls","I have stayed in this hotel for 12 nights in a standard room. Bed was firm, which is very good and the shower was modern and with different shower head/massage. But I found the front desk staff not very polite or helpful, I have lost my bank card in the hotel and nobody was able to give me any message about it. I of course canceled my card although I didnt have to, because while I was checking out from the hotel, I got my card back. Would have been smarter if they left me a message that they found it. Wifi connection was very poor all the time, I rather borrowed a connection cable. The location  - 16mins by metro to Espanya, 25 minutes to Catalunya. Well, quiet place but far from the city. The pool is not a part of the hotel, its a independent gym/pool connected to the hotel. Fitness studio/spa costs 14‚Ç¨, plus additional 2‚Ç¨ for swimming cap. Breakfast are not as good as they seem at first sight. Good selection of fruits, almost no vegetables. Good selection of sweet pastry, but no bread. Ciabbata and toasts only. And one more thing - the walls in room are rather thin, man can hear neighbours speaking. Average and good designed hotel.",3,2013,07,25
30,Amazing hotel,"We splurged out on a luxury suite. The suit was AMAZING! You could probably fit 10 people in the shower and five in the hot tub. The room was clean and had an amazing view from the 12th floor.

The hotel was a 10-15 minute drive from the hotel which was great. There was also a Metro station 5 minutes walk away, making it easy to get around to all the tourist attractions.

The hotel was modern, staff were friendly and the breakfast was lovely.

Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2013,07,22
30,Budget 5* (!?),"There charge very reasonable prices at this super clean and modern hotel. It's a bit of a trip from the city centre (who cares though - it's just time sitting down on the train...) but very close to the Metro station. The staff are friendly and helpful, and speak decent English. Lots of the features that make it 5* have additional costs associated with them.",5,2013,07,20
30,Great hotel,"Not the best 5* hotel we have tried, but we can not complain very much. If you go here for the swimming pool you will be disappointed. It's a ""health"" club connected to the hotel, and perfect for business trips and people with bigger children (16+) Great fitness studio.
The end station of the metro is right next to the hotel and very convenient to go down town if you don't take the free hotel shuttle which we used to go to the beach and airport too. All in all a great hotel but location could be better.",4,2013,07,20
30,"Lovely hotel, but a ways out of town","We stayed at Hesperia Tower for 5 nights in the summer season. We chose this hotel because it was 5* (maybe only deserves 4* but still good) and still reasonably priced. The hotel itself is very nice and the rooms are lovely, but it is a 30 minute metro ride out of town (metro station is a 5 min walk away from hotel). That said, a similar hotel at the beach in Barcelona would have increased the total price of our trip by a factor of 5.
The good things: The hotel itself is beautiful and has a very modern interior. There is a bar on the opposite side of the reception desk and dozens of seats. There are four elevators that take you up to the floor your room is on. Two of the elevators have unfrosted glass so you can take in the view on the ride up. 
We had an odd numbered room and so faced the hospital nearby and the airport. Not the best view but we did get to see a helicopter land and take off from the hospital helipad. The rooms themselves are immaculately clean and spacious. The curtains are truly black out curtains; my husband and I slept in until 10am every day! The curtains are motorized, which took us a while to figure out; there is an open and a close button for them next to the bed.
King size bed is super comfortable and doesn't seem to transfer motion at all.
The bathroom has two sinks and a fantastic shower and a separate toilet cubicle. There is an abundance of mirrors and that led to me walking straight into the closet door when I first got there and then again when I thought I was going into another closet.
A couple small let downs: we never found tea/coffee making facilities in the room, the bar seems to shut a bit early, and you can't go to the semispherical room at the top that used to be a restaurant. We were also a bit put off that it cost an additional 14euro each to use the pool (which we declined).
I highly recommend this hotel as long as you aren't put off by a metro or taxi ride to and from each day. We had five day transport passes and so the only restraint was the operating hours of the metro (only runs til midnight Sun-Thurs).
To get to hotel from the airport: hop on bus 46, get off at the first stop then turn around and you can see it to the right. From there its a ten minute walk along pedestrian paths. To get to the Hospital de Bellvitge metro stop: walk out the hotel doors and head to the right to cross the roundabout. Walk diaganol across the parking lot where you will see the post with the metro ""M"" on it. For hardcore sightseeing, get either a BarcelonaCard or Hola Barcelona metro pass.",4,2013,07,17
30,Luxury business hotel,"Stayed here for one week, on a semi business, semi personal trip. Booked with a deal online. 
Overall look of the hotel is luxurious and modern. Rooms were a little bit worn with scratches and not so fresh looking sofa's. Location is not the best, on a big intersection sandwiched between two hospitals. Time to the pl. catalunya by metro is approx. 30 minutes.
Service at the desk is very good, the staff are true problem solvers. The only unfriendly person was the female manager of the restaurant during breakfast. Somehow we didn't appear on the breakfast 'list' one morning and she made a big deal out of it and said we had to leave without offering any explanation. We didn't make a big deal of it and went upstairs, where one of her staff came to get us and told us there had been a mistake. The breakfast has a good variety but is basically a standard continental breakfast. The scrambled eggs had a weird taste and the pancakes were unedible. The rest was okay. The coffee and tea choices were excellent. The hotel room had no coffee/ tea facilities, which was strange for a 5*. 
The spa and swimming pool are located next to the hotel and it is only included with some of the suites and executive rooms (and even then often just for one day). It is part of the Metropolitan chain and seems to be frequented by a lot of locals. It was very busy when we visited. Good selection of machines (Technogym). The spa was the kind of spa you see in gyms, not the relaxing kind. Big pool for swimming laps, where swimming caps were obligatory. Flipflops are also obligatory and can be bought at the desk. There is a sunning area outside the spa with some beds. All in all I think the pool/ spa are too expensive for what you get and way too crowded.
Shuttle times to the city and airport are very limited. We have not been able to use them once during the entire week.
During our stay our AC was fixed and our safe was fixed. After that, I noticed 50euro missing, which I had left in the safe. I asked about it at the desk and they sent someone upstairs but didn't do anything about it. 
The shower was fantastic and a highlight of the room. Wifi only worked sporadically and very slow, which was a definite drawback during a business trip.
All in all, an enjoyable relaxing stay. Breakfast, spa access and wifi could use an upgrade.",4,2013,07,14
30,Not a great location,"Having said this don't let this totally put you off. The hotel was obviously the company's flagship, however it would seem that not a lot has been done to upgrade the hotel in the last 6/7 years since it's opening. The d√©cor although pleasant is looking worn. We stayed in a suite, the room was spacious and the jacuzzi bath was lovely. The staff we friendly and helpful, however the lifts broke 5 minutes after we arrived...not great. The tower club was great for the continental breakfast, afternoon coffee and cakes or an evening glass! 
It's five minutes walk to the nearest train station Hospital de Bellvitge, and a 25 minute train journey into Catalunya, the busy area on the Rambla Catalunya, this adds quite a lot to a day. Dinner at the Bouquet Restaurant was enjoyable and reasonable value for money and the choice was varied. The WiFi was very hit and miss too.",4,2013,07,13
30,"A Bit Far from the Centre, But Worth the Money","I stayed at the Hesperia Tower in Barcelona, Spain, from July 12 - 14, and I have to admit I was pleased with my choice. The only real problem is the location, which is a bit far from the city center, so cabbing it downtown was the most sane option. Somewhat expensive, but worth factoring into a travel budget. 

Pros: The room I had was absolutely beautiful. I traveled solo, so I had more than enough space to feel relaxed. If I could've packed the shower set-up in my bag and taken it home, I would've tried. Also, the bed was more comfortable than the one I have at home. I especially appreciated the professional and friendly service I received from reception and at Bar Axis (thanks, Beta!). The staff answered all of my questions and gave some great advice re where to go and how to get there. 

Cons: The only problems that I had with Hesperia were the super-slow WiFi connection (might as well have been dial-up) and the high price of food and drinks. A sandwich and two drinks cost me 42 euros. That, to me, is a crime. 

Other than that, I was happy. If I find my way back to Barcelona in the near future, I'll probably stay closer to Barcelona Sants (the train station) just for the convenience. But if I'm driving, I'll definitely keep Hesperia in mind.",4,2013,07,13
30,Relaxing modern hotel. Good service.,"This hotel was great overall.  I arrived before 10am and they had a room ready for me.  The desk staff was multilingual, helpful and courteous,  The room was modern, comfortable, extremely clean, and posh.
The only comment I would have for someone looking to spend lots of time in Barcelona is, the hotel is a 15-20 minute subway ride from City Center.  It is the last stop on the 1 red line.  It is very close to the airport, but I did not hear any plane noise.  Complimentary airport shuttle took 10 minutes to the airport.

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,07,12
30,Dissapointed,"Wifi didnt work, taxi to the airport was not called, room service food was not great but very expensive. Some areas of the hotel furnishings starting to look worn. Stayed here a few years ago but wont stay again.",1,2013,07,10
30,A little more service,"I stayed here on business recently. Overall an ok stay. 

Positives - nice rooms (although really dark bathrooms!) and the aircon works great. Comfortable beds. 

Negatives - slow and reluctant service in the restaurants, VERY expensive drinks and Xmas comes faster than the elevators!",3,2013,07,09
30,A,"both double rooms and apartments are cozy and clean. we had to switch from a double room to apartment: everything went smoothly, but we had to take care of our luggage at transit
very good food, but not as expected
no cofee or tea facilities in the room",4,2013,07,08
30,Nice Rooms but...,"Firstly, the bedrooms were very nice, interesting design and the iphone compatable clock radio was a nice touch. However, the service, especially in the bar area left a lot to be desired. 5 euro for a bottle of beer is not cheap but it is a 5 star hotel. However, serving it warm after a 20 mins wait is not. If you want to use the pool it is 14 euro extra which is a disgrace. Breakfast was lukewarm and they ran out of eggs 2 of the 4 days I stayed. A very strange arrangement with calling the lifts meant a 20 mins wait at peak times. The staffing levels looked to be cut to the bone and all of the staff looked both harassed and under pressure. Hotel is a fair way out although this was known before we booked. All in all a long way from a UK standard 5 star hotel...",3,2013,07,08
30,Hesperia Tower - Business Hotel,"The good: The view.

The not so good: 
Windows need cleaning to see the view. 

Needs a reform already. Mirrors cracked, cleaning needs a better regimen, dirty in places. No drink facilities to make tea/coffee. There is an outside terrace for coffee at reception, but personnel weren't prepared to bring it & just said there wasn't an outside terrace to save them trouble. Reception staff pleasant enough, but obviously in it for the money, not for the job. Avoided modern hotels in the past... this experience will help in the future. A hotel in the middle of nowhere, transport needed for everything as not well located (even though it looks that way on the map). Didn't even bother using the (prepaid) breakfast/restaurant if the cleanliness in the room was like this. Rooms quiet enough, but the soundproofing doesn't extend to the room door, where loud bangs are heard throughout the night with people coming & going & air pressure causing this noise - quite an easy fix as well. 

Some of the Spa facilities don't function (i.e. sauna + other amenities) - no mention of this when paying at hotel reception! Cap not needed in Spa, spa staff turn a blind eye.

A new surprise at the end with ""city tax"" at 4.50‚Ç¨ per person.

Give yourself 5 - 10 minutes before you have your first shower in the room... You'll need a manual to work out how it functions.

Would I stay here again? Nope!",2,2013,07,07
30,Hotel is OK - A long way fro the action though,"Recently stayed here for a business conference. The hotel was nice, with some interesting touches in the design, although I felt that they could have broken up some of the black tiles to give a bit of variety.

Generally staff were helpful, although they didn't come across as particularly warm - you got the sense that they were doing their job, rather than wanting to make the guest experience as good as possible.

If you want to get to the centre of the city, the metro takes about 25-30 minutes. If you are going somewhere that will involve you changing trains though, you may well find that its quicker (although a bit more expensive) to get a taxi there instead.

The hotel bar is ok, but the drinks are very pricey - they take advantage of the fact that there are no other late night bars nearby.

Lifts can be very slow - particular in the mornings when there are events on & everyone wants to use them at the same time. If you are on the lower levels, the lifts will be full when they reach you, so you will need to wait even longer.

Views from the building are amazing, although its a shame that the restaurant / bar on the top level appears to be no longer operational (other reviews have mentioned the same thing, going back for a couple of years now).

Checking out process was faster (for me) than at other similar events I've been to, although there was still quite a large queue there.",3,2013,07,01
30,Nice quality,"We stayed at the Hesperia Tower for a night between getting off our ship and spending a week in Sitges, the hotel is nice, modern, easy parking, and what looked like a great dome on the top! However all but 1 restaurant was closed, we couldnt get to the top to see the views as the lifts would not allow it, in the end we got a taxi into Barcelona for some dinner. The room was smart, lovely dressing - bathroom area, luxury bedding, fantastic views! Great price for such nice quality, would definitely recommend if you need a stop over - too far out of Barcelona for walking - 13 euro cab ride in.",4,2013,07,01
30,Good airport hotel but let down by the transportation,"We had a 1 night stay as a transit between our domestic and international flights, and this seemed a reasonable option as an airport hotel.  Its location was not optimal, it was a bit far from the airport (a taxi ride from the airport took 20 minutes and 18 euro), and as others have written, it is on the last metro stop from the city.

The room was not as spacious as expected for a triple room, although adequate.  Lots of drapes and fabric-lined walls made it a bit dark and gloomy.  But the bathroom was definitely the star - lots of mirrors everywhere, with drawers and a small cupboard in the bathroom to put clothes and stuff.  Breakfast was provided at the Tower Club.

The biggest let down was the airport shuttle.  When we arrived, we had to walk a long distance to Parking area G where the shuttle was supposed to pick up. There was no sign to indicate the location and timing, and after a while, we gave up and took a taxi.

The timings were irregular and infrequent, as they use the same van to run a shuttle service into the city, so between 9:20 am and 5 pm, there is only 1 trip to the airport at 11:20 am (See timings below). So if you are going on a flight leaving between 11 am to 7 pm, you probably would need to take a taxi.  So take note of the following timings to be able to plan your transfer.

The shuttle timings from hotel to airport are : 0720, 0800, 0840, 0920, 1120, 1700, 1820, 1940 hrs.

The pickup times from the airport parking area G to hotel are : 0740, 0820, 0900, 0940, 1140, 1720, 1840, 2000 hrs.

The other bad thing was that the shuttle bus had a limited capacity of 13 people.  Even though we were at the front of the hotel 20 minutes before the bus was due, there was already a queue. But there seemed to be enough space still, until the bus arrived and other travellers came out from the hotel as some of their group were already in the queue and kept places for them. So we had no choice but to take our return trip to the hotel by taxi again.",4,2013,06,30
30,Stayed here as airport hotel but would not recommend it at all,"We did not stay here to be in Barcelona. We stayed here at end if our one month trip in Spain and as we flew back to Barcelona arriving late afternoon and leaving next morning we decided to stay one night near airport and this hotel had free airport shuttle. We decided to book executive room as it said it had access to club room so we could have refreshments at night and it said they had continental breakfast in the morning. Firstly the airport shuttle is not what one expects from five star hotel and once full that's it. On arrival nobody offered to take our bags. The receptionist was completely unhelpful. She said we didn't have breakfast included and I was double checking papers as I thought it said we have club room access with continental breakfast. She mentioned nothing about facilities of hotel or that we had club room access with our room and it is only in fine print. On arrival into the room the decor is extremely brown and dark not like the pictures. Dark brown bed cover, dark curtains, dark marone walls, dark brown carpet, black bathroom with mirrors just all dark. The carpet was completely stained everywhere and cleanliness of hotel in general was average.  Executive rooms had no info about facilities in them, nothing about club room. We went to club room floor and it said access for club tower members only. There was no staff on the whole floor. We rang reception from the phone and checked that it was included in our room and they said it was. Compared to other hotels club room was average especially in terms of food. There was nobody there probably because they are not told about it. After we left and came back for another drink a few hours later out plates were still there, ie. they don't staff it and nobody checks what room you are in. Later that night a group came in and it was evident that they knew it was not manned. We expected to have breakfast there in the morning as it said they had continental breakfast only to find it is closed and only opens at 8am. We were due to leave to the airport at 8! What kind of place that advertises itself as an airport hotel doesn't open until 8am? The room had information about the gym saying it costs 14 euros extra to use it. This is ridiculous after paying 200 euros for a room in a supposedly five star hotel. Only after I left did I realise that it is meant to be included with executive room yet no info was provided by reception and one needs token to get in there and our room info said it costs 14 euros. There was only one restaurant open and the bar on ground floor with same menu. The food is a rip off for Spain. We just ordered two salads as we were not that hungry and can't go wrong with salad. It was truly awful and was 31 euros for two terrible salads. I would not recommend this hotel at all even for one night stay. The value for money is poor as is the service. For those staying here to be in Barcelona rather than an airport hotel it is really better to be in town, and for the same price bit better places. I don't think this place can call itself am airport hotel. They need to learn from many other airport hotels. Having a nice lobby and that's it isn't what makes a good hotel.",2,2013,06,28
30,What a delight,"We booked not really knowing where the hotel was in relation to the centre of Barcelona - silly perhaps, but the metro station is a short walk - 5mins from the hotel (buy a T10 ticket to travel around the city centre) and the metro ride is 22 mins to Catalu√±a.  Hotel was lovey, as was our room.  Didn't use the pool and spa facilities as these were an additional cost.  Local area quiet as residential but within a short walk we found cafes, bars, shops and markets.  

Concierge always greeted us with a smile and an Hola, reception staff friendly and helpful.
Our room was fabulous and given the trip was to mark my sisters 50th birthday, it was a great surprise to arrive back after a busy sight seeing day to find the hotel had laid out drinks, cake and a card to mark the occasion. A very unexpected and pleasant surprise.

Thoroughly enjoyed our week at this hotel and would recommend, probably not for the young looking for a 'party' time mind..",4,2013,06,26
30,What a treat,"We stayed at the Hesperia Towers as a birthday treat and it was well worth it, we had a basic room but it was far from basic it was lovely there wasn't a thing I would change the staff were lovely and gave us hints about using the metro. The hotels transfer service into Barcelona and like wise to the airport was fantastic the lady who drove most of the time was lovely, friendly and helpful.  The metro is about 100m in front of the hotel with the entrance being in the hospital car park look for the glass box with an M written on it.  There is also a lift down to the metro if you have mobility problems.  ",5,2013,06,24
30,"Nice rooms, no location for tourists","I stayed at Hepseria Tower Hotel for a 3 day congress.
Overall, the hotel is very modern. Rooms are very comfortable, Aircondition working properly. But to be honest, if the congress would not have been in the same buidling, I would not stay there again, ugly area, no restaurants around and subway to downtown Barcelona takes 30 minutes.

Pro's:
Very nice lobby a¬¥nd rooms
Easy access to airport
If you don't mind public transport, subway to the city is ust 10 minutes walk away
Free hotel shuttle to downtown and airport, but very seldom running and no reservation possible, if the 13 seats are taken, you have to call a taxi

Con's:
Area around the hotel is really nasty, nothing to do
To go to restaurants and bars you need the subway
Elevator system not capable with lots of congress participants, sometimes you have to wait for 20 minutes
hallways on the floors are not airconditioned
The pool is situated in a public fitness center, hotel charges 10 Euros daily and you have to wear a swimming cap (!!!)

Overall, not a bad hotel, although it looks really ugly from the outside, not too bad inside. If you get a good rate and don't mind to take subway to the center, not a bad choice. Would highly recommend a hotel in a more central location if you visit Barcelona as a tourist",3,2013,06,24
30,AVOID THIS HOTEL,"Stayed at Hesperia Tower for 12 nights in June 2013

Pros 
- Aesthetically pleasing
- Lovely coffees from the pleasant bar staff
- 5 minute walk to metro station

- Upgraded to a suite when we said we wanted a refund to move to a Holiday Inn (that would be less than half the price with the same facilities and treatment), we also were given a free bottle of water to say sorry (strange)

Cons 
- Over 40 minutes from the main part of Barcelona and longer to beaches
- Only 2 out of the 5 advertised restaurants were open, restaurant Evo has been closed for over a year. We were not notified, had to fine out when going to book a table at a non-existent restaurant! There are NO bars and restaurants in the area of the hotel so had to travel to another part of Barcelona all of the time to eat as the restaurant and bar that were available were ridiculously priced (¬£23 for cheese and tomato pizza, ¬£9 for a pot of English breakfast tea!!)
- Spa and swimming poor are NOT included - $14 each per day extra and the saunas and some other equipment did not even work
- No kettle/ tea/ coffee in rooms
- Only English TV channel is the news
- Air Con is REALLY noisy
- Walls are paper thin so we could here everything from people living on the same corridor, had many sleepless nights from hearing everything from others in the hotel
- The cleaners took one of our electricity cards from the room for some reason, so when my partner was out at the bar and I was in the room I could not use hairdryer etc (therefore could not get ready), also could not charge my phone therefore he could not contact me to see where I was - extremely inconvenient 
- NOT ONCE were we greeted by hotel staff, they were rude and acted like we were not staying at the hotel - I have read reviews that they were racist, I can confirm that they are also ageist!
- In the first room the shower leaked all over the floor, we had to use all the towels so that the bedroom did not get flooded each time we had a shower, the jets on the shower were broken or missing, light bulbs didn't work and a shelf was broken!

Summary - Me and my partner have both stayed all over the world in 5 star hotels, I would rate this hotel as a 3 star at the most. It is 100% not a hotel to stay at for 'leisure' purposes, and I would not be happy staying there for business with the ridiculous prices and the false hope of a 5 star stay. I must also add that I have not mentioned everything that we were not happy with, just the things that I can remember whilst writing this review!

Most importantly I would like to mention that I do not like to complain and never have had to about a hotel before, as the many other 5 stars I have stayed in have lived up to their expectations!!",1,2013,06,21
30,"Great Hotel, Out of the City","Stayed here for four nights to attend a conference in the adjacent conference centre.
Room was very comfortable, bathroom takes a bit of getting used to, as it's a ""hall of mirrors"".

Food was also good in the Bouguet Restaurant (unfortunately the rooftop Evo retsaurant was closed during my stay, views from the 26th floor must be excellent).

Hotel is about 5 km from the Airport, and it is possible to get into the city centre in about 20 minutes by metro nearby.",4,2013,06,21
30,What a great hotel!,Beds are comfortable. Pillows are nice. It is a very new hotel with lovely rooms. The staff were so nice and helpful. Would not stay anywhere else and the breakfast is fantastic. A little out of town but very close to the metro and easy to use. Close to the airport also.,5,2013,06,19
30,"Brilliant, very modern hotel and very helpful staff","My sister and I booked a living social deal to this hotel for two nights, fri and sat. It was a great experience and we had a deluxe room. It's rated as a four star hotel and it was very nice. Nothing like any hotel I have been to before. The staff were very nice and extremely helpful with anything we asked, from directions to making bookings at restaurants for us ! The only down side is that it was on the outskirts of Barcelona, not in the centre, but there is a metro station opposite ( and across a car park, approx 5 mins walk ) We enjoyed getting about on the metro, we bought a ticket that was for ten uses and one of us would go through the barrier and then pass it to the other to get through. Very good value !",5,2013,06,16
30,C'est magnifique....,"Recently stayed at the hotel for three nights and found it to be an absolute delight.

Firstly, I have to give a mention to two members of staff on reception who helped set the tone for our whole stay:  Ana Rocio and Esteban (an Espanyol fan....I never said he was perfect!)

Both Ana Rocio and Esteban were ever so helpful and patient as we made plans for our stay so I would highly recommend you approach them or any other member of staff who I'm sure would be just as helpful....I'd go back just for them!

On to the other stuff:

Here is what I liked in some kind of order:

- Hotel is around a 15-20 minute drive from the El Prat airport
- 15 minute drive to La Rambla almost straight down Gran Via
- 10 minute drive to Port Olimpic area
-  Llobregat was fine too especially some of the local restaurants....not sure what everyone complains about...it's a residential area!
- Entrance and reception had the wow factor
- Check in was smooth and a room on the highest floor possible was provided...excellente!
- The lifts were amazing....you'll know what I'm talking about when you experience it ;)
- Rooms were large and spacious...the use of the mirrors in the suite area was clever.  The floor-to-ceiling windows were a delight as it afforded a super view of the surrounding area.
- Electric blinds were a nice touch.
- Shower was amazing especially when the jets were on....so fresh and so clean ;)
- Soft-touch drawers
- nice toileteries
- room service which left the rooms very clean
- pleasant staff all round 

Can't comment on the breakfast as we rolled in super late every night....however, for those of you who are early birds, it is available for ‚Ç¨16 per person if ordered the day before.

Things that could be added to enhance the stay even more:

- secure parking for free....it is far enough out of Barcelona to offer such an option
- the Evo on the top floor to be open
- complimentary teas and coffees in the room with a kettle of course
- tropical fishes in the water area near the entrance and under the opaque flooring near the lifts

Would I stay at this hotel again?...Hells yeah!

Muchas Gracias Hesperia Tower :)",5,2013,06,08
30,Close to Airport,Good Hotel only 20 Euros in a Taxi from the airport. Great views from the higher rooms good place to spend a night but nothing to do near by. The down stairs bar was very good but the one on the roof was closed when we visited.,4,2013,06,07
30,Take advantage of the recession to stay somewhere nice,"On very short notice I booked the first nice hotel I came across on Trip Advisor that was near the airport. This was the Hesperia Towers, a 5-star hotel for a 3-star price.  When I told my Spanish colleague where I was staying he said ‚ÄúWow‚Äù as it has a very good reputation.

Check in was very smooth with four desks open and only a few guests in the queue.  English was not a problem. My super cheap deal included breakfast, which unfortunately I could not take advantage of as I had very early morning starts. However I had to extend my stay by an extra day and did finally get to have the breakfast which was excellent.  A really good range of hot and cold food, fresh orange juice and coffee brought to your table and fresh fruit.
The lifts are ordered by touch panel, which tells you which of the four glass sided lifts to take.  

The hall ways are rich materials and beautiful mahogany wood, though I did notice a number of dings and dents, one of the downsides of having guests with luggage trundling past such expensive materials. The room itself was in two parts, an entry foyer with the closet and bathroom plus shower of it, with floor to ceiling mirrors and hidden storage cupboards.  All black marble, sumptuous wood and mirrors.  It felt expensive and was designed to impress.

The bedroom is large with plenty of desk space, a mini-bar and a display cabinet with nice touches like a cork screw, fine wine glasses and a bottle opener.  The TV had lots of channels including a number in English like the BBC, CNN, Bloomberg etc.  Wifi Internet was free, but dreadfully slow, even when showing 5 bars.  I at best managed about 15 kb/s and it reminded me of dial up modem days.

I ate at the internal restaurant ‚ÄúBouquet‚Äù and my meal of local squid for starter and a thick steak were both perfect. With two glassed of house red and a coffee in addition to the two courses this came to 56 ‚Ç¨.  The maitre de and the wine waiter were both very helpful, in fact all of the service was very good indeed.

So I would stay here again, as long as the price remains reasonable.  It appears that the recession is hurting them hard, my room cost me as little at ¬£78 a night and can be seen on Hotels.com and similar sites for heavily discounted rates.",4,2013,06,06
30,Great place to stay,"We have stayed there with my boyfriend and it was a lovely place to live. Big hotel, but never too crowded. Biggest breakfasts I have seen, everything super clean and the rooms are just magnificent, simple, modern, well equipped. Restaurant on the top floor has great views and delicious food. Close to metro station and with extremely helpful staff.",5,2013,06,05
30,Better suited for Business.,"We got a good deal on this hotel ,and as others have commented it is on the edge of the town and a 30 minute metro journey in. However the metro is a few minutes walk and its direct into the heart of the city. Should you stay out all night and miss the metro back a taxi was 13 euros, and took ten minutes.
The plus side is that this is a nice hotel, clean comfortable rooms, with great views, and a stones throw to the airport. They had rooms available for us at 10.00 am , and a free shuttle is available at certain times both to and from the airport.
We did not take up the hotels offer of breakfast, and instead walked into the nearby housing estate, where we got good food and coffee. There are local restaurants within the vicinity and the one we ate at was good.",4,2013,06,05
30,"Nice Hotel, not in the center but very compfortable","Nice Hotel with luxurious rooms and suites, pity the top restaurant is no longer available. The hotel is half way from airport to city, give a good compromise between the relaxing staying and affordable prices compared to the prices in the center much higher for rooms far away from Hesperia.
With a taxi,  in from of the Hotel always 374 cabs ready , you can be in Barcelona center in 10 minutes and enjoy the city as much as you like.
Great breakfast and really clear hotel, reception good. 
Worth it !",4,2013,06,04
30,OK stay - but would not stay again,"Bed was comfortable and appeared clean but carpet was filthy and very stained.  And there was a 14 Euro charge to use the pool and spa,.  Location is about a 30 minute easy metro ride from the center of action in Barcelona.  We only stayed for 1 night to be have access to the hotel airport shuttle for a morning flight.  If getting to the airport for an early morning flight is a concern, this might be a good option - other than that, look elsewhere.",3,2013,06,04
30,Barcelona City Break,"Got a lastmute city break to Barcelona and stayed 2 nights in this hotel.  A tall modern architectual hotel which is on the end of the Red metro line (a little too far in my opinion from the centre) but acceptable, good rate not the cheapest by a long way but very good standard. Polite and helpful staff, breakfast was a buffet which was fantastic (again check your hotel booking as paying on the day proved expensive),  Free shuttle to airport . The tower was closed as a restaurant and now is used as meeting rooms we never got to go to the top which was dissapointing.  Beautiful city/sea/airport view.  Enjoyed very much",5,2013,06,03
30,"Excellent, Stylish Hotel in the Barcelona Suburbs","I have been staying in the Hesperia Tower Hotel for a 3-day-trip to Barcelona.

Almost everything was perfect. The hotel and especially the rooms are very nice and stylish, service was extremely friendly and the breakfast buffet was excellent.

The only minor disadvantages: The hotel is situated a bit far outside the city center (about a 35 minute subway ride). But there is a hotel shuttle bus going to the city center and back in the evening. For our purposes (we watched a Champions League match at Camp Nou) the hotel location was perfect since it is very close to the stadium and also to the airport.

For a 5-star hotel the beds could be more comfortable. I have stayed in 4-star hotels that had more comfortable beds.

All in all the hotel was great. I will definitely come back for my next visit to beautiful Barcelona.",5,2013,06,03
30,great hotel,we couldnt locate free shuttle from airport so opted for taxi and felt ripped off as on the meter it said 13.85 euros but then he added an extra 20 euros just because we came from airport so just be aware of that.this is a very good hotel we were on 15th floor i wouldnt say great view as the hotel is located by business park  not far from airport but this isnt a negative as the hotel is good a tip you may be interested in opposite the front of the hotel across the roundabout in the car park is a metro station it isnt immediately apparent but it is there and we didnt find this out until last day so if you miss the free shuttle bus into town it will save you an hour walk. the spa facilities are connected to the hotel but run separately.  we had breakfast in restaurant azimut located on 4th floor every morning and found it to be a very well run outfit great selection of food well presented and taste good. we also had an evening meal on one of the nights in bouquet restaurant again very well run however two things my starter of seasonal veg with garlic which was great was also the same selection minus the garlic on my main course of fish it wasgreat food however i just found it a bit unimaginative for such a high class restaurant also after our starter we were offered dessert menu which thought was odd so my husband dessert came before our main obviously a big mistake which we pointed out and staff very apologetic and we were given free glass of dessert wine each it was very funny and the staff were great it was a bit over priced but it was really good food. all in all a very good clean hotel great rooms but i probably wouldnt stay again as i would prefer to be located more central to the town and its amenities (my husband booked the hotel!). also bar prices very expensive a mojito in town cost 3.50 - 4.50euros in the hotel bar 12euros so your choice.,4,2013,06,02
30,Excellent Stay for a Reasonable Price,"I had a really good first impression upon arriving at the hotel. My mom and I were on vacation and stayed there for 4 days/3 nights.  The shuttle situation to the hotel was confusing, though.  I had called the hotel asking where the pick up location was and I was only told to be at Terminal 1 at a certain time. We waited for a long time and saw no Hotel Hesperia shuttle-- if I missed it somehow, then the sign needs to be bigger and clearer.  We ended up taking a taxi. Check-in was supposed to be at 3pm but we had an early flight; luckily our room was ready and the front desk allowed us to get into our room around 1pm.

We stayed in a standard room and was impressed with the cleanliness and decoration of the space.  The bathroom was really nice with a double vanity, jet showers, separate room for the toilet, and a lot of closet space.  The bed was comfortable and the couch was great to sit on and look at the view from the floor-to-ceiling window.  We were on the 13th floor, so it was nice to leave the curtains open a little at night and have the view of the city lights. The hotel in general is very quiet, so there were no problems with noise.

I only had the time to go to the breakfast buffet for only one morning during my stay, but if I had had the time I definitely would have gone every morning! You must make a reservation with the front desk the night prior.  There's a good selection of items in addition to the traditional breakfast fare. The food was delicious and the service was friendly.

The hotel's free shuttle also conveniently takes you to Placa de Catalunya in the morning and picks you up in the evening.  My mom and I  were able to take the whole day to walk around and see the sights. A taxi to the area will run you about 10 to 15 euros.

I also ordered room service for dinner during my last night.  I had the advertised room service special, which was a burger, fries, and drink for 15 euros and my mom ordered a pig suckling dish.  The burger was delicious!  When I called to have room service pick up the cart, I was asked if I wanted coffee and dessert. He mentioned the chef's special which was chocolate creme brulee and I placed the order immediately. It was also really good!

The rate is extremely reasonable for the amenities you get and the services they provide.  Personally, I think it's cheaper than what a typical hotel like this should command.  My mom and I enjoyed our stay and experienced no problems, other than the minor inconvenience of the shuttle from the airport to the hotel. I would definitely stay there again if I ever return to Barcelona.",5,2013,05,30
30,"The good, the bad and the ugly","First the good...the rooms are all pretty nice, especially the suites on the upper floors. They provide an incredible view. If you don't want to shell out the extra dollars no need to as the view from the standard room is nice and the room itself is very comfortable.

The bad... there is only 1 restaurant in the hotel and it is quite expensive. You would book this hotel strictly for its proximity to the airport. It is otherwise close to nothing and is an expensive cab ride downtown.

The ugly....they advertise shuttle service to and from the hotel. After arriving in Barcelona and waiting over an hour for the shuttle we called the hotel only to find out that the next shuttle was 2 hours later.
Upon leaving the hotel we had to stand outside in cold weather well in advance of the shuttle's departure to the airport in order to ensure one of the 12 spots available in the shuttle.",3,2013,05,29
30,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed here the night before a long flight home after a cruise. I was not expecting a lot because of the low rate. I was thrilled to find out that this is a very modern and very comfortable place to stay. The lobby of the hotel is massive and very nice. The room is large and modern as well, divided into two separate areas. One sleeping area and a bathroom area that is huge. There is not a lot of restaurants or shops in the area, but we had done that for 10 days already. Therefore, we just had dinner in one of the restaurants in the hotel. It was a little pricey but, the food, atmosphere, & service were very good. Then in the morning we took the free shuttle to the airport, which took only around 10 minutes. We will surely stay here again if/when in Barcelona.",5,2013,05,29
30,Great Hotel - Not so great Location,"Stayed here for one during during a ""3 nights - 3 different hotels"" city break in Barcelona. We stayed here on our first night which was great as it is so close to the airport. There is also free shuttle bus from airport to hotel. Rooms were gorgeous and clean - the huge shower with the jets was definitely my favourite! Had pizza and beer room service, good value. Unfortunately me and my boyfriend fell asleep when we got in from a day in the city at about 7pm and when we woke up at 10pm it was too late to get food from anywhere close by or the hotel restaurants so be aware! Staff were very friendly and helpful. Also free wi-fi. Metro station right opposite the hotel. Got this hotel on Last minute secret hotels.",4,2013,05,28
30,Perfetto Journey,"We've bene in Hesperia Tower tris month and it was very Beautiful.  The hotel is superb,  receptionists are always there  for your needs and the room was very very beautiful with all the comfort you can imagine,  even dolby surround in the bath and dock station for iphone and ipod.  Also you can eat in the restaurant with a special men√π,  without spend too much,  a full meal for 30‚Ç¨. ",5,2013,05,27
30,Hesperia Tower experience,"I have just returned home today after 9 days at the Hesperia Tower.  I stayed on the 24th floor in a junior suite which was superb with all the facilities offered in the room, not least, a really comfortable bed where I slept 9 hours a night!  The views from the room were great including the Olympic Hill in the distance.  I had access to the Tower Club which was superb in all ways, I ate continental breakfast, any amount, every day and enjoyed unlimited drinks and nibbles up to 10.30pm each evening, though I did not overdo that, but the wines and cava were great!  It was always very quiet, but real quality with B&O TV and CD and totally unobtrusive.  The restaurant, Evo, on the top level is not closed but usually reserved  for conference banquets.  Top line....It is an expensive hotel, but if you are careful, it can be a great place to stay.",5,2013,05,24
30,Could do better,"Booked this as part of a social living deal so was excellent value, I knew about the hotel being out of the way and the reality is that the Metro is very close and 23mins into the centre of Barcelona Placa Catalunyia, we bought 3 day metro pass which was about ¬£16 pp and turned out to be very good value as one evening having had a lovely meal by the beach and lots of Cava we decided to taxi back which was 20 euro's! The rooms are lovely, bathrooms are lush and the views are amazing, breakfast was exceptional, one of the best buffets I have had in a long time and staff were very helpful.  What was disappointing was Evo restaurant was closed and only the lobby bar was open and I felt it was a massive waste for there not to be a sky bar or something at the top of the Tower to maximise on the views, I would definiately have had a night cap there every night if it had. Room service was a rip off, particularly the 5 euro room charge, one night all we wanted was ice and got charged 5 euro for them to bring it !!! However, it was my birthday while I was there and we returned on the evening of my birthday to find a birthday cake, which was a nice touch, as my partner nor I had told them. It was good but they could do alot better in my opinion. Had a nice break but still think I will chise a more central location next time.",4,2013,05,23
30,Not as good as it sounds,"I booked this expecting a higher standard of hotel and got second rate.

Arrived at the airport after calling in advance to ask about shuttle bus. It took two hours to arrive and I was told it was a fuel issue. By the time it arrived their was more people than it could carry and it refused to return.
Its location is not central and they expect people to use the tube. The tube is great though and prompt. its is limitied if you have a late night and a taxi will be required.

The room I had was lovely. Clean and the facilites where as described and better.

The staff are nice although they cannot react to anything out of the norm. Any special request was difficult and hard work. Breakfast I was told prior was to be included but this was a mistake and I was then directed to mt booking company even though I had the paperwork.

Whilst I never spent much time in the hotel during the day I asked about the shuttle bus for my return to the airport. I was advised the time and told you cannot book. I turned up at the allotted time to be told that the bus was full and I would have to make my own way to the airport. This is not what you expect from a hotel offering an apparent 5 star service.

There are plenty of other superior options in the city and I would suggest you try them rather than accept this poor hotel. So in summary, Bedrooms nice, clean and well maintained. Staff good but could try arder. Shuttle bus service is terrrible. Tube is clean and efficient.",2,2013,05,21
30,Excellent hotel,Very clean stylish hotel were blown away by the impressive views from the 14th floor.the staff were lovely and friendly and approachable nothing too much trouble. The tube was very close by excellent prices cheap travel will defo be going back next year,5,2013,05,21
30,What a great find!,"We booked this hotel as a last minute booking after a mix up at another hotel and have to say that we loved the whole experience. The staff were very friendly, taking lots of time to explain the different rooms available.

Wer booked a tower suite, which included access to the Tower Club, where you can sit in the afternoon and have a glass of wine or a beer and relax. The view is amazing and the club was really quiet. (You can have breakfast there as well rather than going downstairs and it's included in the price of your room)
I read a few people didn't like where the hotel was situated but it is a five minute walk to the underground, which is great. We went into Barcelona most nights for dinner and got the metro home again and felt really safe.
The rooms are large and comfortable and I didn't have any reason to complain about anything - it was perfect.
It is a bit out of the city but it's worth staying here if only because the staff are just so good.",5,2013,05,15
30,Fantastic Design !!!,"Wow - what a fantastic Design at this Hotel. We get Bookingfrom our Company there and stay for 2 Nights in late February. When we enterd the Lobby, itwasvery impressive and fantastic. Aslo Service was high Class Level and welike this two Nights there. It is a little bit faraway from the Barcelona Center. To Barcelona airport, itwas just 15 Minutes by Car. Selection at Breakfast was amazing too!",5,2013,05,13
30,Very stylish - yet remote,"The stylish tower is located in Bellvitge, a suburb of Barcelona. Although it is quite some distance to the center it is easy to get there with the underground only some hundred meters away. And the service on the underground is the best I have experienced throughout Europe: You pay less than 10 Euros for a carnet of 10 tickets and we never waited more than 3 minutes for the next train to come. Modern and clean  waggons, no comparison to London or Paris. 
We booked a special offer by Hesperia so there is no use debating whether the hotel really deserves all 5 stars. The architecture is very stylish, rooms are sufficiently large and clean and the prebooked breakfast for 15 EUR (otherwise 24 EUR) is okay (or you go to one of the cafes nearby). Parking in the garage is 18 EUR per day.
If you are fine with the remote location the Hesperia can clearly be recommended.",5,2013,05,12
30,our favorite hotel in barcelona,"it was already our fifth stay there and we truly can recommend it to most of everyone (business and tourists). although we have to say, that it is a little bit outside located - half way between city and airport, it is anyway recommendable. the design, the good breakfast andthe friendly staff was always great. great is also the spectacular view from the higher etages to barclona and its outskirts - super!",5,2013,05,10
30,"Great hotel, 5 star staff, SPA/gym not free, far from city center","We traveled as a couple and stayed there for one night in the first week of May.
100 euro for one night before tax, without breakfast.

Pros:
Great 5 star hotel. Nice, clean, and new facility and room. Good beds. Great views to the city with a big window.
The staff was all extremely nice and professional and deserved to be in a 5 star hotel.
Free WiFi in a 5 star hotel.

Cons:
The SPA and gym costs 14 Euros to use.
WiFi was unbelievably slow in the room, but OK in the lobby.
The location is very far from the city center. It is in the end of metro L1 line. It takes 5 minutes to walk to the metro. It takes 20 euros to the airport by taxi in the early morning.

The sound insulation could have been better. A room of kids were partying with very loud music and the noise went through the front doors.",5,2013,05,09
30,Excellent City Break,"Enjoyed a lovely city break, staying for 4 nights at the Hesperia Tower Barcelona in early May. 

Impressed immediately upon arrival by the easily accessible complementary airport shuttle that took us from Terminal 1 to the hotel.  This was topped on our last day by the fact that the friendly and enthusiastic lady driver even dropped us off directly Terminal 2 (saving us from having to catch the inter terminal airport shuttle). There is usually a queue for the shuttle and limited seats (13) but so long as you are sensible and arrive early to wait outside, you should have no problems finding a seat. The same applies to the shuttle into the centre of town.

Enjoyed a very good rate on a 'Tower Club' room which not only offered amazing views of the city, but also entitled us to access to the 'Tower Club Lounge' which offered complementary drinks (alcoholic and non) and snacks throughout the day. This also meant that we benefited from a well stocked continental breakfast in the morning that proved ideal for setting us up for a full day's worth of sightseeing excursions. 

We ate in the 'Bouquet' restaurant for one night and found the food to be delicious (and not overly priced for such a high standard of hotel). Particularly pleased by the fact that the waiter very kindly fitted us in (without a reservation) at very short notice. We were told that a table would be ready for us in 10 minutes which proved accurate and a perfect opportunity to indulge in a pre meal drink and starter selections (canapes and gazpacho) in the Tower Club Lounge! 

The room itself was to a very high standard, and was cleaned well each day. Our room did not have a bath but the walk-in shower was very relaxing with the message jets feature. 

Some travellers may be put off at first by the location of the hotel and the proxity to Las Ramblas and the centre but I would encourage them not to be as the complementary shuttle and the nearby metro station means that this is not a real issue. The hotel is the last stop on a direct line (L1) to the centre and like a fellow traveller below, we too bought T10 tickets for just under 10 euro which meant we could go to all the major sights at a fraction of the cost of say a tourist 'city hop on' bus. Furthermore, the fact that the hotel was out of the centre actually worked in our favour, as when returning from watching a Barca FC game late in the evening, we were able to avoid the majority of the crowds on the metro headed for the centre.

Finally, a special mention should be made to the staff of the hotel who were all very friendly, cheerful and helpful. 

Would definitely consider a return visit to Hesperia Tower and have no reservations in recommending it to friends and family.",5,2013,05,07
30,Unknown treasure,"Just returned from Barcelona, Stayed here at the Hesperia Suites which is part of the Towers. Excellent. Super clean. Wonderful staff. Close to the Metro so you can get around Barcelona easily. The Fira suites are great io you have a family or you are there on business. They have full kitchens with frigs and stoves.",5,2013,05,07
30,receptionists were so bad,"as this hotel is near the airport, I decided to stay the last day. But it was a great mistake. The worst of it is that receptionists looked down guests. If only they had at least an ounce of good faith in them. It is absolutely certain that they are racialist. I really got depressed their attitude. They must learn hotel guests are not only whites.",1,2013,05,06
30,Highly recommended Hesperia Tower,"We have just returned from this hotel which was absolutely fantastic. We booked a suite which had an enormous bathroom with a jacuzzi and a shower which you could spend all day in. 
The reception desk were really helpful in letting us check in early and were really good at explaining everything we wanted to know. The suite was spot on. The hotel provided a really nice cake on our arrival too because it was my husband's birthday the day we arrived and I must say that was delicious too. 
We had access to the tower club and continental  breakfast was provided at the Tower Club which we found very basic which I would say was the only Critism I had to raise. Having booked a suite it would have been nice to have a hot buffet breakfast included at the Tower Club. 
The hotel is at the last stop ""hospital de bellvitge"" and less than three minute walk and easily noticeable as soon as you get off the metro station. 
We were not bothered about staying close to the la Ramblas because it was so easy to get on the metro for that.
Tip is to buy a T10 ticket which you can use all day. My husband and I just purchased that one ticket and we got 10 rides for less than 10 euros much cheaper than taxi fares.
Back to this fantastic hotel I would definitely stop here on my next visit and would highly recommend it to all my friends and families.
All the staff were very friendly and helpful. 5 star service.",5,2013,05,06
30,Excellent hotel and very fairly priced!,"We booked this hotel knowing fine well it was quite far out the city center but i would say to everyone don't let that put you off at all!
The metro station less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel and with trains very 4-6 minutes through the day there was little waiting around and as it is the last stop in the red line, you were guaranteed a seat on the train. It took around about 25 minutes to get right into the heart of the city but as it is such a huge city, no matter where you stayed you would still have to use some sort of public transport to get around!
The room was amazing! We were on the 12th floor and the room had a great view right across the city. The bed was extremely comfortable and although you are very close to a main road, there was nothing but peace and quiet within the room and the hotel itself was very quiet indeed and we were never disturbed by people in the hallway or using the lifts. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone that isn't phased by the thought of having to use public transport and who loves a bit of luxury!",5,2013,05,06
30,"Bad Hotel, please don't come and left it for me","For all those complaining about this hotel because they either don't plan their visit well or have not stay in enough hotels in Spain's big cities.
Barcelona's hotel are very expensive in high season, a hotel charged $75EU with full breakfast will become $250 with no breakfast in their same lousy room and lousy bed and furniture at high season.
Fortunately I was visiting at Barcelona at high season in beginning of May. I booked this hotel knowingly
it was very far from Rambla and located in middle of no convenient for tourist.
The room is great a 5 stars standard in Spain. NH hotel group are high end hotel in EU. and for less than $100EU per night I am living like a king with very shallow pocket.
Metro station is 3 minutes walk from the hotel (the shortest I experienced in any hotel I had stay in)
Buy a 10 trips metro pass which can be use for muti-passagers, Line #1 will take you directly into
the center of Rambla plus directly to many attractions.
The only sacrifice is the 20 minutes ride back and forth around trip which we only did once or twice daily. There are no shop around the area but there is a gas station right next to the hotel
which you can buy pops and chip.   
At low season I might consider stay at more convenience situated hotel but I will definitely miss
Hesperia's huge comfy bed and 5 stars setting.",5,2013,05,05
30,Amazing!,"What a fabulous hotel!!!! It definitely deserves its 5 star rating. We stayed in a suite on the 24th floor with views towards the city and enjoyed every minute of it. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable, the huge jacuzzi bath and large walk-in shower were luxurious as were the Bvlgari toiletries. Having two separate toilets was a luxury. There was absolutely no corridor noise as the size and layout of the suite meant that there was a room between the bedroom and the corridor. The curtains were push button and the lifts were a dream. Because we were in a suite, we had complimentary access to the tower floor which gives you access to meeting rooms, continental breakfast, tea, coffee, snacks, wine, spirits and beer until 10.30pm each day.  There was also free wifi which was a little weak - maybe because we were on a high floor. Yes it is on the outskirts of the city and you have to travel further to the centre but you would have to pay twice the price to get the same luxury down town for the sake of travelling 20 minutes on the metro. I would definitely return.",5,2013,05,02
30,"Awesome hotel, wish it was closer to the city","My wife and I stayed in the Hesperia Tower for three nights. Room was spacious and tidy, bathrooms large and spotless. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I have asked for a few things on 2-3 separate occasions from reception (once after mind night) and my requests were attended to almost immediately. Staff were also helpful when i asked about tourist attractions and the best way to get to them. Air conditioning/heating worked just fine.

I read some reviews about squeaky pipes and noisy rooms but we had nothing of the sort. 

The breakfast buffet was excellent and reasonably priced (‚Ç¨15 pp if you book it a night in advance as posed to ‚Ç¨24 for buying it on the same day). We had free wifi in the rooms which was a big plus (I had to pay for it per night in other hotels in Europe!)

I could not fault the hotel for anything except it being a little bit far from the heart of the city. The metro station was a minute away from the hotel and it to us at least 20-25 minutes on the same line to get to Pla√ßa Catalunya and La Ramblas. As we came back once in each of our 3 days, we wished it was a bit closer but I would still highly recommend it as the stay was very pleasant.",5,2013,05,01
30,Anniversary break,"Travelled here with my husband in Sep 2012 on a 4 night anniversary break. This hotel is clean, tidy, rooms were great, didn't eat here so can't comment but for us it was just too far out of the city. It took us over an hour and 2 tubes to get into the main areas which took up a lot of our4 days as we would travel there and back twice a day. Definitely more of a business hotel rather than for tourists.",4,2013,05,01
30,Really personal and friendly service,"Lovely clean hotel with fab buffet breakfast (fresh fruit etc).  Rooms large, big beds, bit noisy rooms (creaky pipes) but ok.

The staff were so helpful providing ice for swollen ankles, couldnt do more to help.  Really friendly and personable.",4,2013,04,28
30,"Great hotel, nice rooms","We stayed in this hotel for three nights. The location is not near the center, but the metro station is nearby and it is directly to the city center. The room was nice and confortable, but there was no option to open the window (there was no window) and the air conditioner was not working so good. The bed was confortable. We slept very well.  We had only one issue during our stay with the room service. We ordered the dinner, soup, some salad and srimps. the food had no taste and in the shrimps were with the send!!!!!!! we call to reception and they fixed our complain fast!!! They give us money back and appologize to us. At all the hotel was nice and we will recommend it to our friends.",4,2013,04,22
30,"Great hotel, fantastic room, views, shower amazing, friendly staff","We chose this hotel via trip advisor reviews and it delivered. Recommend this hotel for short stays in Barcelona close to airport, short trip via metero to city centre. A refreshing shower with huge shower head and massaging jets revitalise the body ready for the evening.
Special mention to Roberto the concieirge who could not do enough for us from taking us to our room showing us the ins and outs etc. Peter K and wife Robin T Australia",5,2013,04,20
30,Outstanding Service,"Although the Hesperia Tower Hotel is located outside the downtown core of Barcelona excellent service is provided through a hotel shuttle service and a five minute walk to the Metro that takes you wherever you like to go.

Staff at the hotel are professional and courteous. Food services meets the needs of any traveller. 
A Five Star Hotel with reasonable rates and clean rooms.",5,2013,04,17
30,"Excellent Hotel, bad location.","I stayed in this hotel for three nights in September 2012 and it is certainly a high quality hotel.  The rooms are excellent, really good facilities and comfortable.  Everything is very clean and the reception staff are very helpful.  It's quite quiet as it's much more a business hotel than one for tourists.

The location isn't perfect; it's a 30+ minute metro ride into the city centre, but the station is only across the road and the Barcelona metro really is an excellent system.  Journeys are cheap and painless.

The other issue is that there is nowhere around the hotel to buy any kind of food or drink unless you want to pay the hotel's very expensive prices.  It is a very isolated location.

The views from the hotel are very polarising.  If you're lucky enough to get a room on the side which faces towards the city you'll have a lovely view, but if you're on the other side you'll look out over motorways and industrial wasteland.  Considering one of its selling points is the view; those 50/50 odds aren't great!

All in all we found it worth the money due to the quality of the rooms and the nice atmosphere.  If you're only spending a couple of nights in Barcelona, this could be the hotel for you.",4,2013,04,14
30,Stunning hotel in the middle of nowhere,"Admittedly, I didn't really choose Hesperia Tower.  It just happened to be the mystery hotel on a lastminute.com offer, however I would choose it again given the chance.

First impressions of the hotel were not especially good.  The hotel, from the outside, looks a bit odd, with a rather strange UFO-like glass dome on the roof.  Although the closer you get the better it looks.  The main lobby is very stylish with masses of seating and plenty of neon lights.  

We were staying on the 12th floor, which is about half way up the hotel, but still taller than all the surrounding apartments (FYI the surrounding area is not touristy).  The room really was excellent.  We had the standard double, but it was really very plush.  The room had air conditioning and superb bathroom facilities.  I especially enjoyed the button that opened the curtains - totally pointless - but still good fun.

The staff were always friendly and were happy to give us information on the city, including recommendations of locations to eat and drink.  There is also a large touchscreen tablet in the lobby where additional city info can be sought.

The hotels main floor is the location.  It is in very close proximity to the hospital tube station, but that is the end of the line.  So it was about a 20-25min train ride each way to the centre of Barcelona. Fortunately, the Barcelona underground system is excellent, yet a bit of a drain on time.  The local area around the hotel is not very appealing, although there is a nice little park near the main road.

On the whole a brilliant hotel in a terrible location.  More appealing for those on business, than those on a romantic city break.

30,Unbelievable Hotel for a Terrific Price,"I booked this hotel for the last night of a long European/Mediterranean vacation in January 2013.  I was looking for an affordable hotel, close to the airport so I could catch an early morning flight back to the USA.  What I received, however, was a luxury hotel that I didn't want to leave.  Had I known what a great hotel this was I would have spent several nights here.  

There are many positives.  The design and amenities of this hotel are far above its price range.  The bath/shower/dressing areas (you can't really refer to it as a ""bathroom"") are stunning.  My family took pictures of all the details so we could show our friends back in the States.  I've stayed in hotels in 44 countries and I can't think of any hotel that tries any harder to be fit the definition of ""luxury hotel.""

There are only two small drawbacks  First, the location is difficult to get to by car.  We could see the tower (it is the highest building in the area) but we couldn't figure out how to get to there.  The road system is frustrating and without a GPS we spent about an hour trying to find the road that would take us to the hotel.  Second, the hotel is located fairly close to the airport but far from downtown.  If you are a tourist who wants easy access to the Gothic quarter you'll need to consider your transportation each day.  

Earlier in the trip my family had spent several nights in a small, budget hotel close to Las Ramblas where we spent MORE money for a room half the size, with almost no amenities.  Next time I'm in Barcelona I'll remember Hesperia Towers and I'll spend no less than 3 nights there -- despite the commute to downtown.",5,2013,04,12
30,If luxury is what you seek‚Ä¶,"We stayed in Hesperia Tower at the end of an amazing week and a half of traveling through the north of Spain. We started our adventure in Oviedo and drove all the way to Barcelona, stooping in many cities along the way.  As you can image, by the end we were pretty beaten, it was incredibly hot and we were much in need of rest and relaxation. We had already been to Barcelona so it wasn‚Äôt very important to stay right in the middle of the busy city with easy access to all the important sights as we just wanted to have a couple of quiet days wandering the city calmly and without agenda. We indulged ourselves and chose to stay in this amazing 5 stars hotel. 
The lobby is amazing, very modern and chic, with an inviting lounge area. All the staff we encountered was very nice and welcoming and made a real effort to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The room was a dream. You enter into a hall where you can find the closet and separate doors that lead to the shower and the toilet. There were his and hers sinks and the entire room had black tiles from top to bottom. Entering the actual room, that‚Äôs when you get stunned. The entire back wall is a giant window overlooking the modern part of the city, at night it can take your breath away if you fancy this kind of view. The bed was gigantic with a lot of pillows and unbelievable comfortable. In front of the window we had a nice sofa to sit a while enjoying the view and having a drink. This room was designed having comfort in mind. The blinds and the curtains were electric, so you can open/close them while lying on the bed. There was a nice minibar as well as a desk. The room was impeccably decorated in a modern stylish way. 
The hotel sits very close to the Bellvitge Station on the Metro‚Äôs Red Line. It takes about 40 minutes to get to the Catalunya Station in the city center, this was the only inconvenient of Hesperia Tower. However, being almost at the end of the red line, it was easy to get a seat in the Metro coming or going to the city. If you prefer, the hotel has a free shuttle to take you to the Plaza de la Catalunya and back, you need to find out the schedule and line up a good 20 minutes before or you won‚Äôt have a place.
We would most definitely stay in Hesperia Tower Again, hopefully sooner than later!",5,2013,04,08
30,Great Property,Hesperia Tower is a superb hotel offering great facilities a little out of the main centre of Barcelona.  The views from the upper level rooms are fantastic.  Rooms are extremely comfortable and spacious and offer everything you need (I stayed in a small suite but did see other rooms which were also of a high quality).  The use of the club lounge was an asset and meant that a quick breakfast could be enjoyed away from a potentially busy restaurant and it also provided a great base for end of day catch up meetings with a civilised aperitif (or two!).  A very comfortable and pleasant stay and a hotel I would recommend.,5,2013,04,08
30,Beautiful & Convenient,"This was a great hotel. Me & my friend traveled to Barcelona April 2013 for a one day stay in this hotel after a 9 night cruise. When taking a cab to this hotel, you realize it is far from the Metro Center, but do not panick. This hotel makes it convenient & free!!!
1. Has a shuttle to the Main Center, where you can purchase a Hop on/Hop Off Bus Ride Tour. Cheaper if purchased at hotel. 
2. Has a free shuttle to airport, super convenient.
3. Near metro station, that's a 15min ride to the Metro Center
4. The view of Barcelona from the top floor (which we upgraded to) was beautiful.
5. Clean Hotel & very High Tech (took a minute just to figure out how to use the elevator). Which by the way, the elevator has a beautiful view of the city, too.
6. Staff were friendly & very helpful.
7. Oh, & FREE WI-FI! Ipod Dock.

Highly recommend this Hotel. Didn't get a chance to eat in restaurant, to busy exploring Barcelona!!",5,2013,04,07
30,Perfect break,"This is a super hotel with fabulous facilities. Only 15 mins on the metro to barcelona main center.
We up graded to a suite on the 24th floor  which was beautiful.
Only down side was the restaurant on the roof was closed, I must say the other restaurants within the hotel were very good though.
Will definitely return.",5,2013,04,01
30,superb hotel,"a 5 star break in a 5 star hotel

our only criticism is that in a 5 star hotel i expect health club facilities to be inclusive, and was mildly annoyed to have to pay extra

breakfast is first class

highly recommend upgrading to a suite on the top floor, an experience to savour! we will be back!",5,2013,03,31
30,Nice Hotel for Spring Break Stop,"The hotel itself was fantastic; the rooms were top notch and appeared very clean. The breakfast was very good, although not worth ‚Ç¨24. We encountered trouble with the airport shuttle; we could not locate the schedule that was sent to us and when we called the front desk. We were told the incorrect time (they had trouble understanding English) which left us standing outside the airport for an hour and a half and resulted in a ‚Ç¨25 taxi ride. The manager rectified the situation reasonably, however. To get to the city centre, you must take the metro (about 5 minute walk away) and it takes about 20 minutes.",4,2013,03,30
30,Very nice stay,"I stayed here on a recent trip to Barcelona for a weekend break. The hotel is located close to the airport and has a free shuttle bus that we made use of. There is a metro stop on the opposite side of the road which takes you straight into the city center in about 25 minutes. On arrival the hotel staff were very friendly and courteous. The hotel was very clean and modern with large open areas. The room itself was very nice with a large bathroom. The room was spotless and housekeeping had done a very good job. This is one of the tallest buildings in Barcelona and the views from the upper floors are fantastic, especially if your facing towards the city. I would have no problem returning to this hotel next time I visit Barcelona.",4,2013,03,26
30,Ghost Hotel,"My girlfriend and I wanted to stay close to the airport on our last night in Barca. We chose the Hesperia because it was close, looked nice and was fairly priced. 
This place is so dead that it literally seems like you are the only guests in the hotel. I understand that it is a business hotel and I am sure it gets much more crowded for conferences and things like that. 
They really screw you on the food here which isn't that good. Room service is actually cheaper than the restaurant which is what we decided to do because there are no other options close by. 
Caesar salad, burger, pizza and 2 cokes -$100
They also ran my girlfriends card 11 times for some odd reason which caused the bank to freeze her account. Thank God our trip was over. My first and last stay at Hesperia wasn't as good as expected.",3,2013,03,19
30,The best.......we love it!!,"Great, great view, excelent service simply the best!! easy access to everything, very close to the airport and quiet!! can anybody ask for more? The breakfast buffet was great, well cooked and good quality products. About the room... the bed.... so good and the windows really add to a great accommodation experience. You can push the button and the curtains open and close automatically to a spectacular view of the city. We stay at the 18th floor and what a view!!!! it was a nice shopping center a few minutes away.
The only complaint is that.................we couldn't stay longer!!!!!",5,2013,03,15
30,Very good and comfortable conference hotel,"We had a two-day conference at this hotel. Very close to the airport, but also easy access to the city. Rooms were very comfortable and well-equipped. Very nice breakfast buffet. Access to internet was slightly difficult; it was necessary to type in the access code every time again. One really wonders why they make this so difficult. But for the rest a great hotel.",4,2013,03,15
30,Anniversary Weekend!,"Weekend in barcelona. Hotel just between barcelona centre and airport, easy access to tube, very quiet if you dont like the hustle and bustle. 
Beautiful rooms, pristine bathrooms. Very modern (push button automatic curtains!) very nice view, ask for room on higher floor! Big bed, very comfortable. Great room service and posh restaurants with tasty menu - although not the cheapest, but value for money.

Maybe outside catalunya but was cheaper to get taxi from airport (shuttle bus is also available from hotel) and pay for transport on tube, than a taxi into catalunya - one couple we talked to paid 40 euro for taxi into catalunya, nevermind the expensive rates for hotels in the centre.",5,2013,03,15
30,Convenient for an overnight stay in Barcelona,"This was my first time visit to this hotel. Although I was familiar with the building with its quirky 'flying saucer' roof top restaurant as part of the Barcelona skyline.  I had an overnight business stay in Barcelona and due to a Champions League football game on most central hotels were booked out.  The Hesperia was available and reasonably priced for what was on offer.

I liked the idea that they had a shuttle bus from/to the airport,however there are fixed times scheduled and these are the only times the shuttle will operate.  A taxi ride is only around 11 euro's but the cabs will ALWAYS charge a minimum of Euro 20 as the hotel being 5 minutes away from the airport is still considered within the airport locale and surcharges apply.  This is not the fault of the hotel, but a 15 euro taxi trip will take you to the centre of town so the taxi charging logic just fails me.

Anyhoo, the hotel reception is an open plan cavern and checking in was simple and quick.  The elevator system is one of the best I've seen. Click on a terminal and it displays which elevator is available.   On entering the room I was pleasantly surprised that the hall and the bathroom are one.  The bathroom hall is a combination of chrome and mirrored smoke glass..all very arty, but frankly it reminded me of the big boss end fight scene of Bruce Lee's 'Enter the Dragon' movie .  I honestly couldn't tell what was real and what was reflection, and neither could an earlier resident as there was some sellotape over a cracked mirror.

The room was warm, clean and complete with all the ecoutrements required for a pleasant and hassle free business stay.

The bar service on the otherhand was non existant and table service was pretty awful. Primarily as there was only one guy working behind the bar. This was the only down side.

All in all, bar issues aside, this is a mighty fine hotel. It's certainly not a place to stay if you want to explore Barcelona city centre unless you are prepared to fork out for taxi's all the time, however as a busiess location close to the airport its pretty darn fine.   I would visit again.",4,2013,03,15
30,Excellent hotel for business / stop-over,"Located 10 minutes from Barcelona Airport and 10 minutes from the city centre, the Hesperia Tower hotel is an ideal location for those who wish to have a comfortable and relaxing short stop-over in Barcelona, or indeed, wish to organise a business conference with easy access from european locations.
The excellent standard of the bedrooms is matched by the service of the staff and the food within the restaurants.  The only disappointing element is that the rooftop restaurant is closed and the bar on the 3rd floor is only open for a few mid-day hours.
The business facilities are excellent with fully functional meeting rooms and a plenary room with intergrated systems and capcity for larger numbers of delegates.
Transport to and from the hotel is easy with the metro just a two minute walk away and taxi's available on the door.
A free airport shuttle service is also provided, but the timings are rather odd, so plan your transit accordingly.
Overall, an excellent experience and one that I hope to have again.",4,2013,03,15
30,Best (near) Airport hotel I have stayed in.,"This was my second time staying at the Hesperia Tower hotel, and I must say, it is one of the best for staying out near an airport for a number of reasons.  Staying in Barcelona is very expensive and noisy, but that is part of staying in a city, and the bus and taxi's make is easy to get around for sure, but the Hesperia is only about a 15 minute ride in on a good day by transit and $16 - $20 for a taxi to get you right down town.  What you get in return is a great view of the city in a really nice hotel. Once you are home at night the floor to ceiling windows in our ""suite"" were amazing - and the room was incredibly large with a full walk in closet, with plenty of hanger space and drawers. A full shower,  tub bathroom, and another two piece by the door. The  living area was large and very nice and comfortable, and the work table had a large surface area. Many nice touches as well, that make the room very nice.  But the bed and the windows really add to a great accommodation experience. You can push the button and the curtains open and close automatically to a spectacular view of the city. We upgraded to a suite which also included the hospitality suite on the 5th floor, and was a nice bonus, which we took advantage of a few times during a five nights stay, the liquor and other drinks are free and some snacks, but unless you plan on getting totally plastered every night there, I wouldn't recommend the upgrade for that, but for the suite itself. (We stayed in a regular room a few years ago and it was nice, but the suite with a city view makes it super relaxing and most of all the rooms is well soundproofed)  The hotel is quiet from the outside and inside. It has very good acoustics. 

   Also they say there is not much to do around there, but if you want to go for a very pleasant  walk and really get a feel for a none touristy area of Barcelona there are lots of local shops, restaurants, cafe's and plenty of wonderful local flavor just a 15 minute hoof away to a nearby Ramblas. (which are very popular in Europe) a boulevard, usually treed, that has lots of cafe's right on the island part, you walk up the middle and find an empty table you like. These are serviced by the bars and restaurants that line the sidewalk sections across a narrow roadway and the servers go back and forth. very enjoyable outing. The one near the Hesperia is  very small only a few blocks long, but with plenty of local flavor,  and the walk to get there takes you through neighborhoods and a nice treed bike and walking path, or I think it was only two stops on the subway. Because this Ramblas is not in a tourist area, we really enjoyed it, and it was not expensive at all to have lunch there. One place had the best breakfast and french fires I have tried. There is also a huge electronics store just next door to the hotel, which seems totally out of context, but they carry everything from Cameras to books, office supplies, greeting cards, computer stuff, so it has proven to be very handy.
   
     But for us, one of the best things about the Hesperia is the gym that it is attached to the hotel.  You have to pay an extra $12 eu a day (only if you go that day) but it is well worth it. The men's locker room is like a spa, there is an almost Olympic size pool, the work out area is a little crowded and busy but it's only for a few days so you get used to it. We sign up for the spinning classes which are a total treat in themselves and are included for the price of the gym. Aside from a great workout in Spanish our spins were very high energy, almost entertaining and the classes were full. (you have to sign up an hour before) and everyone in the class was singing along to the songs and yelling with the instructor who was amazing! I never once got lost in the spins, and was dripping from head to toe when done. A great, fun workout, then off to the the spa-like change room for a relaxing sauna and steam room.  The gym is a membership gym for locals so it's kept very clean and nice. Not at all like your typical hotel smelly, tiny workout room. Worth the stay alone if you like to workout when travelling. And if you are single? (you never know, there was some awfully nice locals there) 

     The only down side to this hotel if any is as some of the other reviews have stated - The food!  I'm not sure why they can't make better food here, but for some reason it's never been good.  But considering the proximity to the local ramblas, and town, it's never been an issue.  The service is second to none, and the rooms and common area are kept spotless. I highly recommended this place especially if you are only  passing through or have just one or two nights stay. It is nice to be right down town, but there are some compelling reasons for staying at the Hesperia tower as well.",4,2013,03,13
30,Love this hotel,"This hotel is beautiful, wonderful design.  My room was delightful - a lot of mirrors in the bathroom which can be a bit offputting first thing in the morning - but very quiet.  Breakfast buffet excellent  The food in the restaurant was well cooked and served, very tasty.  We held a conference there and I have no complaints whatever about the service and attention to detail.  Just a pity it is so far from the city centre, but on the other hand very convenient for the airport.",4,2013,03,13
30,high class hotel with top service,"two nights in that hotel and we will sure come back there. location is not the best, especially if you want to see barcelona, but the hotel by itself is very good and we can recommend this to all!
there have been good acces with public transport to the barcelona center. also airport was just 15 minutes with car away. it is a large design hotel. we felt good there. large room and we had a very nice view from our room!!! food - breakfast and the gourmetrestaurant - top!",4,2013,03,03
30,Great Design!,"Great Design! Top Hotel! although it is not in the very Center located, our Trip was very good and the Hotel is really awesome! Large and avery modern Design. Service was very friendly.
Perfect Restaurant (we have been there few times) and also Bar Service was perfect. Breakfast good and especially the Coffee was tasty.",5,2013,02,26
30,Excellent hotel near airport with easy access to the centre,"Stayed here on the first night of a 4 day trip to Barcelona (which was a shame because all the other hotels were terrible compared to this one). It was very easy to get to from the airport by bus. 

I absolutely loved this hotel it was clean and mordern with great a big windows in the room (and some of the lifts). 

My room was nicely decorated with a spacious area that had a walk in wardrobe, wash hand basin lots of toiletries and nice clean towels, dressing gown and slippers. The shower was very powerful and seperated from the toilet. I loved the hotel so much I was sad when I had to check out.

Breakfast was expensive and as I was treating myself - I didnt mind too much but I sure made sure I got my money's worth and didnt need lunch after that!!!

There is a shopping centre that is not too far away - I think it was about 10 mins on the bus. It has shops, places to eat and a cinema. 

I went to explore the are after I checked out and the hotel were kind enough to let me store my luggage and go back and pick it later.

Travelling to the city centre was very easy via the metro which isn't hard to undestand. So if you want a 5* hotel with the city centre prices choose Hesperia Tower! 

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hesperiea Tower and would definitely go back!!!",5,2013,02,26
30,excellent value for money,"Booked this for a weekend away with family. Out of town but very close to the Metro so it was easy and cheap to get around. This is a very friendly and welcoming hotel despite its size and I would definitely consider staying again. Large, comfortable and well equipped room and an excellent buffet breakfast! I booked this hotel  last minute on line and have to say that it offered excellent value for money.The staff are very helpful and everywhere appeared spotlessly clean. Came away feeling we had been well looked after. The hotel definitely added to an enjoyable long weekend away.",5,2013,02,21
30,Barcelona November 2012,"Good:
Amazing room! The bathroom was absolutely gorgeous, the shower was the best I've ever been in and it was spotlessly clean. The bedroom was wonderful, the d√©cor was so plush, with a ceiling-high headrest, a enormous and very comfy bed, a glass wall (with a button for the immense curtains), also spotlessly clean... the only thing that could've been better was the jarringly outdated TV! Not that it mattered too much. 
We only stayed for 3 nights so didn't see the staff much but they were polite when we did see them. 
The inside of the hotel was lovely throughout and very clean
The view was very nice at night but not amazing during the day
We had the breakfast buffet which was very tasty but overpriced
Frequent buses right outside the hotel
There were other amenities on hand but we never got around to using them 
Generally a very nice atmosphere

Bad Points:
A half hour bus ride into the city 
The surrounding area is not spectacular, mostly flats and a hospital or two
Not much in the way of shops close by, we didn't venture too far and ended up buying our snacks from the petrol station - although the men running it were very nice and funny 

Our stay was a short one and quite out of season, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel was the most gorgeous we have stayed in, including an amazing shower! Would definitely recommend to any holidaymakers, as long as you don't mind a bus ride to get into the city.",5,2013,02,19
30,Great service in the resturant,"The location of the hotel is great if you are leaving on a early flight out in the morning before 7 am as the taxi ride will cost about 20 to 25 Euro. Otherwise it will be a 3 min walk to the Metro L1 and a 20 min ride to the city center which is not bad.

Generally great service by the staffs in the hotel.  The service of the waiter in the resturnat was perfect especailly Cristain.  He was attentive to details and make sure that I was comfortable with my food and wine.  He offer to open another bottle of wine ( House pour)  as I did not like the one I was served.  Great lamb and salad.  Good job.",4,2013,02,19
30,Great Hotel!!,"This hotel was brilliant, the staff were so friendly and helpful. The rooms were very spacious and spotless.  It was a little bit away from the attractions, but the Metro was only a few minutes away and always run on time and was entertained by the musicians who frequented it each time.  Would definitively use this hotel again, definitively 5* hotel.",5,2013,02,19
30,Average,"The good: Very modern.  Kitchenette.  Free shuttle service from the airport.  Taxis always waiting outside the hotel (maybe it was because there was a convention there while we stayed).  Multi-ligual staff.
The bad: Not in the best location.  You need to travel to get to points of interest.  The suites (the apartment style portion of the property) did not have movies for rent but the tower does.  They told us we were going to get wifi in the rooms but the suites do not have it.  There was no business center.  Told us we were going to get breakfast included then they charged us for it. We had to call twice to get extra bedding.

Everything was very expensive for the what we received.",3,2013,02,18
30,We like this Hesperia Hotel!!!,"We like this Hesperia Hotel. There was a real and friendly Guestservice. We enjoyed our short Trip there and also our Friends, who have been there too, did say, that it is a good Hotel. Standard Room was cosy and all was clean. Bathroom fully good. There was Breakfast buffet with good things and a tasty Choice of hot Beverages too.",5,2013,02,18
30,Dissapointed..,"I have stayed in this hotel before once and had a pleasent experience - it was few years ago I believe and I remember the hotel had just opened recently.. but I am really disspointed how things have changed since then. I stayed in the hotel twice during 1 week (overnight stay when travelling through)- first time was upgraded to duplex suite (nice touch); second time I had booked a junior suite..
The things that made me upset are that on my arrival on both times there is not even a welcome bottle of water or fruits in the room. The bottled water on the menu is 7 euros for 75cl and you need to pay a delivery charge for it..Other thing thats weird is that even in the suites; you dont have tea/coffe making facilities. When I called guest services to ask for hot water to make tea in the room as I was feeling a bit ill - I was offered to come and get it myself for free of charge or call room services and pay 5 euros (+ another 5 if I needed condiments!) :S
The tower club is like a ghost town; spend there 30 minutes and never saw an employee...the few snacks left out where warm and mushy, probably been there for hours..
One of the reasons I decided to go back to this hotel as I saw they have a big gym and spa..well the gym is a public one so it was REALLY crowded..and I also tried to go and buy a creme and body scrub from the spa; turned out they dont have any products for sale..
all in all I expected a lot more from the hotel and I do not think I will be returning..",2,2013,02,06
30,Modern,"This hotel is very modern and a good place for our week long trip. 
I noticed the hotel never allowed for early check ins, and they either offered you an early check in for an extra price, or you can check in immediately, however you would get a smoking room. 
Being on a tight budget and wanting to go out and explore, we went with the smoking room.

Yes the room smelled of cigarettes, however it was clean.
Never bothered with the hotels restaurants as they were really expensive.

Location of this hotel is good and bad. Can get a little confusing trying to use their subway line/busses. Its near the airport, yet not too far from the city. The hotels shuttle service was used a couple of times, and it was for the most part reliable, however allot of times people got stranded at (for example the beach) for a couple of hours, because there wasn't enough room.",4,2013,02,04
30,Fantastic room and breakfast,"We had a great time in this NH hotel. The room upgrade was only 50‚Ç¨ to a suite because it was during the weekend and because we were traveling with our 1jr old baby, this was the best spend ever! The Room was actually 4 rooms at the 17th floor with great views and a huge bath, shower, sitting area and 2toilets! 

I used the gym twice, which was huge, but a bit crowded because it's also a public gym. 14‚Ç¨ per visit was also a bit too much!

We flew out early so had a early breakfast which was great! So many fresh food, really incredible! And because we were there on time it was like it was all for us!

I would recommend this hotel!",5,2013,02,03
30,Nice surprise with excellent rooms,"This is an excellent choice if you have business in the area but not really downtown Barcelona. Since we have business in the area I really liked the room with rainforest shower, separately enclosed toilet. The lighting is good once you find all the right buttons. Bed sleeps really comfortable. Breakfast selection is good and sufficient, with fresh fruits. Despite the height of the lobby, the bar is actually quite atmospheric.",5,2013,02,01
30,5 Star week,"My wife and I booked this as a ""mystery hotel"" offer - once we paid we discovered which hotel we had booked. We were not disappointed with the quality of this 5* Hotel but it is quite a distance from the city centre and whilst there is a metro station just over the road from the hotel and it is only a 20-25 minute journey into the city centre it meant that we could not just pop back to our room for a rest or to get changed before heading out for the evening. If we went again we would stay in the heart of the city. But if you want 5* quality and don't mind travelling in by train then this is a good place to stay - the rooms were stunning and had panoramic windows which overlook the city skyline, which is quite impressive of an evening.",5,2013,01,30
30,Great value for money Hotel,"The hotel is not situated in the center of barcelona but is well connected by metro within 20min roughly, so if you would like to be in the center of the city then its not your case ! i usually use hotels only for a very confortable sleep and Hesperia Towers offers great beds and good service !  i think its all you need after a day walking around the city !",5,2013,01,23
30,Ultra Modern,"The hotel is about 10min taxi ride from the airport. It cost 15euros to the hotel. They do have a limited airport shuttle service but not when we arrived.  They also will take you to downtown. Hotel is new and gorgeous. The rooms are spacious. The bed was comfortable. Our sink started to leak all over the floor but they came and fixed it right away. The only thing I wish they had was a coffee maker. They will not allow you to take it out from their restaurant so the only other option was room service. It was 10 euros because of the added delivery service. That got to be a bit expensive after 4 days of our stay.  The train station into town was just across the parking area and was very inexpensive and easy alternative to their shuttle service which was not often.  The hotel is attached to a health club and will let you work out for 16 euros a day. All in all, it was a very nice hotel.",4,2013,01,23
30,All form and no substance,"Stayed here for 3 nights during a conference and hotel was easy to get to from the airport. Just a 10 min taxi ride, or a 15 min bus journey to get to the airport. Quite a distance from the city centre and if I had a choice, i would not stay here again.

Fancy lifts that were a little difficult to comprehend, and certainly not user-friendly when one is rushing for time. Room is nice, very comfortable beds. Breakfast selection good. 

TV was not functioning when we arrived in the afternoon. Requested for someone to service it right away but despite more than 3 calls, no one came. Told us that the engineers were busy with other rooms so would not be able to come by that night, and without any apology - which really leaves me wondering how many rooms were having issues that night. No TV that night for us since no one came to fix it and I was waiting till beyond midnight. 

Had to follow up again the next morning before they sent someone to sort out the problem.

Another major issue I took with them was with the clothes hangers - we were caught in the rain when we had arrived at the hotel so my shirt was damp. Hung it up to dry and to my horror, discovered that the color from the clothes hangers provided runs! My yellow shirt was stained reddish brown! This is the first time I had ever encountered such a scenario in any hotel! Went downstairs to the receptionist to show them the problem and she was like ""Yes, the clothes hanger does run so we encourage only laundry services provided by the hotel."" Duh..... this sure wasn't mentioned to me upon check-in and other hotels certainly do not have this issue! Again, no apology offered but she did get it laundered without charge. Stain still isn't completely gone though. 

So guests beware! Do not ever hang anything damp on their clothes hangers!",2,2013,01,23
30,Fantastic hotel for the money,"We stayed here just after New Year for 4 nights the rooms were spectacular in every way
The only down side was the Aircon was awful it did not keep the room cool.We felt that the hotel did not have it switched on although they say they did.If this is the case do not book a room on the reception side of the hotel ,book it on the other side otherwise in the summer you will bake alive.
The staff were fantastic and so was the breakfasts.
You have to pay to use the leisure facilities but they are worth it.The hotel is about a 15 euro taxi ride out of the city center  or catch the subway there is a station right by the hotel next to the hospital.Buy a 10euro ticket gives you 5 trips and you can use it for as many people as you want.
We would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,01,21
30,great city view,"On my honeymoon I stayed with the Mrs. at hesperia tower we took the discounted rate with no breakfast but the staff was good to us and quickly upraded us to a room on the 21st floor we had a lovely view of the city and the room was large and very clean. I would reccomend the hotel. 

The only drawback was the fact that its in the corner of the town and travelling by the metro rail is the only option. The flipside is that its close to the airport.",4,2013,01,21
30,"Good hotel, crap location","I managed to squeeze in here at the last minute for a conference i was attending and all they had was a smoking room so i can't really comment on the room as i was lucky to get it. The hotel were brilliantly helpful getting me in and the room was nice apart from the smell of stale smoke. 
The hotel itself is huge and perfect for big conferences but if you want something close to the centre forget it - it's miles away.
The service was good and all the food we had was really tasty.",3,2013,01,16
30,Luxurious hotel far outside the center,"This is a luxurious hotel with all the amenities you'd expect. Location is pretty far from the center, but there is plenty of free parking around the hotel (garage is expensive!). The hotel has a free airport shuttle service, which can be handy. Rooms are great, but free wifi is not accessible everywhere in the room, so that can be a problem.",4,2013,01,14
30,"great hotel, good price","We were in Barcelona in April 2012. We were looking for a great hotel at a good price. If don't mind doing a 25-30 minutes metro ride to get to the city center, this hotel is an excellent choice.The nearest metro station is about 3-5 minutes walk. This hotel is located in a very quiet neighborhood. Our room was very clean, spacious and luxurious. Be didn't had breakfast at the hotel, because it was very expansive (it think around 18-20 Euro).
There was a free shuttle service to the airport and to downtown. 

We recommend this hotel. The service was excellent.",4,2013,01,13
30,Fantastic Stay,"Our stay in Barcelona was fantastic. The city is beautiful with loads to do and the whole trip was topped off with the wonderful Hesperia Tower Hotel. 

The impressive structure of the Hesperia Tower is about 7 miles from the city centre. However just opposite the Hotel is a hospital and on the far side of their car park, approximately 200 yards from the Hotel doors, is a metro station with a line that will take you right into the centre of the city (20 mins). The Hotel do offer a free shuttle bus service too at periodic times throughout the day, however if you want to get around town and see the sights I would recommend getting a travel pass for the metro, we got a 3 day travel pass for around 19 Euros each and we definitely got our money‚Äôs worth. 

Back to Hesperia, the room was immaculate, stylish and finished with high quality fixtures and fittings. The bathroom was stunning with lots of glass, double sinks, massage multi-jet power shower and useful toiletries including toothbrush and paste, razor and cream, shampoo, shower gel and sponge (very handy if you are only taking hand luggage like us). The bed was very comfortable and a range of pillows were on offer. We didn‚Äôt have room service in the end but the menu looked great and not extortionate. The breakfast was fresh, varied and delicious. There was cooked available (including baked beans!) although we stuck to continental, which was superb. But the most impressive thing was our view!! WOW!! We had a deluxe room on the 19th floor and the view from our panoramic window was mind blowing! And at night was just as breathtaking. 

We aren‚Äôt the biggest shoppers but if you are you will not be disappointed, La Rambla offered a huge range of retailers but we enjoyed The Marina at the bottom end of the road more. I would also recommend the Gaudi Apartments Casa Batll√≥ if you at all interested in art, design or architecture, also the Cathedral Sagrada Familia and Gaudi Park Park G√ºell (though be warned there is quite a walk from the Metro station to the park and a lot of it is up hill). 

Again this Hotel is great and Barcelona is a beautiful city, we will definitely go back!",5,2013,01,11
30,"Beautiful hotel, but far from everything","If you don't mind taking the subway, this is a good value for the price you pay - excellent rooms, very modern interior design, splendid hotel. But very expensive bar and restaurant and no supermarket around to buy anything.
Close to the subway, 5 min walking distance.
If I'll go again to Barcelona, I'll probably choose something closer to downtown - it takes around 1/2 hr to get from this hotel to any major attractions.
PS. If going to Barcelona, don't miss Monjuic!!:)",5,2013,01,10
30,Fabulous room,"This has been our second visit to this hotel and we were not disappointed. The Executive Suite is great for a family - the additional toilet is always appreciated.
The gym is well equipped and there is great access to the city via the underground.
A point to note is that in order for your child to receive the reduced breakfast rate you need to book it on arrival.",5,2013,01,08
30,not suitable for families with kids,"We wanted to visit Barcelona and we were there for 4 nights in July 2012 with our 3 daughters:( 11-12 and 14 years old)
overall it was OK ,  very comfortable bedrooms and nice breakfast but we were quite disappointed because:
1- no-family rooms were available, so we had to take a double-bedroom for us the parents + the suite for the girls. The girls loved it but not our wallet !
2- when we wanted to go the swimming pool, an other disappointment, because the pool is part of the attached leisure center , kids were not allowed !!!!
3- It's quite a drive to go to Barcelona city center.",4,2013,01,08
30,Very Nice Stay,"We had a great and comfortable stay when we were here for a week, we had hired a car because of the reviews about it being far from town and no metro etc but this was very untrue we drove into town and was about 5mins to get there and not much difference on the underground which there was one right across the road at the hospital and the service is fast and reliable. My problems were that being a 5 star hotel you expect the best since you pay so high but not much was included you had to pay for nearly everything, parking was ridiculous if you wanted to use the hotel parking i think it was 20euro a day otherwise you had to battle the surrounding streets for free parking which can be hard. also the pool and spa and gym you had to pay to use so we never did and then we got charged a huge city tax ontop of our prepaid but that was never mentioned anywhere that we would have to pay this. apart from all that the rooms were modern and very nice and the bed comfy, did not use the bar or restaurant as was too pricey so cant comment. I would stay again just be careful about the extras",4,2013,01,06
30,Excellent 5 star Hotel,"Nice 5 star Hotel next to the Hospital and Metro Station. Complimentery shuttle bus to the airport available. The rooms are excellent actually consisitng of two rooms, seperated by a heavy glass door.",5,2012,12,29
30,"Clean...but no soul, bad location, no atmosphere","We got a pretty cheap deal on travel republic, around ¬£250 for 2 for 3 nights room only, no breakfast, which is reasonable, but we were not that impressed. The room was clean and bed comfy. Thats about it. The location is terrible, miles out of town, in a fairly rough area next to the motorway so it really kills the vibe of being in a foreign city. Also you just feel like they are on the hard sell and if your not buying they are not interested! They even charged ¬£22 for us to use the spa, which isnt really a spa at all, just a pool with a jacuzzi at the end! Not impressed. There were no tea/coffee making facilities, the room service menu was rubbish and extortionate (¬£50 for 2 burgers and 2 drinks!), the tv and movie selection was tiny and poor. Also the bars were not all open. Generally very disappointing. But clean. Not a fun hotel. Sorry guys x",2,2012,12,29
30,Marvellous hotel,"Beautiful hotel and the staff are so so friendly.  I think they are the friendliest staff I have ever met in a hotel .  The rooms are gorgeous.  We had a beautiful view over the town.  The lifts are so fast.  Breakfast fantastic.  Well worth the staff. Will def be back again.
The metro station just across the round a bout.  20mins takes you in. Very handy and you don't notice the time going by.",5,2012,12,26
30,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed at the Hisperia Tower in Barcelona on 19 and 20th Dec 2012.  It is a beautiful hotel
with all the modern facilities.  It has a spacious bedroom and good size area for shower
and sink.  Beautiful curtains, bed linens and a homely feeling.  The hotel is about 10 min
taxi drive away from the main shopping street in Barcelona and we paid about $17 euros
to go there.  The hotel also have a good selection of spa and massage services at a 
reasonable rate.   The only pity is that the room we stayed in do not come with a bath
tub , just a standing shower room.",5,2012,12,21
30,good service,"really good service i enjoyed my stay and going back for my birthday next year.The breakfast was  really good. The driver was really helpfull and give us direction as to  where to go for sight seeing. Thanks.
      ",5,2012,12,19
30,"Mixed: some good points, but some not so good","First the good points. We had a suite for a very reasonable price (230 Euro per night). Lots of room, but strangely laid out so was a bit short of flat spaces to place suitcases down. Good view our of the windows (we were on the 25th floor).  The restaurant on the 2nd floor is pleasant and the food of a reasonable standard. The food is expensive, but no more so than normal for a 5* hotel. The swimming pool is large (25m) and empty the first time we used it. There is quite a nice spa area too, with some very impressive jaccuzi beds. Reception staff were very friendly. Location is well outside town, but there is a metro very nearby. 

Bad points. The rooftop restaurant is closed and nobody knows when it will reopen. As this is advertised extensively on their website and internally in the hotel,  I found this very annoying. The executive lounge is disappointing. It is a huge and attractive room, but the ""evening tapas""   consisted of a few spoons of salmon wrap accompanied by a cold pumpkin soup. Both in quantity and quality this was very disappointing.",3,2012,12,12
30,Stunnig Hesperia,"Since the moment I get to the reception I get surprise with this lovely hotel. When get to my room couldn‚Äôt believe on the view and such nice bathroom and shower. The hotel is just outside the city centre; however, it is located very near to a metro...about a five minute walk away :). Also they offer me a shuttle from the hotel to airport. The only thing I didn‚Äôt see as concierge desk, but if u needs some extra information u just need to go to the reception and one the receptionist can help u. I will return on the amazing hotel",5,2012,12,06
30,Superb airport hotel with shuttle,"We began and ended our trip to Provence by staying at this wonderful, modern hotel that's close to the Barcelona airport.  Number one, it's not as easy to find free shuttle service to and from airports in Europe as it is in the U.S. and although the Hesperia service is rather limited, it is available and free.  You have to know the pick up and drop off schedule as it doesn't run every half hour or so as we're more accustomed to in the states.

The hotel is an ultra modern high rise with, colorful and dramatic architectural features, restaurants and clean small suite type rooms with a bath that can be closed off from the bedroom.  The showers are ultra modern with luxurious fittings and there's lots of closet space, a safe and nice heavy robes.  The beds are very comfortable, there's a good size flat screen tv and free wifi.  

One of the best features of this hotel is that's only a short couple of blocks to the  metro which can have you in the las ramblas section in about twenty minutes.  We ate twice at an authentic tapas restaurant again within a short walk  of the hotel, that was recommended by the very friendly and helpful front desk staff.  The food (much more than just tapas) and wine was good and a lot less expensive than the hotel restaurants.  The hotel does offer free coffee and pastries if you're up early enough but closes off entirely at seven AM.

Now for the very best feature; for a beautiful airport hotel in a very cosmopolitan city we spent approximately $100 a night for the three nights we were there.  We booked our first and last night through Tavelocity and booked the additional night through EuroBookings at the same rate that Travelocity charged.  We thought these prices were unbelievable especially when we saw posted rates at the front desk that looked like some people were paying around $400 a night.  We wondered about the disparity but quietly paid our bills and didn't ask questions.  We thought this was an incredible deal, all things considered.

In summary, we searched quite a bit for BCN hotels that met our needs and    we were very happy to have found the Hesperia Tower,",5,2012,12,03
30,Super Luxury Hotel,"Although it was not in the Center from Barcelona, it was very great there - a really spectacular Hotel - and we will also come there soon again. Good dining in the high Restaurant and very professional Service everywhere in the Hotel. Top outfitted Businesscenter and ver good Room Design - our Room had a pretty black and goledne Intriour - wich was great!!!",5,2012,12,02
30,Excellent!!!,"Excellent hotel, outstanding quality of service and accommodation...Staff polite and friendly. Hotel was spotless and clean...Room had an amazing bathroom with an awesome shower...Couldnt fault the hotel at all....Would definately return..

The hotel is just outside the city centre, however, it is located very near to a metro...about a five minute walk away :)",5,2012,12,01
30,Great English-Speaking Front Desk!,"Read the advice/reviews on here and they helped a lot. Free shuttle from the hotel to the center of town (Gotic Quarter or Gothic Quarter) saved us a cab fare (no free shuttle back, though). The front desk was VERY helpful in giving directions - the metro is cheap (buy a T-10 to share to save money for multiple people &/or multiple trips).
They did have a hair dryer under the bathroom sink. The conversion (when we were there last week) was .66 US  to the euro's 1, so you had to do the math to figure out what was pricey. Room service was pricey (about $75 for just a cesar salad and pork entree and they forgot the potato) but there is virtually no where near to eat dinner.
The advice on here to get an even-numbered room above the 18th floor was spot on! Our friend ASKED for an even-numbered room but got an odd-numbered room without our fabulous view of the city. So, check to be sure that you get an even-numbered room before you leave the lobby. (He could have gone back downstairs to ask for a better room, but was too tired to bother.)
No coffee pot or tea in the room and no microwave, so the pressure is on to use the mini bar/snacks (we took our own snacks - cashews, chips, chocolates and saved a bundle) or order $$ room service.
If you do nothing else while here, plan a day to make the hour trek to Montserrat. An unbelievable place that will forever change you. The boy's choir sings at 1, so you have to get an early start to get there to hear them. The museum has a stunning art collection. All etched into the side of a mountain. Amazing place!!",4,2012,11,18
30,4 Nights in spring.. April.,"I stayed here with my partner in crime for 4 nights, Quite new to the hotel scene. But more than impressed with the hotel as a whole. The full length windows in the room offer some sparkling views by night, a bit pants by day though, and if you have the side facing away from the center then even more so.. But the lights by night were pretty impressive. Wi-Fi was a little temperamental on the 15th floor, I could connect in the bathroom but not a few feet away on the bed.. Less than comfortable facebook updating!! 

Set in an urban neighbourhood. Not much to say on this. Ventured out on the first evening in the dark and found a nice little cafe selling tapas. Ordered way to much, nobody told me they would be so generous with the portions! Some people said neighbourhood was slightly intimidating. Meh, depends on if you look out of place really. 

Is a horrendous distance from the centre and attractions by foot.. However, this should never put you off. The metro is opposite in the hospital car park, and in my opinion, a million and three times better than any tube/metro I've ever used. Spacious, clean, and ultimately on time. They offer up metro tickets valid for multiple days, these are such incredible value it's unreal. The metro will get you everywhere you could want to go, even lost in the suburbs if you try hard enough :s 

Ultimately, the hotel was awesome, slightly pricey in the lobby bar, but kinda expected really. 6 euros for a small heineken (but free crisps). Helpful staff with advice given on request. Also free shuttle service to and from the airport, no good for late evening flights though.

Oh and weirdly, my key card packed up twice.",5,2012,11,14
30,20 minutes from downtown - a world away from the prices,"Stayed here for two days.  The hotel is directly opposite the last station on the L1 (which is the central TMB - Metro line).  It takes 20 minutes to get to Plaza Catalunya - which despite what one reviewer wrote is pretty reasonable unless you are going to fork out the money to stay on Las Ramblas.  I will note that other reviews complain about the cost of ""extras.""  Two things - (1): That's why they are called extras, e.g., you can pay a rate which includes breakfast and (2): welcome to Spain.  

The hotel is located about 1 km from Ramblas Just Oliveras which is a nice little urban center that has many restaurants and shops.  Walking in the pedestrian pathway between the apartments north of the hotel also brings you through many cafes, restaurants and food stores.  

Lastly, the accommodations at this hotel are excellent.  The rooms are large - if you reserve a double bed, you can get one, and the shuttle to downtown is a nice touch if you don't want to bother with the Metro.  There is also a lot of train traffic through the Avenida Carrilet station (FGC) which is just at the beginning of the Ramblas Just Oliveras.",4,2012,11,14
30,5 day get away,"Stayed at the Hesperia Tower hotel for a 5 day getaway break at the end of October, We arrived late at the hotel and got to our room to find it was a twin when we booked a double, I went to reception the next morning and said they were fully booked and could upgrade me for very expensive extra price so I tried again later and another receptionist managed to move us into a double. The hotel is very far away from everything so we used the metro station which is 15 stops away to the centre. There is a shuttle bus that runs to the centre but it does not run very frequently and theres not much much room on the bus so if you want to catch it que up a little before hand, also the shuttle bus stops running at 8 oclock in the evening so if you have a late flight don't rely on the shuttle, we got a taxi which cost us 20 euros and the hotel is only a 10min drive from the airport. The reception staff was'nt as helpful as I hoped they didnt want to go the extra mile and you had to ask for everything yourself, I asked one of the reception directions to a shop and she hung up on me! We did'nt eat or drink at all in the hotel as it was very overpriced!! The pool and spa you have to pay an extra 18 euros each and you can't use unless you have a swimming hat so we didnt use this. Overall its a lovely hotel for a few nights but I wouldnt recommened staying for a city break as it a bit out of the way!",3,2012,11,07
30,Slick Ultramodern Hotel convenient to Airport,"After a month in Spain and France, we needed a place to spend our last night in preparation for an early flight out of Barcelona. This hotel had been on our curiosity list for Barcelona when we first began planning the vacation because of the ;high scores given by other tripadvisor reviewers until we realized it was out of town but its location is perfect for arrive and or depart.

The lobby is slick. You walk on glass plates over water and grass. the elevators require you to enter your destination on an interactive screen in the elevator lobby and the elevator is announced by number, your floor is programmed into the elevator so you needn't push a floor when you enter and the waits are short.Walking down towards the rooms the entry doors are angled to the corridor and paired two to a side. As you enter the slim rooms you first encounter a heavily mirrored bath facility with good closet space, twin sinks, separate stalls for the toilet and the astoundingly complex and gratifying spray anywhere shower.

A curtained glass door opens to the bedroom with two twins (in the inexplicable north eastern Spanish mode of two beds pushed almost together in a king bed formation but sheeted and blanketed as separate twins. there are modern furnishings, a dozen light switches and electronically controlled window curtains on the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the roadways in the airport area.",4,2012,11,05
30,Don't even go there!!!,"This hotel is certainly not one you want to go to if you want to be in Barcelona! It's not in Barcelona it's miles away, in fact 25 minutes on the tube!  It's not 5 star at all, I've been all round the world and this is definitely not 5 star!  You have to continually ask for things, like bacon, eggs, orange juice.  Pay a bit more and stay in the centre, if you want 5 star go to the meridian or the colon, sounds an awful name but it looks an awesome hotel, and they are central.  Even if you are going to the football, which by the way is awesome, pay that bit extra to stay in the centre,",3,2012,11,05
30,Beautiful Hotel but extras were expensive.,"This hotel is beautiful from the moment you walk into the reception, the reception area, the room, the spa and the bar we all wonderful. The only problem with this hotel is the unbelievable price of the extras, breakfast, use of the spa and food in the restaurant. So it was lovely to stay here but only if you are willing to pay the high prices. The Metro was just outside the hotel and there was a courtesy bus available to bring you into the city centre to eat if you wanted to but it takes about 20 minutes to get there from the hotel.",5,2012,11,01
30,Excellent.. Very nice modern hotel,"Good size rooms with really amazing views.. Modern styl.. The service is excellent..rooms are clean.. Location is 10 min. From airport and 15 minutes from placa de catalonia.
Metro station is just 1 min. Walk from the hotel. 
Breakfast is very good.. Many varieties...
",4,2012,10,28
30,Absolutely stunning hotel,"We stayed here in April after getting a brilliant deal on lastminute.com. The hotel was a 5 minute bus ride from the airport (not the main, central one). We were checked in quickly, the reception is very clean and modern. The lifts are glass and different lifts take you to different floors, it's all electronic too. Our room was beautiful, you enter through the bathroom, which was decorated in a shiny black marble effect. Lots of space for clothing. There were also his/hers sinks, which I loved and complimentary bathrobes/slippers. The shower was amazing, with 3 types of settings; large circular shower head above you, hand held shower spray and a jacuzzi like shooting body spray like shower, very impressive. 
The bedroom was spacious with a big comfortable bed, tv and iPod speaker. The view from our room was fantastic, and we were only on the 8th floor. The room was a smoking room, but didn't smell stale or smokey. Our air dryer didn't work, but it was replaced really quickly.
We had problems checking out as our key was deactivated, but it was resolved fairly quickly. 15 minutes from city centre by metro.
Only let down was not being able to eat in the restaurant. Apparently they were fully booked!
All in all had a lovely time and would love to return to this beautiful hotel.",5,2012,10,27
30,Hesperia in Barcelona,"A great hotel with beautiful amenities and views of Barcelona.  Ultra modern and easily acsesessible from center city and all area attractions.  Food and beverage were expensive but the rooms, especially the bathrooms were exceptionally comfortable and attractive.  The only negatives were the high cost of using the indoor pool [approx. $15] and the fact that the revolving restaurant on top of the hotel is no longer operating",5,2012,10,23
30,Unique Design Better Because Of It,"Truly unique design even for the hallways.Modern and fast elevators,great for the many floors. Practically no wait. Good smiling reception in spite of the many persons checking in. 
Great view from high floor-breathtaking. Plenty of sleeping room and mirrored dressing area and good bath features. Que early for the van free service to downtown, it gets busy. If you miss it there is a walkable Metro station. Outstanding lobby. Superb breakfast buffet with many hot entries and eggs. If you did not booked the buffet with your room, the front desk offered a good price at check in time. Easy ride to train station, plenty of taxi waiting outside. What you get for the money is outstanding.",5,2012,10,22
30,Good hotel but far from the center,"The hotel is impressive, 27 floors with a view and a building next door with suites. I stayed at the suites. The breakfast was superb, the rooms were clean and modern. The WiFi however was horrible, no reception in the room, good reception in the lobby but data speed was shaped and almost not usable for normal usage, it also had a timeout so you had to re-logon on the portal page afer some minutes of inactivity. There is a Metro line and a bus stop nearby, but it really is a long way from the center. They offer a free shuttle to and from the airport. The bar offered (too) expensive drinks...",4,2012,10,15
30,Tremendous deal at the last minute.,"We got a tremendous deal at the last minute through the eponymous website. The concierge was very helpful. Although the hotel has a free shuttle service from the airport, we were arriving to late at night to benefit from it. We were recommended a taxi 20 euros) or the bus (number 46 from right outside the terminal to Hospital de Belvitge, first stop, at 2 euros each). Very pleasant hotel, a bit far out from the centre, though on a direct tube line to the centre (Catalunya). Room was very well furnished with a great view, high up in the tower.",4,2012,10,14
30,Had an amazing night here,"We booked a night here to be near the airport, and what a great hotel. we had a room on the 21st floor and had an amazing view over Barcelona. We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was amazing, the only let down was the drinks was expensive. When we got back to our room there was a huge bottle of cava and strawberries sat waiting for us. Had an amazing breakfast before we left.... cannot wait to go back and stay a few days at this hotel. Metro just over the road so ideal for exploring.

The power shower in the room was something else and the bed was so comfy",5,2012,10,12
30,Modern Hotel,"Stayed in this very modern and stylish hotel just one night to attend a concert.  Reception staff very helpful and courteous.  Stayed in room 2210 (22nd floor) floor to ceiling glass afforded us excellent views over Barcelona could see Sagrada Familia faintly in the distance as well as Montjuic.  Great decor in very spacious rooms, very good bathroom and excellent shower.  Excellent breakfast. Well located with regards transport links but not at walking distance. Would definitely stay again for an overnight for concert etc, maybe not for a longer break as it can be a bit too out of the way and not in the city center.",5,2012,10,12
30,"Excellent, but les for those who prefer ""ambience""","I stayed for 3 nights in the Hesperia. The staff were outstanding. Very courteous, friendly and smiling. The rooms ( I stayed on the 25th floor) were very spacious and well equipped. I forgot to ask for NON smoking, in fact I was surprised to see an ashtray when I entered the room. My only comment would be the elevators, it has a computerized system  but still, it can be quite a long wait at peak times. The outside view, in particular the close environment is not spectacular, it's probably 10 minutes away from the airport. Convenient location for business, not for a city trip if you like to be in the city center",4,2012,10,11
30,Modern hotel!,"Stayed at this hotel w/ my friend for 3 nights Friday 5th October - Monday 8th October due to attending a pop concert nearby (ish) and for a mini break away for a birthday. 

Airport transfer roughly 20 minutes.
Free bus service which runs at certain times of the day, this is only from terminal 1 so if you land in terminal 2 like i did you got to dash your way there! 

Front lobby very modern looking with huge sofas with plenty of magazines to read/huge tv and bar. Great to watch the football!! 

Reception staff very friendly. Very good at giving directions. Nothing too much trouble. 

Room (I was in room 1809 - so on the 18th floor) was cleaned every day throughout my 3 day stay. Great views over city, fresh towels daily. 

FREE AIRCON! Only thing which was free i think?!!!

Ipod dock in room too; which I LOVED!!!!! 

No kettle or tea cups - although this was because they just want you to use room service. (which was dear - 4.50 for a cup of tea!) 

Mini bar was average price for the drinks/chocolate. 

Breakfast menu for room service (served from 6:30am until 11:30am) does not state what foods are suitable for vegetarians. I ordered fried eggs, thinking this would come with toast. However, this came with bacon so was a bit disappointed. Lucky my friend had ordered pancakes so i wasn't left hungry!
This could be the same if someone orders scrambled eggs, so just a warning it does come with meat. 

Toilet had a phone in it, which was pretty funny!
Plenty of mirrors around the bathroom and bedroom. 

It's 12 euros to use the pool/sauna etc, but it's definitely worth the money. Before I came here I thought it was a bit of a con that the hotel charged to use it. 

Yes, it's out of the way of the main city centre, but the metro link is located by the hospital directly opposite the hotel. This is roughly a 5 minute walk, and trains are pretty frequent. 

Get a T-10 ticket for 9 euros  as this lets you use the underground up to 10 times. So this works out a lot cheaper than the 2 euros one way ticket. 

Takes about 30 minutes to get to centre, have to change  @ urquinaona (yellow line) to get there. 

Underground does get busy, but don't they all??? Although it's good as the hotel is located at the end of the red line, so the last few stops it empties out. 

Taxi rank directly opposite hotel. Costs 15 euros to get to airport, although apparently if you walk to another metro station called Bellvitge which is located about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, a tram will take you directly to the airport. (or damn near enough - i didn't use it, but ask at reception & they'll tell you the details)

Good hotel. Don't let the location put you off. Yes, it's not in a ""picturesque"" area, but it's a really modern hotel with transport links.",4,2012,10,08
30,Only good impressions,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in the end of August and we really enjoyed our weekend in Barcelona. Rooms and bathrooms are very big and are featured with stylish and comfortable furniture. 
We had only room fare and were offered to pay EUR18 per person per night for breakfast which we declined, so no idea what it's like.
The staff is very helpful and polite.  
Although the hotel is not 'walking' distance from the city centre, it doesn't take more than 20 mins to get to Catalunya Square by tube and it's very conviniently located close to the airport which was very important to  us because we could extend our sleep as we had a red-eye morning flight.
All in all, the hotel really deserves its five stars and I will definitely stay there during my next visit to Barcelona.

30,Good Value 5 Star,"We got this hotel on a deal, normally 5 star is outside our holiday budget.  We booked the breakfast included option.  Very nice hotel, very modern, very comfortable, staff helpful.  Breakfast well worth the additional cost.  Its a bit out of Barcelona and this is reflected in the rate so dont be expecting a local shopping/nightlife experience but with a metro station 3 minutes walk away the city is easy to get to.  They do a shuttle to/from the airport which is great and a shuttle into town but with the metro so close wouldnt worry.  One thing to be mindful of however that this hotel considers itself 5 star and bar/restaurant prices reflect this so be warned.  Decor in the room is very modern and moody possibly a bit much for some tastes but overall on the deal we had excellent value with easy access to bacelona",4,2012,10,01
30,A haven between Airport and City,"Very enjoyable and comfortable.
Metro station across the road, 230Mt., from Hotel front door.
Hotel Breakfast is expensive but next to the Colegio Juan XX111 a 350Mt. stroll there are very good coffee shops, a bakery and small supermarket.
In GOOGLE Earth the shadow of the Hotel points the direction.",5,2012,09,28
30,Modern and Clean but way out of Barcelona,"I have just returned from a 3 day business stay at this hotel. As all of my meetings took place here it was the obvious place to stay but please don't book if you are hoping to see Barcelona....it is not near the centre, and is not really a tourist hotel. 
The rooms are spacious and clean, if a little dark...it is all black tiles and mirrors. Nice shower and bathroom area, and comfortable bed.
Breakfast was a buffet and there was plenty of choice...lots of fresh fruit!
I didn't get to use the swimming pool or spa but they looked nice.
Again, handy for business conferences but this would never be my choice of hotel in my favourite city. Stay in the centre where the best of Barcelona is on your doorstep.
",4,2012,09,27
30,"Modern, clean hotel","Just got back from 4 days at Hesperia towers. Lovely modern rooms, great city views, lovely powerful shower and a great size room. iPod docking station and good hairdryer included aswell as dressing gowns and slippers. Only downside was we had smoking room, however there was a slight smell but nothing too horrible. Freeshuttle bus to the centre and airport was a nice idea as you are a good 20 minute train journey from the centre however we didn't mind using the train very good service and price and quite nice to get out of the busy centre at the end of a long day. Drinks ate expensive at the bar but then that is the case with all 5 star hotels. We found the service to be very good. We asked for an iron and they brought one up to the room no problem and gave us a map of the area. Overall great stay- just bare in mind the location and smoking room situation. ",4,2012,09,27
30,Very modern & new...but horrible customer service...,"We had such high hopes for this hotel since it was new, looked amazing, and it seemed to have a great reputation...little did we know that it'd be the worst hotel we'd ever stayed at in terms of customer service. Arriving to the hotel at 11pm, and after waiting in line for (no exaggeration) 45 minutes, we were given an unbearable smoking room after we'd booked a non-smoking one. We called the front desk from the smoking room to ask for a new room and we were told someone would be up to see us in five minutes. Those five minutes turned into a half an hour and so we trekked back down to the lobby with all of our luggage. Once again, we were forced to wait another thirty minutes after which we were spoken to in a very condescending tone about how a non-smoking room is never guaranteed. We were forced to listen to this entire tirade by the employee, even though, they had other non-smoking rooms available and could've just smiled and given us another room very easily. Instead, showing absolutely no sympathy for how long we had waited in line and in the smoking room, the employee treated my wife and I (who were there for our 1st anniversary) like we had done something wrong & continued to lecture us...at which point I asked to speak to the manager and I was told the individual berating us was the night manager...After finally getting our room, a standard room, we also realized, every single part of the hotel could only be used by paying additional fees...no matter if it was the gym, pool, sauna...anything...it was all extra...nothing was included...and not just a fee of 5 euros...I'm talking an extra 25 euros to use the pool...25 euros to use this...and that...basically...it was not worth staying here...especially considering it takes 20 minutes at least on the metro to get to the downtown Barcelona area...Our hotel experience pretty much ruined our mood and our stay...",2,2012,09,24
30,Great hotel,"Although a bit odd looking, this hotel is very luxurious, with comfy beds, good ir conditioning and gret views. Convenient metro link, free shuttle service to town and also to airport. Nearby shop if you do not fancy the pricey food. Also nice health club attached. Would recommend to anyone, and would stay again",5,2012,09,19
30,Excellent Hotel but a bit of a way out from central Barcelona.,"Excellent hotel. Very modern room with all the modern amenities and all the usual gadgets. Comfortable bed. Bathroom was very good although no bath but a very good shower. Make sure you get a room which looks over the Montjuic. You get a good view of the Olympic Park.

The only downside is that it is a bit out of the way to central Barcelona but there is an underground line close by. A taxi costs ‚Ç¨10 to the city centre. However, this is reflected in the prices for the room. Very good food too in the restaurant.

I would stay here again as the extra distance is worth it for the price you pay.",5,2012,09,18
30,What it does it does well,"Just got back from my annual conference in Barcelona. We stayed at the Hesperia Tower, and as I said in the title of my review.. What it does it does well!

The guestrooms are smart. The conference facilities good. The meeting spaces and public areas are vast. The staff were excellent... and it is value for money!

Ok.. So its not in the greatest location, and therefore may not be ideal for a romantic break or sightseeing trip of this fabulous city... but as a conference facility it does its job very well.",4,2012,09,18
30,Hesperia Tower 5 star?? average service not worth writing home about.,"On First  arriving at the airport we had a bit of difficulty actually locating the shuttle bus stop as we landed at Terminal Two and the stop is located at Terminal 1. In the end we called the hotel and were told that the next bus would be at 11:50. Unfortunately as it took us a little while to get from terminal 2 to terminal 1 we missed it and having not been informed at the time that it was the last bus we ended up waiting for 30 mins before we decided to call back again to find out when the next bus would arrive, only to be informed that there wasn't one for a few hours until the late afternoon (yep we were off to a great start) and that we should take the the 46 bus or a cab to the hotel. 
Slightly annoyed that we hadn't been told this information when we first called we proceeded to take the bus to the hotel which luckily was a short journey.

First impressions pulling up to the Hotel was that the building was quite unusual and impressive looking. When we went inside to the reception area it was a nice cool modern looking space. However when we went to check in we were told that there were actually no non smoking rooms with double beds available and that we would have to wait perhaps an hour or so before there would be, or if we prefered we could have a room with two single beds instead and push them together (yes seriously) or a double bed room on the smoking floor.

Tired and slightly annoyed we decided to wait until a room came available as the thought of staying in a room that stank of smoke was not exactly that appealing. 

After waiting for about half an hour in the seating area next to the reception rather than being called over and told that a room had become available it wasn't until myself and my partner went back over to enquire whether the room on the smoking floor would smell of smoke as we were tired of waiting around having been up since 4am, to which we were told that it most likely would, that we asked if there were any non smoking rooms available yet and were told that there was. Making me think that if we hadn't gone over we would have been left to sit there for who know's how long while said room was given to other people. 

Finally having checked in we took the futuristic touch screen lift to our floor and used our key card to enter our room.

The room was very nice looking with two sinks, toilet, wardrobe and waterfall shower seperated from the main bedroom area by a frosted glass door. 
With a ceiling to floor window, being on the 10th floor we had a pretty good view, though unfortunately as our room was facing towards the airport our view consisted of the hospital and motorway,  but then you win some you loose some. 

On further inspection of the room we realised that we had no iron, no kettle and no fridge apart from the tiny one containing the mini bar. With no room to hold anything else such as a bottle of water it is apparently checked everyday to ensure that you are charged around 4euro's plus if you drink any of the tiny bottles it contains. 

Calling reception to enquire if we could get a kettle with which to boil hot water we were informed that that there were none and if we wanted tea we should order it from room service. 

We also asked about the free wifi in the room and were told that to log in we should make up our own username and password. Needless to say it did not work and we called back again and spoke to someone else who gave us the correct information rather than just making something up.

After settling in a few days later we decided to visit the indoor pool  and gym that we had seen as being listed as part of the hotel amenities on both the expedia, ebookers and last minute websites. Unfortunately this is actually missleading as the hotel itself has no pool or gym and instead guests are expected  to use the pool and gym of the nextdoor health club which is not a free service if you are staying in one of the hotels standard rooms and actually inccurs a charge of 12 euros per person per day.

To sum up I do not feel that the service we have recieved has been of five star quality, I feel that we were missled to believe that there were certain on site amenities inclusive in the price which was not the case.
For the price we paid we could have got the amenities we wanted and  better service at a much cheaper 4* hotel closer to the city.  

We Travel often and have stayed at a variety of hotels from 3* to 5* and I feel that  our stay at the Hesperia Tower Hotel has been pretty average and the service nothing to write home about.",3,2012,09,17
30,Luxury apartment hotel,"We needed a long weekend away and Barcelona seemed a great place to unwind.  My girlfriend found a good offer at the Hesperia and we had a large suite, which included a living room with flat screen TV, a bedroom with flat screen TV, a separate dressing room, two separate toilets, and a very large bathroom with a vast shower and a very large spa jacuzzi bath.  

The suite was excellent: quiet, and extremely well laid out.  However, the decoration was looking a little tired, with some of the furniture in need or a clean, and a little bit banged up.  And while the suite had two flat screen TV's there was no HD signal, in-house movie or on demand service, and the only channels were the standard hotel 4:3 news services (BBC, CNN, FOX, etc).

The included buffet breakfast was spectacular, and well worth the price, with a very large selection of hot and cold dishes to suite any taste and style.  The hotel had a members bar/club  that provided complementary drinks (beer, scotch, gin) and small snacks.  However the evening meal in the restaurant was well over-priced for the standard of food: which wasn't bad, merely priced at a level that suggested a chef much better than that which was served.

The hotel is some considerable distance from the city centre (25 minutes on the metro) in a very industrial part of Barcelona next to a housing estate consisting of a domino series of Stalinist tower blocks, and the Oncology wing of the local hospital.  It is clearly a good conference hotel that had hoped for greater things, and one can imagine the developers promising to bring jobs and money into the local community.  The location - both the distance from Barcelona and the locale - mean that unless you stay in the city centre, or stay in the hotel, there is nothing to see or do, and only one very sorry Kebab restaurant in the nearby street.

Connected with the hotel is a gym and pool, but these are public services; and while there is easy access to the facilities via a hotel corridor, you do run into a gym filled with fit young men and women pumping iron - which can be a bit intimidating if you are a middle-aged couple looking for a relaxing swim.  One one occasion the pool was taken over by a home load of retired people who were swimming in a rather confused manner.

The experience was good, and my girlfriend loved the jacuzzi bath, but I would not rush to revisit the hotel due to the location and time taken to get into the city.",4,2012,09,15
30,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"Stayed 4 nights at the end of a cruise. N H group hotel so standards are very good 5 star, clean and tidy with friendly staff. Room excellent with nice features and a large shower room. Did not eat in the hotel but several guests told us it was great for breakfast. Several cafes nearby selling beer, wine, cafe con leche filled baggettes etc at a very reasonable price. Free shuttle to Barcelona centre (but not back.) Metro station 5 minutes walk from hotel that is 20 minutes to/from Barcelona. Also free shuttle to airport which was handy. Please note shuttle goes to terminal 1 so if you are flying from terminal 2 leave time to get across using the free airport shuttle between the terminals. For metro get the T10 tickets giving 10 rides at less than half price. 2 people can use the ticket by putting it through twice. Overall excellent and we will be back.",5,2012,09,14
30,Nice Hotel,"Lovely hotel quite a way out from the main town but we knew this from reading other reviews.This was not a problem as the hotel provide a courtesy bus a few times a day and the metro is just across the road.On arriving we we greeted by a very pleasant lady whose attitude changed when we decided not to take her offer of an upgrade as we knew we would not be spending much time in the room. The standard room was more than adequate,lovely bathroom which takes  a bit of getting used to as there are mirrors everywhere. There is a lovely cafe around the back of the hotel called 365 which sells lovely fresh rolls cakes and do a lovely coffee for a few euros also in same area are a few local bars.Make sure you check your bill daily (which can do on the television in your room ) as someone put two breakfasts 48 euros on our room an our last day,when my husband queried this with the lady on reception she said we must have had breakfast and walked out without signing for it which would have been impossible as we never had breakfast in the hotel all the time we stayed as we used the 365 cafe. It was quite embarrasing as she obviously did not believe us.The hotel should change there policy and make people sign before they have their breakfast. They did take it off the bill but it did spoil the end of a lovely holiday",4,2012,09,14
30,"Upscale, modern, classy.","We stayed here a couple of nights leading up to our Mediterranean cruise with MSC, hoping to explore Barcelona a bit.  What a great hotel. The building itself is a work of art.  We were warmly greeted and checked in with no difficulty.  

Even though there are only 4 elevators for highrise building, we never waited much for one to arrive.  You enter your desired floor at a console in the elevator lobby, and it tells you which one to go to.  This works very efficiently!

As you rise, you experience the reveal of the city that is a rapid ascent to your room floor.

The rooms themselves are spotless, quiet, and adorned with high-quality finishes and modern decor.  The bathroom was luxurious, finished in dark, highly polished onyx-type stone, and walk in shower.  Great water pressure and lots of hot water available. The toilet was contained in a separate frosted glass room, with accent lighting.  The only minus I might say is closet space, there isn't a ton of it, but it's adequate.

The restaurant on the 3rd floor was what one would expect in a 4 or 5 star hotel, with the price to match.  Excellent selection of wines.  Didn't make it to the restaurant at the top unfortunately, as it was not open at the times we wanted.

The hotel is very close to the public transit subway/metro, giving ready access to nightlife and sights. As well, not too far from the airport, which is convenient.

I would definitely stay here again, especially if I can get a preferred rate like we did when we came.",5,2012,09,13
30,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the Hesperia tower last year and we were very impressed with the hotel, staff, price, etc...Definitly a great place to stay in Barcelona.  The only inconvenience is the location.  It is far from the downtown area but across the street from the line 1 metro station.  We are going back to Barcelona this November  and we are looking forward to a great stay with them once again..",5,2012,09,09
30,"Nice hotel, but...","We stayed at this property on 2 seperate occasions during our trip to Spain, the location is easy to get to from the airport and has close access to the Metro line, but it is a long way from downtown though.  We really enjoyed the rooms, they were clean, spacious and luxurious. Breakfast was great, and at a discount if you Pre pay at the front desk.  Our only complaint was the hand towel rack fell off and landed on my girlfriends foot, at first we weren't sure if it broke her foot or not, it was incredibly heavy.  We called front desk and they eventually sent ice and offered a doctor and visit to the hospital. We were flying home the next morning and after awhile she felt that it wasn't probably broken, just deeply bruised. The next morning, at checkout I brought the piece of metal to checkout with me and the manager apologized, and paid for our breakfast, I wasn't expecting a free stay but ‚Ç¨30 which ended up causing huge problems and the use of a wheelchair on the long trip home, was a little less than what should have been done, anyways, don't stand under the towel rack as you brush your teeth.",4,2012,09,07
30,My fav hotel in Barcelona,"Had a wonderful stay here, and I decided to upgrade to the Duplex rooms. Well it was well worth it! Room on 2 floors, with Jacuzzi, lounge, 2 tv's, sound system, panoramic view over barcelona, king sized bed, all the comforts you can think of. And the lounge was awesome as well, nice drinks, and atmosphere. Will definitely be back.",5,2012,09,07
30,Barcelona big hotel with good access to Metro,"We stayed here for 4 nights on a good deal with free Parking, Wifi and Breakfast which made the price very inviting. 
The hotel is quite new and is situated 300 meters from the end of the L1 metro line so only a couple of Euros and you are in the town center.
Good room, very good bed and maid service with very helpful staff. Excellent breakfast with everything you could possibly need. 
Don't be put off by the location it saves you dragging your case around the city (which you see a lot) and the extra cost of parking you car if you are driving.
They also have a shuttle but to and from the Airport so no excuse not to give them a try. 
Like me you will be impressed",4,2012,09,06
30,Beautiful hotel,"I think everything was outstanding. The service of the Bell Hop who greeted us at the car, the room, the elevators, the wisdom and service of the front desk who gave us sound advice, and even the shuttle driver to the airport. Listen, we were SUPER bummed that the restaurant upstairs was closed (was this because there was an August holiday in motion, or are they simply struggling financially?), but I thought this place was outstanding regardless.",5,2012,09,04
30,a bit half-baked and poorly located,"Oh I was ready to love this hotel.

My wife and I stayed here for one night on August 27th and we had originally booked a room well in advance via Expedia for about US$112.00 after all expenses.

The taxi ride up to this huge hotel with the unusual architecture was pretty dramatic.  Their reception area downstairs is likewise quite dramatic.

When we arrived we were offered the option to upgrade to one of their tower suite rooms for only 100Euro more (about US$125 at the time of this writing).  I figured, why not, let's give it a try.  That put the price up to about US$225/night.

The touchscreen elevator controls were a bit unusual at first, but kept with the futuristic theme of the place.  However, when we got in the elevator and walked down the 25th floor hallway... the air was stifling hot, stale and muggy.  It seems to save money (and probably because August is a slow month in Barcelona), they didn't air-condition the public areas other than perhaps the reception area downstairs.  Forgivable and enviro-friendly anyway, so I can overlook it.  I've never encountered that in a hotel before though.

When we got in the room, I was *definitely* impressed upon first walking in!  Beautiful livingroom area with dramatic dark stained woods, tasteful decor, dual light olive-colored loveseats, a floor-to-ceiling window looking towards downtown Barcelona, with a nice view of the beautiful red Porta Fira Towers building perhaps a mile down the road, and the cool glass and wood stairway leading to the upstairs bedroom.  I was ready to say, ""Definitely worth the extra 100euro!""

Climbing the stairs up to the bedroom revealed a nice jacuzzi tub underneath angled 45-degree windows that afforded the same nice views towards downtown, as well as some direct sunlight.  Unfortunately, the windows were fairly dirty and clearly hadn't been washed off in some time.  Otherwise, the upstairs was again quite lovely with very dark stained wood flooring and wall paneling, a separate marble (or perhaps travertine?) shower, etc.  A very nicely laid out suite.

Once we started getting settled in is when we realized some of the ""half-baked"" or otherwise poorly executed items that somewhat tainted our stay.

For one, the toilets do not rest on the floor but rather are suspended from the wall.  This would be very cool and keeping with the modern theme of the place.  However, when I sat on the toilet and felt it flex away from the wall-- the grout showing a clear crack where it was no longer attached-- it was a bit disconcerting to realize that only the plumbing pipes were holding up this toilet.

(Please pardon me in advance but) I didn't quite realize how much I appreciate being able to fully relax and take a decent crap.  I found I wasn't able to fully relax or really spend more than a minute or so on either of the toilets in this suite because I was worried they were going to break off the wall!  A really crappy design, if you'll pardon my pun... these toilets would not be missed if the Hesperia Tower hotel replaced them with standard units, or even just buttressed (another pun perhaps?) them underneath to prevent them from flexing away from the wall.

Another minor but somewhat revealing ""half-baked"" item was in the downstairs bathroom, where a rolled-up towel was provided next to the sink for drying your hands... but absolutely nowhere to hang the towel after one was done?!  A small towel rack or hook placed somewhere in the bathroom would be an easy fix... but, surprisingly, none available.  So the bath towel was just crumpled up and put next to the sink.

The stairs leading up to the bedroom had some minor trim pieces that were a bit loose and added a bit to the ""half-baked"" (or under maintained, or poorly funded/losing money?) theme of this hotel.

My wife is a bit of a bubble bath connoisseur and she very much enjoyed taking two separate baths in this tub, despite the dust-covered window view of the downtown lights.  I found the shower to again be modern, probably a bit expensive... and pleasant enough.

However, when I put on the provided bath robes... yikes!  ouch!  These had to have been the single most abrasive pieces of fabric I've ever put on.  Seriously.  I've cleaned my shower grout with less abrasive material.  My skin honestly crawls at the recollection of briefly donning one of these robes.  Even seeing them in the pictures makes me uncomfortable.  Did they really need to cut corners and save money so much that they eliminated fabric softener for their robes?  I understand the economy is doing poorly, and perhaps this more upscale hotel is going through a rough patch... but they almost literally passed on their rough patch to their hotel guests in the metaphorical form of these abrasive bath robes!

Also, I should note that even though water glasses are provided, and that Barcelona is a big modern city, do not make the mistake of even tasting the Barcelona water from the tap.  Just... don't do it.  Not a fault of this hotel of course, but just wanted to give fellow travelers a heads-up.  I imagine only Manila or Mexico City could have worse tap water.  (If you're staying in Barcelona for an extended period, do yourselves a favor and buy a large jug of bottled water from any small grocery store downtown.)

All that said, I do feel I should highlight that the service i received was quite good and as expected for such a nice hotel.  In fact, they knew my wife and I were on our honeymoon so they sent up some Codorniu bubbly wine, strawberries and chocolate sauce on-the-house.  Quite tasty and a nice touch.

We got hungry and ordered some room service for their pizza margherita and a necessary 750cl bottle of Evian water.  These were rather pricey, but the pizza was good and of course the water was drinkable.  That bottle though cost me an almost jaw dropping 7euros... and all this was before they added in the room service delivery fee and automatically included tip.

Lastly, we opted to catch the metro to Las Ramblas and found just how out-of-the-way this hotel is located.  It was about a 5 minute walk to the metro station, which was the last stop at the end of the line, and it took perhaps 30 minutes on the train before we were finally able to disembark at Las Ramblas.

All told, though the hotel staff were quite good, very professional and helpful... I cannot say that I'd stay in this hotel again.  The location is too far from Las Ramblas, and the hotel standards are not being kept up to par to meet the higher demands that the clientele of this hotel would seem to cater to.  Not that there are any glaring issues... but the hotel management cannot cut corners so much that guests are actually physically uncomfortable when putting on a robe, or windows go unwashed, minor trim pieces in room stairs are not maintained, etc.  Not for US$225+ a night.",2,2012,09,03
30,Great place to stay!!,"I just got back from Hesperia Tower Barcelona last friday, and wish I was back! The hotel staff were great, very helpful and friendly. We had a room on the 20th floor with a great view, we slept with the curtains open one night just because I loved seeing the lights of the city.  Didn't get to try the evo restaurant as it was closed, but had lots of good food elsewhere so wasnt a prob.  If you are going to have breakfast book it the night before as it works out to be about ¬£10 cheaper per person. We got the shuttle bus into the city centre one day, as we had asked reception what time it was leaving, get there 20mins before its scheduled to leave as it is only a small little minibus and it left as soon as it was full up. There is a supermarket behind the hotel, so get your drinks from there as its so cheap (only 8 euros for a big bottle of bacardi!), and then get your ice bucket from your room filled up at the bar in the lobby.  If you ask for ice from room service they charge you 5 euros. It is true what all the other reviews say, it is not right in the heart of everything, but my boyfriend and I were happy getting taxis everywhere, it only cost us 13-15 euros to get us to olympic marina where all the nice bars, restaurants and beaches were.  I couldn't tell you about the metro as my bf decided to be a diva and didn't ever want to get on the metro as it was so hot!.  I would recommend a trip to the zoo, it was great and defo see the dolphin show which is included in the price of you zoo entry ticket.   All in all I had a lovely stay at this hotel and if i was going back to barcelona I would have no hesitation in booking a room there.",4,2012,08,27
30,lovely hotel,"i stayed here two years ago, we got  very good deal through last minute.com, and this was a top secret hotel so we were not told the name until we booked through
the hotel does have a michelin star restaurant but unfortunately it was closed for most of august and we had not booked for the last few days of july we were staying
hoever, the other restuarant which we had breakfast in was very nice and we were spoilt for choice as to what to have
the rooms were very stylish, including the bathroom which was one of the best parts - the radio/ tv could be played in there so you could catch up on the news whilst in the shower
the down side was that the pool/gym was not open to under 18's so my daughter could not use it which we were not told when we booked
it is quite far from the centre but by the metro it is only a few stops away to the centre and las ramblas and the beach 
the recpionist was very helpful; she gave us a map and told us some must sees to visit whilst in Barcelona
one of these was plaza de espana, where they have a light and water show at the fountain & we also managed to get tickets to the european championships being held nearby in 2010!
the bar was also very stylish, and the barman very helpful and happy to explain the contents of cocktails and make virgin ones for my daughter
over all we were very pleased with this hotel",5,2012,08,25
30,Comfortable and modern,"Very modern and fashionable designed This hotel close to the airport is reasonably priced 109 euro per room ,all the amnesties: the heavy big towels the modern shower the room size is ok -too much consideration for design but, a simple table to put the suitcase is missing or has no space so you realize customers are putting the luggage on the office table and scratch it So manny mirrors you get confused The bed is large and comfortable so all in all you are getting more than expected and you can well relax ¬†but.... If you are just using it for overnight you have to take into consideration 50 euro for tax,i to and from the hotel ¬†(there is no hotel shuttle ¬†available regularly )and 40 euro for breakfast you come out at 200 euro .....",4,2012,08,24
30,Super nice hotel!,"I got a very affordable price, and had to book a weekend for me and a friend. We weren't dissapointed!

Very calm and beautiful lobby, very stylish rooms with a smart layout and very modern equipment.

A bit of a downside was the price for the breakfast (‚Ç¨20) that could have been included. But very friendly staff, both in the lobby and up in the restaurants.

3 minute walk to the metro that took us in to the central parts of down in about 20 minutes (a day pass for ‚Ç¨6.95 was very price worthy), and a 10 minute taxi ride to, and from, the airport for around ‚Ç¨16-17.

I would recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2012,08,22
30,A pleasant stay in Barcelona!,"We stayed in this hotel for a week in August 2012. This hotel is situated quite far out of the centre of Barcelona, however has excellent transport links to the city. The Hospital de Bellvitge metro station is 2 minutes walk away and has regular trains (when they work, or don‚Äôt randomly change direction in the middle of travelling!) to the centre of Barcelona. It cost us about 30 Euros for a 5 day travel card. 

The hotel has an impressive lobby and check in was quick and easy. Our room was a good size and came with  twin beds, flat screen TV on which we could get BBC1, automatic curtains, lots of plug sockets, minibar, hair dryer and a few free toiletries. The bathroom was also an excellent size and the shower was superb, though did leak quite a bit onto the floor. As the weather was very hot and sunny the air conditioning was also great, though it did break down mid-week but was sorted by the hotel by the time we returned to our room in the evening. 

The view from our hotel room was great, we were looking across to the airport, but the other side of the hotel looks towards the city. There was very little traffic noise through the windows which was good for sleeping well. 

Breakfast at the hotel is very expensive, so we brought some essentials from the local superstore which is about 5 minutes walk away. There isn‚Äôt much else in the area to explore though. 

While we were staying there, the elevators did break down. They were fixed within a day, and the hotel was allowing people to use the staff / service lifts. At first we didn‚Äôt realise this as the maid on our corridor directed us to walk down 16 flights of fire escape stairs!

Overall this is an excellent hotel for tourists visiting Barcelona as long as you are prepared to use the metro at the start and end of each day. It cost us 20 Euros to get a taxi from the airport to the hotel as this was the minimum charge. Returning to the airport cost us 17.50 Euros.",4,2012,08,18
30,terrible customer service,"when we checked in, they assigned us a room and told us we had a great city view. we went to the room as instructed. the keys did not work. since this happens with electronic keys from time to time, we figured it was no big deal, and went back down to get new keys. the person behind the reception desk instead told me i must be doing it wrong and gave me a lecture about how to do it correctly in front of everyone. i insisted that i knew how to do it correctly, and that she re-do the keys. she did that. i took the keys up to the room again, and it still didn't work. i went down again, and she re-did them again. i went back up, and this time it worked--i managed to open the door, ONLY TO FIND THAT THE ROOM WAS ALREADY OCCUPIED!!!! I apologized to the room occupant, and went back down again to the same person. this time she gave me keys to a different room, and, oddly enough, started giving me another lecture and reading the room number very loudly, AS IF SOMEHOW THIS HAD BEEN MY FAULT AND I HAD READ THE ROOM NUMBER INCORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME!!. finally we got into an unoccupied room, which of course was not the city view room we had been promised. we received no consideration for this ridiculous service except for a second helping of three tiny chocolates. any competent hotel would have not had this happen in the first place, or at least comped dinner or something. finally, i asked the bartender where the place to print out boarding passes was. he told me to go around the front desk and continue past it. i did that, only to find that i had entered a private office, where a panicky hotel employee asked me what i was doing there. when i explained what i was looking for he sent me to the right place, which was in the exact opposite direction of where i had previously been sent. 

the folks in this place don't have the slightest idea what they're doing. ",1,2012,08,18
30,A bit too far out of town - felt like commuting to the holiday on the Metro!,"I stayed at the Hisperia for a week in August with a friend after getting a last minute deal. My first impression was a vary chic hotel but definitely not a 5* in the traditional sense. We stayed in a standard room which was extremely comfortable, it was pretty much silent, good air conditioning with extremely comfortable beds - I slept a lot better here than at home! 
It was the small things that brought the rating down like the TV being temporamental, the shower being a little loose, etc. Overall though the standard of accommodation was very good. Elsewhere the food seemed overpriced - breakfast was 15 Euros if pre-booked the night before or 20 Euros on the day. Room service was  extortionate, but I understand that value for money means different things to different people. The complimentary shuttle bus was also pretty much useless - we needed to depart at midday on our last day, the shuttle left at 0900 or 1800 - pointless. On a different note though the transport links were very good - the metro is 5 mins away with a 30 minute ride into town and the bus stop is simililarily close by. Night buses run through the night so you can always get back. The biggest problem I found was that with going into town in the day and then coming back to get showered and changed to go out again we were the doing the return journey twice a day, totaling up about 2 hours on travelling. I think this would be okay for a couple of days but for a week was too much. 
OVERALL I can't fault the hotel too much, you get what you pay for but it's a 4* not a 5. When I return to Barcelona, which I most definitely will, I will be looking for somewhere closer to town that can cut down my commuting time!",3,2012,08,18
30,Barcelona Trip,"Hesperia Tower is situated just outside the centre of Barcelona but close to the metro, so it's easy to get around Barcelona. I was travelling with two children, and had a junior suite. It was adequate in size with nice bathrooms. We had access to the executive lounge where we could relax and have breakfast.
There's a choice of 3 restaurants to eat and if you want to treat yourself go to Evo, the spherical Michelin starred restaurant at the top of the building. Great view, great environment, great service and wow what food. . . the best in Barcelona!",4,2012,08,16
30,Excellent hotel,"Following  cruise, spent two nights here.  Found hotel excellent in all departments. Standard room very acceptable with queen bed and outstanding bathroom facilities etc.  Great value for money.  On outskirts of city. Metro 20 mins to city centre. At first glance the housing estate behind the hotel looks bleak, but we found all locals very friendly and helpful although no-one spoke any English.  If you don't want a big hotel breakfast (20 euros ) you can get a good selection of croissants, pastries, coffee etc at a little bakery in the precinct (365. Com) for 3 or 4 euros.  We arrived late and couldn't be bothered to go into city so found a local tapas bar ( a little further into estate) and some great tapas at really low prices. I think it was called the New world cafe. Loved Barcelona and will return again soon.",5,2012,08,15
30,excellent hotel,"Great hotel for short trips. I stayed with his wife one day. It is convenient to travel by bus from the airport and the city center - on the subway, next to the station. Attentive staff and a varied and rich breakfast. Our DBL room was on the 17th floor and the impressive panorama of the city viewed. Great dignity - free Wi-Fi in the hotel, as well as in the room.",4,2012,08,14
30,Stunning Views,"Booked twin room with HOTELS.COM-Outstanding value for 3 night stay-Everything was in place as a 5* hotel should be-Only gripe was courtesy Bus to Gava Beach being late and full, but this was resolved quickly by excellent Duty Manager-Sandra.At end of metro line A only 20 minutes to Catalunya Hub.
Metro ticket is only 10 euros for multi trips we stayed on 18th floor and the views were great,
if anyone wanted to visit Costas whilst they are in Barcelona then get metro to line L1(RED) to Placa de Sants, change to L5 (blue) get off at Sants Estacio Hub-Then get RENFE Ticket from automatic machine on forecourt only 8.60 euros return.The train that you will be catching is the C1 - destination Blanes. The journey lasts approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes,Platform 8 every 30 minutes service you can get off at Callela-Pineda De Mar-Santa Sussana.",4,2012,08,13
30,Great hotel in quiet location,"We stayed at the end of July for a week. We had two rooms booked on the 10th floor. When i walked into the room was suprised as you walk into a massive bathroom! then you opened a door and the room was there - was unusual and a bit annoying if staying with family and want some privacy! View was great, the beds had wheels so everytime we sat up they kept sliding, which was annoying. Shuttle bus was good to take to town but didn't come back so had to get metro which is 20 minutes away and the stop was across the road from the hotel. The swimming pool was next door which is 12 Euros to use and you should have flip flops and swimming hat if you don't you need to pay extra for these! Which was not stated on the website. Also we chose this hotel because of the resturant on the top floor but when we arrived we were told by the receptionist that it had been closed down! so was not very happy! the breakfast was excellent though. Personally i would only stay if i was on business as it's near the airport but not with family. ",3,2012,08,11
30,"Great hotel, poor location, unrealistic pricing","I booked this hotel with lastminute.com for an unbelievable price of ¬£50 per night. On arrival I was offered to upgrade to a suite for ‚Ç¨50 a night, which we did. The benefits of the suite between the two of us made up the additional cost. The swimming pool is ‚Ç¨24 per person, per entry but free with the suite upgrade. Business lounge access with free drinks and breakfast made the rest of it up too.
We didn't hang around much to see what service was on offer but anyone we encountered was pleasant and smiled.
The room we got was amazing, jacuzzi bath, lots of luxurious fabrics etc, all to be expected from this class of hotel. We ordered some extra pillows at 10PM, they arrived at 1AM - they had to call the phone to wake us up to deliver them, more inconvenient that not having them; why not leave them in the top of the wardrobe?
I was impressed with the hotel but the cost of using the pool if not included was exorbitant and a brief check of the menus (drinks/food) was definitely in line with the Intercontinental Park Lane, without the location or client base.
The location most of all lets it down, close to the airport with no noise, but too far from the city. The metro stop at the hotel is useless as its 40 minutes to the city and you're at the mercy of the public transport to get home, taxi's are hardly Barcelona's most cost effective mode of transport.
I would recommend it and stay again, but beware it does have pitfalls.",4,2012,08,10
30,"Impressive, but don't rely on the shuttle","Very cool hotel with impressive and stylish rooms. Free WiFi was appreciated. The best part was the incredible view from the room!
Our disappointment was that we chose the hotel precisely because of its shuttles to the airport and to Plaza Catalunya. Unfortunately, the shuttle is not as useful as we'd hoped. Firstly, it comes VERY rarely (e.g. there are trips to the airport before 9am and then not until 18:40!). Secondly, it goes both ways to the airport (though coming from the airport you'd have to call in advance), but only one way to Plaza Catalunya. Thankfully, the L1 metro has a stop very close to the hotel (Hospital de Bellvitge) so it may be far but it's still quite accessible.
But other than the shuttle, everything else was really impressive!",4,2012,08,02
30,Amazing suites,"This was our second stay at Hesperia Tower, having first been here in 2009 on another Travelzoo deal.  We loved it so much we had to return.  The building and the rooms are truly amazing.  This time we had a duplex suite (an upgrade we didn't pay for) with a great view of the city.  On the ""ground"" floor of the suite, there was a big living room and a small bathroom, then a glass-railed staircase led up to the bedroom and a further bathroom.  There was a jacuzzi placed by the window in the bedroom, underneath a sloping glass window to look out at the city.  It was such an amazing room.  Nice Bvlgari products too.  Staying in a suite also grants you access to the Tower Club where you can relax on sofas and help yourself to tea, coffee, drinks and snacks all day and until 11pm.  You can choose from nice cava, wine, beer, soft drinks and a huge array of spirits and liqeurs.  There were never more than a couple of people there at the same time as us.

This being our second visit, I guess we noticed some little flaws on this occasion.  The rooms are amazing & hard to beat, but there is a limited choice in the hotel in terms of food, and it lacks a bar with atmosphere.  During this visit, the only place open for food was the lobby bar.  Having said that, taxis are cheap and plentiful to visit the city at night.  And during the day, the metro and hotel shuttle are very convenient.  

Despite these flaws, we loved this hotel.  Yes, it would be better if you didn't have to get any transport from your hotel in Barcelona and could wander between sights on foot.  However, if you want a luxurious hotel at a very reasonable price and are willing to compromise on location, this hotel can be amazing value for money.  Both times we stayed here in suites for around ‚Ç¨100 per night, and that price included breakfast, as well as access to both the Tower Club, and the leisure area & spa.  Hotel suites of a similar standard in the centre would be considerably more expensive, not a price we'd ever pay. To us, it's not much of a compromise and that's why we like it so much, but a lot of people may disagree.",5,2012,07,31
30,DID NOT LIVE UP TO ITS REPUTATION!,"My girlfriend and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the hesperia hotel and as an architect i can safely say that the building outshines the service. 
On arrival I was informed that the ""big double bed room"" that i had paid extra for was unavailable and i would have to make do with two single beds pulled together! My reservation clearly stated a big double bed and yet the staff were reluctant to provide this and instead insultingly tried to degrade my reservation. After speaking with the manager this issue was resolved, if only the check-in staff were as helpful. 
Other unpleasantries included:
We did not recieve any fresh towels or bedding throughout our stay, 
When checking in we over heard the couple next to us get offered the chance to upgrade for a special price, however this was not offered to us for some reason (despite them booking the same room),
check-in and check-out times were not given when making our reservation, nor were they illustrated on thier website which meant we had to contact the hotel before we arrived to seek this information, 

On the plus side my girlfriend was given a very nice cake for her birthday, the architecture and interior design is world class and represents some of richard rogers best work. If you manage to get a city view it is one that will pull you to the window, if like us you get a south facing view you get to look at thousands of containers and the airport. 

would of been nice if the",4,2012,07,30
30,Post cruise stay,Needed to stay an extra day in Barcelona near the airport.  Used Travelocity to find this one and couldn't have been happier.  The room was excellent and very modern.  There is metro station nearby which made it possible to go into the city   The room was clean and quiet with all the bells and whistles.  They do have a limited shuttle service to the airport but we used a taxi which wasn't expensive .  We didn't use the restaurant since we went into the city.  I would stay there again.,5,2012,07,29
30,Fully Meets Expectations,"Stayed for three nights in July and was pleasantly surprised. Rooms are big and nicely decorated (as is whole hotel in general). Breakfast is excellent and service is outstanding, plus if you consider that for all of this you pay under USD 100 there is no reason to be unhappy. 
Only thing to complain is price for hotel parking - EURO 24 per night. This is just unfair price considering the fact that in downtown Barcelona you can park anywhere for night max EURO 18.  Plus, there are lots of free parking places around the hotel always available. So, tip will be - instead of paying unfair price 24 euros, just park next to hotel where there is always free place.",4,2012,07,27
30,"Amazing stay, excellent hotel","We had a wonderful 6 nights in Hesperia Tower. The rooms are comfortable, big and perfectly clean. Stayed on the 23rd floor and the room had great views. Staff members are friendly and helpful. It's a bit far from the centre of Barcelona, but the metro station is right there and the journey is only 15-20 minutes. Also, the hotel has is own suttle bus to the centre or the airport. We would recommend this hotel for anybody.",5,2012,07,26
30,As expected,"Efficiant and professional; gym is not in the same building so get ready to walk 200 m on the street, and hope is not raining; quite pricey (10 euros for a coffee and juice) but room was fine (2303 on 23rd floor). Convenient as is 5 minutes from T1 and 10 minutes from Plaza Catalunya!",4,2012,07,23
30,Business trip.,"Stayed here for my second work trip, this time took the upgrade offered for 30 euros. This included continental breakfast, afternoon and evening drinks, lovely cava and nice little nibbles. We did have access to the spa but did not have time.  The location for me is great as long as you do not get stuck in early or late traffic.  Location to airport is great and only about 12 Euros.  The rooms are of a good quality, though i did have a minor problem with a leak from the room above into my bathroom.  I was moved but had to move myself and carry all my stuff. I would stay again if i can get a good deal but would not pay the full price.",4,2012,07,19
30,DELUXE DUPLEX SUITE WAS FANTASTIC! TOTALLY 5+STARS!,"We stayed at Hesperia for one night at the end of our cruise. Previously, we had stayed at another five star hotel ME by Melia but there is no comparison. Hesperia is better in every way. It is not in the center of the city, but is a short walk to the train and there are also free shuttles to La Ramblas area, the airport, and beach that run on a certain schedule. We did not get to try the famous dome restaurant at the top because it was fully booked for the week. We stayed in the ultimate luxury deluxe duplex two level suite that was absolutely fantastic in every way. The room was a nice, cool, comfortable temperature. First floor had a half bath with sink, closet, flat screen tv entertainment center, two chaise lounges with coffee table, another table further back with several chairs to do work or eat at. There were floor to ceiling windows on the first floor. You go up a flight of stairs to the second floor where there is a very nice king sized bed that was very comfortable with extra pillows provided. There was a nice tall burgundy velour type headboard with wood accents. The floors were wood. The entire place was spotlessly clean. There is a second bathroom upstairs with separate toilet. There is a sink that included many extra amenities kit along with Bvulgari body lotion, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. The shower had a tower with many options, like a rainfall from the top, a handheld option and six jets that can squirt out at you in different angles. Shower is big enough for two people to share. Also, there is a beautiful jacuzzi tub big enough for two in the bedroom next to the windows with electronic shades that can be adjusted as you like. It was very romantic taking a dip in the jacuzzi with the lights at night overlooking the city. We had a great view of the airport and could see planes landing and taking off but didn't hear any airplane noise. It is expensive but highly recommend this deluxe duplex suite for those who seek nothing less than five star luxury. We ordered room service twice. The food was okay. The front desk staff was extremely helpful, friendly and responsive to all of our questions. Having the deluxe suite also gives you access to the spa/pool/gym area which we took a look at but did not use. I would highly recommend this to any couple for a romantic getaway but the suite is so lovely you will want to stay there and not leave! Very happy stay and will definitely stay here again when we visit Barcelona next time. LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!",5,2012,07,17
30,A Great Hotel halfway between the city and the airport.,"I visited this hotel with my wife and my in-laws over5 the weekend of 13th-15th July 2012 as part of our 5th Wedding Anniversary celebrations and found the hotel to Very Good Indeed.

Having visited the City of Barcelona many many times in the past, I had ignored the moans and groans of reviewers on here who had been disappointed with the hotels location in proximity to the city/Las Ramblas, as I knew exactly where Hesperia Tower was.

I had booked two Suites for our stay, both located on the 24th floor, offering fantastic views (particularly at night) of Barcelona.  The suites were spacious, clean, modern and comfortable and afforded us a small amount of luxury with fantastic Value For Money.  In fact, I honestly couldnt find anything above 2stars close to Las Ramblas for the same price!!

The hotel also offers a spa and Health Centre, two restaurants (the one on the roof has been awarded a Michelin star), but i cannot comment on any of those features as we didnt use them.  There is also a bar located behind reception.  I used this on both days and found the service to be excellent and also good value for a hotel of this standard! (may I also recommend the Irish coffee as a nightcap...... WOW!).

If you are looking for stay in Barcelona, where you want to be in and out of your hotel all day then Hesperia Tower isnt for you and you should book something close to or around las Ramblas.  If however, you, like us, are up early ready to go out for the day, return early evening for R&R before returning out later for dinner etc, then honestly you wont go wrong.

The nearest Metro station is Hospital De Bellvitge across the road from the hotel an approx. 4 minute walk where you can get on Line 1 and go straight to Placa Catalunya in 25mins....or if you want to come out straight on Las Ramblas outside Boqueira Market you can get Line 1 to Espanya before changing to Line 3 and heading to Liceu. (30mins).

A taxi ride will cost you anywhere between 15-18Euros..

All in All, a fantastic hotel, situated halfway between the city and the airport, that offered great value for money for what we paid and a location that will have you in the city in 25-30mins by Metro or 15mins by cab.",4,2012,07,16
30,Peaceful airport stay,"For close proximity to the airport, we stayed at the Hesperia Towers at the beginning and end of our trip.  The staff is attentive and accommodating and rooms are quiet and well appointed.  Breakfast buffet is extensive, with selections to please a variety of food preferences.",4,2012,07,15
30,Spanish vacation,"If you're looking for a hotel in Barcelona, then look no further, the Hesperia Towers Hotel was absolutely wonderful, clean, comfortable and very, very convenient to the metro.  A little further from the center, but they have a free shuttle to the center every day.  The breakfast was nothing short of first-class for 10 Eurs each per daynd what a bargain.
Will definately stay there again.

30,Excellent all rounder!,"Fantastic hotel!
Away from the bustle of the city -which is a godsend.Travelling was simple -5 minutes on foot to the metro and app 25mins to centre of Barcelona.Quick, easy and painless.
The reception staff were efficient,helpful and friendly,they were always happy to answer any questions and their knowledge of Barcelona was extremely good.All the other staff were conscientious, always busy but very courteous too.The manager of this hotel runs a tight ship and it shows.
The hotel itself is what you would expect from a five star -pristine,scrupulously clean, with up to date technology,ammenities and gadgets.The hotel atrium is oppulent ,bright and airy, a theme which carries on to the bedrooms.The bedrooms are fantastic, well laid out, equipped, very spacious complete with an extra large comfortable firm bed (brilliant!).
The view from 10th floor was amazing too.
Local vicinity- residential area,clean and quiet surroundings.

Would not hesitate coming here again and would highly recommend this to all.
Praise were it is due- hotel management and all the staff deserve credit for this excellent all rounder. All their endeavours made my trip a brilliant and memorable one.
Thank you.",5,2012,07,13
30,So nice to come home to,"The 6 year old hotel is midway between Barcelona Airport & Placa Catalunya (City Centre). You can see the tower rising from the flat landscape as you land at the airport. Regulated taxi is ‚Ç¨20.00 to the hotel (2 people + 2 pieces of luggage) Several times in the morning & late afternoon there is a courtesy coach from the hotel to Catalunya Plaza. There are also several courtesy coach departures to the airport each day. The Metro is a five minute walk from the hotel, and it is worthwhile buying a 10 ride met card for ‚Ç¨9.50 from the easy to use metro station vending machine. The ride to Catalunya Plaza is 20 mins. Trains run every 4 minutes!
Our room on the 9th floor had views towards the airport, the alternate is city views - neither spectacular. Our room was of a high 4 star standard, beautifully appointed and very clean and comfortable. The hotel itself is  ""state of the art"" including the lifts. Breakfast is only included for the ""Executive"" suites, otherwise it is ‚Ç¨16.50 per head - but a magnificent selection. We stayed here for a week, but for shorter stays, I would choose a hotel closer to the city centre.
The staff are exceptionally friendly - and nothing is too much trouble.
Highly recommended.",5,2012,07,11
30,Forget all the negative reviews!,"A true (Spanish) 5 star hotel close to the airport and Metro station across the street.
(US 5 star would be the ""W"" at the water!) We had the standard room 1007 on the 10th floor with views to the mountains and airport. The even number rooms show the city. Spacious room with all the 5 star ameneties. excellent service at the reception (up to 4 receptionists). Great for a convention. State of the art (4) elevators with ""I-Pad type call unit"" a kid can figure this one out.
Your wife will ask your for a remodel of the bathroom after you stay at this hotel. If you have the funds get the upgrade with the SPA (18 and older but 16 was o.k. for our visit).
they just don't want screaming kids in the spa (open to the public!). We tried to eat at EVO
(Euro 85 and up) but there was a mix up with the request for a vegetarian meal for my daughter
and it didn't happen on our last night. maybe next time. MeuterMedia",5,2012,07,10
30,Nice hotel away from the city centre,"I booked this hotel with the lastminute.com secret hotel promotion so I was not aware of the hotel or location prior to confirming the booking. However, I ended up being pleased with this choice. Hesperia Tower is about 20 minutes by train away from Plaza Catalunya - which is where you will find La Ramblas - a must-visit area for any tourist to Barcelona. The train station is just across the street from the hotel and the train network is easy to understand so I had no issues at all with the location.

This hotel is mainly a business hotel. However, I travelled with my spouse for leisure purposes and it suited our needs perfectly. The rooms are nice and comfortable. The staff were friendly and were able to communicate to us in English.

The only issue I had with Hesperia Tower is that they never responded to an email I sent them a few days before we arrived asking for the schedule for the coach that collects passengers from the airport. On arrival, we made our way to the pick up point and were advised by the coaches for the other hotels that the Hesperia Tower airport transport service is ""so-so"". After waiting for about 15 minutes we called the hotel and were told that the next time the coach would be at the airport was another two hours. They told us we can also take a bus from the airport so we did that (the fare was 2 euro per person) and the bus ride was about 15 minutes. We had a good bus driver and he made sure we got off at the right stop. the hotel was just across the street.

Overall we had a comfortable stay and I would recommend this hotel to others.",4,2012,07,09
30,"Very good quality, but slightly distant from city centre","The hotel itself, and its staff, were of a very good standard.  The room was very clean, modern and welcoming in every respect.  The only issue we had revolved around the hotel's location, which is about 15 minutes from Barcelona city centre on a weekend -- and I would imagine travel time would increase during weekdays.",4,2012,07,07
30,Wonderful!,"Quite simply an excellent hotel. The room I stayed in was large, nicely decorated and most importantly, clean! There was a flat screen television in the room with an excellent choice of both local and international channels. Wired and Wi-Fi internet was included for the duration of my stay at no extra cost. Furthermore, the mini bar was stocked with the usual suspects. However, a visit to the very local petrol station provided a far cheaper alternative for snacks and drinks. 

The quality and selection of the food made available was truly 5 star. Please choose to pay that little extra for the buffet breakfast when booking this hotel because you will not be disappointed!  
The choice was fantastic. Continental breakfast or a full English. Different types of fresh juices, yogurts, cereals and fruits. They had everything and more.

I must also mention the quality of the food available during the night. I chose to have a late dinner in my room one night and had the beef burger with cheese and fries on the menu. The beef burger was the best burger I had ever experienced bar none!

The location of the hotel isn't great and neither were the views from the room however, Hospital de Bellvitge metro station is literally a two minutes walk from the hotel and there is a free shuttle bus that runs from the hotel to the city centre at certain times on a daily basis. The bus takes approximately, 10 - 15 mins (depending on traffic) to reach the city centre. There is a separate free shuttle bus that runs from the hotel to the airport at various times as well.

The staff were very helpful and knowledgeable and provided me with all relevant city centre and metro maps on arrival and a list of departure times for the buses mentioned above. 

Overall, a wonderful hotel that I highly recommend.",5,2012,07,04
30,Real 5 star property,"This is one of the best hotel I have visited in spain. The grand lobby and large size room.
view from both the side of hotel is excellent. Morning break fast is very good. the only surprise I got is the swimming pool charges are extra.It is located between airport and city.  Take the higher floor so you can have the view of almost entire city. The roof top reasurant is very good.",5,2012,07,02
30,Not exactly 5 star,"We stayed here for 2 nights and the hotel itself was fine. I agree with the other reviews that the food was great, but there are a couple of things to be aware of... The location is not near the city centre, but to make up for it, there is a free bus for 16 people which runs every so often. If you are unlucky enough not to be in the first 16, then you will either have to wait 40 mins or find the metro and take it from there.
The pool is next to the hotel and is not included in the price, so only bring swim gear for the beach or pay 12 Euro and head across...
I have certainly experienced much better from 5 star hotels.",2,2012,06,30
30,Simply the Best,"Hesperia Tower is a high end, 5 star luxury hotel, an amazing piece of modern architecture (think Anish Kapoor) with an amazing restaurant and friendly helpful staff.  It‚Äôs one of the best Spanish hotels I have stayed in and the price makes it quite possibly the best value for money hotel in Barcelona.

The rooms are a really nice size, have everything you could think of, huge bathrooms and are eccentric enough to make you realise you‚Äôre not in some other 5 star chain hotel.  Only thing lacking is tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms.

My family and I dined at the hotel each and every night of our 3 night stay as the food was just amazing, and though not cheap, value for money was excellent.  Wine is expensive so make sure the bottle lasts the meal and then enjoy a drink somewhere else in the hotel.  Breakfast was also a fortune (¬£25) but also amazing.

One negative is the location, its 20/30 mins outside the centre and not in a particularly nice area, with no real views.  However, there is a regular shuttle bus into the centre and they also take you to the airport.  All though the times are fixed the hotel will do what they can to accommodate you.  This is the only reason I've not given this a 5 star review as I don't think the website makes it clear just how far from the centre you are.

If I was in Barcelona again, I would stay here and if you do not mind being outside the centre, I‚Äôd 100% recommend you also stay here.",4,2012,06,29
30,Wonderful stay!,"I stayed in Hesperia Tower Barcelona for 4 nights in June, 2012 to attend my company's half yearly conference and all I can say is that it was one of the best hotels I stayed at in the last few years, outstanding and very professional customer service, very friendly staff, free shuttle to the airport, large room, excellent sleeping quality, room temperature was ideal and the AC was excellent and not noisy at all, free wifi although a bit weak signal in rooms, good food, and a great shower room! It was absolutely ideal for a business stay and I believe that one of the most important reasons of the success of the conference was the hotel itself. However, the moquette in my room was a little bit tired with some spots on it and the shower leaked a bit but I believe that's not a big deal at all and these were very minor things and many travellers won't even notice that.

The airport is very close to the hotel (about 10 minutes in the car). This hotel is ideal for a business stay and it's about 20 to 25 minutes away from Pla√ßa Catalunya using the metro. If you don't mind spending that time in the metro to reach the center then this hotel could be great for leisure travelers. 

I had a great stay there but I believe that what really made a big difference is the hotel staff and their professionalis and friendliness, it's obvious that they are very well trained to deal with business travellers and I was very satisfied with their quality of service. ",5,2012,06,28
30,A nice one!,"Overall great hotel. Rooms are very comfortable and most of all very unusal. When you enter the room, you step in to the big bathroom :) If you are higher up (was staying on 13th floor) you have a great view. Cleaning was great and staff is very kind and helpful. Breakfast is amazing and you can make your own nespresso coffee :) Swimming pool and SPA area is actually not a part of the hotel, so you have to pay entrance (think it was 15 eur.) One negative thing is that it is very very cold in the hotel, so I was there for a business trip in June and took with me summer clothes...therefore during our presentations in atrium and other offices in the hotel, I was freezing!
Taxi to the center costs approximately 15 eur and to the airport 24 eur (actually it is 12-13 but minimum price to airport is 24 so....)

Have a great stay!",4,2012,06,23
30,fantastic hotel,"just returned from this hotel.the hotel is well maintaind loverly decor,the standard rooms are of a good size we had one for 2 nights before are cruise on 10 june 2012 but surprised no tea making facilites breakfast dear at 24 euros each. after our cruise we stayed a further night sun 17 june,this time in the duplex suite fantastic as it allows you acess to the tower club.which when we stayed was open from 8am till 1030pm free drinks and snacks great?.so dont bother with breakfast just go into tower club as you can get cerals toast tea etc.the drink prices in hotel are dear ,go out main door turn right ,right again round back of hotel a little street in front of you there you will find a supermarket,a couple of bars,drinks cheap?,and 365 cafe excellent snacks etc at cheap prices overall a fantastic stay ENJOY",4,2012,06,20
30,Terrific Hotel and Staff,"We stayed at the Hesperia Tower Hotel on 6/1/12 and 6/2/12 before our cruise and again on 6/10/12. The staff was very helpful, friendly and professional.  Only 10 minutes from the airport and another 10 to 15 minutes by shuttle or taxi to Las Ramblas.  The hotel is very modern and clean.  The gym, pool and spa facility is amazing!  We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet.  After reading so many stories about pickpockets and purse snatchings, we decided on a tour guide to explore the city.  We booked two tours with ""Spanish Trails"" after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. I highly recommend this tour company especially if you have never visited Barcelona.  We had a wonderful experience and truly enjoyed the city. 
We hope to return to Barcelona again and stay at the Hesperia Tower.  Thank you to the staff especially those at the front desk, Roberto, who helped us with all our luggage and the sweet, adorable lady who drives the shuttle!  Best Wishes to all!",5,2012,06,18
30,Nice hotel with nice staff!,"We were warmly checked in by Tanya Pereira in the early morning hours of June 11/12. She was very professional and hospitable. The lobby of the hotel is large, clean and bright. The room is more than adequately furnished and lots of mirror. There is a free shuttle to the airport (starts at 7 a.m.) and Plaza Catalunya (starts at 10:20 a.m.)  It is quite convenient and close to the airport. Although check in is at 2 p.m., they will check you in if the room is available. Thank you Tanya!",4,2012,06,14
30,Posh and Tatty,"Stayed four nights in deluxe room which had a great view ,air con was working but was either to cold or to hot even after adjustment,electric socket behind the glass bedroom door was coming away from the wall,deep scratches on wood surround around door area,food stains on sofa,water leaked from shower into toilet area and dangerous step out shower onto tiles which had no slip mat which I nearly slipped over. 
Breakfast was 25 Euro each !which we declined on and used bar and supermarket behind the big electric retail shop( on right of the hotel as come out)/ between big apartment blocks.
Metro unlimited travel including buses/tram 24 Euro each for four days which was five minute walk.
We could have complained but we just wanted to see Barcelona.
5 star prices for a 3 star room.",3,2012,06,14
30,Good business hotel,"We stayed here for a business congress (and will return next year for the same congress)

I can't whine (like others) about the location being outside of Barcelona's tourist areas because we came for biz (and some fun of course!) and knew what to expect.  Besides, taxi's were plentiful at the hotel and there is a subway station paces away that takes you right into central Barcelona at the foot of Las Ramblas. Make no mistake this is a sterile, business hotel of which clones can be foud anywhere in the world.  There were no surprises, even service, clean rooms, the staff are all very well trained, courteous and do an excellent job of representing their employer from the lowest level to the senior staff, etc.  

On the plus side, we scheduled a business entertainment dinner at the nicer restaurant on top of the hotel (which had a great view BTW) and the service and food was outstanding. Our clients were all raving about the presentations and the taste of the food choices. In addition,the restaurant managers choices of moderately priced (which our event manager requested) but excellent quality Spanish wines were very good. A fact noted by one of our clients who is a bit of a wine snob.  

On the negative side, my assistant had written the hotel manager to see if he would give me a complimentary room upgrade since my group took a number of rooms for several days.  I got the upgrade (but had to pay 90 euros extra per night) and the manager wrote my assistant back crowing how I scored an upgrade....huh?  They also did the same thing to a V.P. in my company (who was led to believe it was complimentary....until he checked out). In addition, I was going to stay a few extra days for touring in Barce and wanted to check out to move to a more location friendly hotel in central Barcelona....when I went to check out they said no can do because your reservation had been confirmed for an extra 4 days and they wouldn't let me out of it.  After all the money we spent I thought it was a bush league call but had no choice but to stay for the duration.  This kind of soured the total experience and because of this I will limit our groups stay next year to the bare minimum of days in order not to have this experience again.  Their loss, not mine.

Would I stay there again?  Yes, but with limitations.  Nice business hotel, you will not be disappointed.",4,2012,06,10
30,"Amazing atmosphere. Evo a true experience..skyline restaurant, dining experience as good as the ones I've had at the Burj Al Ara","Sadly, the hotel couldn't accommodate the no smoking request made when booking, they offered to change it the following day, but that lost its momentum somewhere along the line.
The bar on the ground floor was a nice place to relax and the bar staff were very obliging. Requested ice one afternoon from room service was shocked to be told it would be ‚Ç¨5 for the privilege, that was later resolved, but obviously alarmed me in the extreme.
Room service was good. It was extremely frustrating though that every call made from the room, they asked what room number. 
There was no turn down service as far as I could see, but the automated curtains made up for that in part.
There was some banging and crashing going on outside the room, never really saw what it was. All in all though a good hotel, and not too far from the centre of town..",4,2012,06,10
30,Splendid Experience For The Realistic Folk,"Just returned from a Barcelona break and with plenty of good things to say about this hotel.
In every bit of publicity, it is quite clear that the hotel is out of town, so anyone who chicks a moody about its location is either illiterate, careless, or can't spot a metro station a few metres away from the hotel which sends air cooled trains into town.

You don't need a maths degree to operate the lifts, you just need to have a sense of humour and realise that if some oddball designer wants things this way, why not just go with the flow.

Me? I loved the shower and did not feel at all cheated by us getting a room on the tenth floor rather than hogher up. It is a hotel room for heaven's sake and just how many times can you ooh and aah at the view from the window anyway?

We rather enjoyed the breakfast and if treated as a main meal of the day, it is reasonably priced, including beautiful fresh fruit, cooked options and enough variety to ple;liease even the fussiest of eaters.

We found the staff at the hotel, without exception, to be courteous and helpful, often the case when you treat people as human beings, rather than believing that because you are in a five star , you are superior to those who are just doing their job.

The bathroom was as funky as they come and when it gets the thumbs up from Mister Froggie's good lady...you know it must be good.

We didn't use the shuttle, nearby spa facilities, or have dinner in the hotel. This said, everything about the hotel was very good and if you are lucky enough to get a room for the price we paid for it.....even better!",5,2012,06,09
30,"Adequate, just.","This hotel was adequate, just.  Do not delude yourself for a minute that this is a five star hotel, even if ‚Äì as I did ‚Äì you get it for a good price on Priceline or some other similar site and it is listed as five star.    I won‚Äôt repeat what others have said about the location, it wasn‚Äôt a problem for us, we caught a taxi and once caught the shuttle.  Even a taxi is only 12 Euros, which split between two was not a huge amount to pay, compared with the price of hotels in the centre of town you are certainly in front in terms of money.   So the main, probably the only, benefit of staying here is that it will save you money.

The main gripes I have are that the pillows are the strangest I have ever seen and I sleep in a lot of hotels.  On the bed is a long skinny pillow with very little stuffing, and in the cupboard are two European style square pillows.  Since I like a normal (in our part of the world) rectangular pillow, preferably of the feather variety, I phoned and asked for two feather pillows.  What I got was two, what they called, cervical pillows.  This is a rectangular pillow ‚Äì not feather ‚Äì that has no filling in the middle (see photo I will try to attach).  So now I had three strange pillows, none of which were conducive to sleep.  The bed was like a board of masonite and creaked as though it had seen quite a bit of trauma over the years.   Thus a comfortable nights‚Äô sleep was not to be had.  Nevertheless I did sleep, mainly due to the large amount of walking we did each day in Barcelona, but I would not go back to the Hesperia based purely on the quality of the bedding.  

The rest of the room was fine, and the shower was really good.  As others have mentioned, the hotel takes every available opportunity to price gouge you.  I rang and asked for some ice to the room, and was told there would be a 5 Euro charge.  Five star hotel indeed!  It took half an hour and four phone calls to get a porter with a trolley when we needed to check out.  Also not great when you have a flight to catch, but otherwise checkout was trouble free.   We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel due to the high cost, so my advice if you have already booked this hotel is to buy something in town before you return for the night, as others have advised.   

Another incident that is NOT the fault of the hotel but which is worthwhile knowing about is that I saw a drive by robbery out of a car just at the entrance to the hotel, a woman‚Äôs bag was snatched.  The warnings about robbery in Barcelona are real, so be careful when you are unloading to go into the hotel.

So again, in summary for the price this hotel is adequate.  I wish I had stayed in the 1898 where we were for the first two nights but you take a gamble on Priceline ‚Äì sometimes you win, sometimes you lose and it is true that the cost was a third of the 1898.",3,2012,06,08
30,Modern Hotel with a great location close to the Airport,"This hotel can be considered a great deal (price-wise) if you have to take a flight.  It is only 10 mins away from the airport and it has a free shuttle.  Be aware that if your flight is earlier than 8am, this will not work since their earlier shuttle is at 8am. 
It is not close to downtown but it has a free shuttle to Plaza Catalunya every hour or so.  This shuttle fills up quickly, so try to be 15 mins before the shuttle's departure.  There is Metro station just 5 mins away. Buy the T10 (which is a pack of 10 Metro passes) if you are planning the take the metro more than 5 time.  This pass can be shared between anyone and it is only 9.50 Euros.  You can buy it at any Metro station.
The Hotel is a beautiful and modern hotel and the rooms are stunning, definitely a 5 star standard.  This hotel would be too far if you are planning to be a tourist in Barcelona for a period longer than 2 days.",4,2012,06,07
30,Hot (In the Wrong Way) Hotel,"I had stayed here once before and loved it, so I booked a junior suite when I needed to overnight near Barcelona airport.  It is close, but with all the taxi surcharges, not much cheaper than going into the city.  The first room they put me into was a smoking room that reeked of smoke and the perfume they use to try and get rid of the smell--but it was huge.  The second room, the 24th floor, was HOT--and I mean hot and did not cool down.  The hallways and elevators in the hotel were also hot--and this on a day that Barcelona was warm, but certainly not hot.  When I moved rooms, and for that matter, when I checked in, no offer to help with the luggage.  So I would rate the service as so-so at best.  As for the room, other than the temperature and the fact that the carpets and upholstery a little worn, it was large and quiet.  Much worse experience than my last visit.  The hotel seems to have air conditioning issues and needs to address them.",2,2012,06,02
30,Great if you need to be close to the airport,"We stayed here one night during our time in Spain when we needed to be at the airport for an eaearly flight to San Sebastian after a few days on the Costa Brava.  The hotel is a modern business hotel - not what I would choose for an immersion in Catalan culture (we stayed at the Hotel Colon for our time in Barcelona), but it was extremely comfortable and just what we needed to not stress about making our morning flight.  The staff was very friendly and professional, and the room comfortable and well-appointed.",5,2012,05,29
30,Loved it!,"I have stayed in one of the top floor rooms and the view from the window was incredible! Extremely nice room, very modern. The interior of the hotel is amazing (aquarium floors and modern details make it very beautiful). The only negative point is food, it is very bad. I have ordered food to the room twice and I could not eat it, they can not even make a proper Ceasars salad! The the top floor restaurant is very beautiful, the view is amazing, but as far as I remember it is 100 euro p.p. for two course meal. The airport is very near, but the city centre is far, but the metro is only few steps away (3 mins walk to metro) and you can travel anywhere you want in Barcelona! It was the hotel I have spet my New Year 2011 and it was very fun!",5,2012,05,26
30,Overall we enjoyed our stay!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel June 2011. We arrived at the airport and waited hours for the shuttle to the hotel not knowing that it wasn't going to arrive at all, we realised this when another couple we met at the airport rang the hotel to be told by the hotel staff that the shuttle wasn't running at the time we arrived but this was mainly our fault as we hadn't properly checked the shuttle times, we just assumed the shuttle ran all day. We then had to get a bus to the hotel, this was very inconvenient as the bus was stuffed with people so we were stood up the whole way there with a large suitcase as well as trying to manouvere out of the way when someone wanted to get off at their stop which was very annoying. Luckily we had bought metro cards before we arrived at Barcelona which also worked on buses as well as the metro, you can collect these at the airport with no hassle - strongly recommened them! saves you money and makes a smooth experience and transition as well as having a booklet with lots of vouchers in to save you money on the sights and amenities. We arrived at the hotel and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the woman at the front desk kindly explained all the events that were going on the week we stayed, where they were and how to get there as well as handing us maps for the metro to help us out. We were offered an upgrade from a standard room which was an extra 50 euros a night, this sounds steep but was absolutely worth it, we got a larger bathroom, a larger room, a jacuzzi bath, a better view and complete use of the spa, the gym and the swimming pool. We weren't expecting too much but we walked into the room and were absolutely stunned at how big and clean the room was not to mention how beautiful the view was and this was only in the day, the view at night is gorgeous and made even better as the windows were so huge! Infact, at night times we would buy a couple of coronas and sit in and watch the view whilst playing a bit of music as a iPod docking station was also provided in the room. There is a garage nearby the hotel, across the street that sells alcohol and a pastry shop nearby also where we would buy breakfast, strongly recommend going there as the hotel charges extortionate prices for food and drinks but bare in mind it is a 5* hotel so it was to be expected, it was no trouble anyway as they were so close by. Ask at the front desk for the shuttle times if you fancy travelling into the city centre as well, this was very convenient if you dont fancy getting the metro or fancy walking to get the metro.

Overall I had a great experience, nothing made my holiday awful. Although, I would say that this hotel is geared more towards the business types and people that are willing to travel as it is quite out of the way from everything that is going on and each restaurant is so expensive BUT it is close to the airport and close to the metro which I strongly recommend using to get that Barcelona experience! The metro was no trouble for me but I did do a lot of walking, this might put some people off, if that is the case, I strongly recommened a hotel closer to the city centre. The food and drinks were very expensive but again this was no trouble as there was a garage and a bakery nearby. My boyfriend and I did happen to have only a couple of unpleasent experiences though, on the ground floor near the conference rooms there is an area outside next to a small water area with chairs and tables outside to relax, we both decided to each buy a drink and sit outside only to find out that when we decided to venture inside that the doors were locked... we were locked out. We had to climb over a gate at the side of the hotel to get back in! I felt like an escaped convict, luckily this was at night time so I felt less embarrassed as I don't think anyone saw us, we must've looked like idiots. The second time was when my boyfriend decided he wanted a dip in the swimming pool, he left the hotel room and came back 30 minutes later to tell me he hadn't even been in the pool because he couldn't find it! he explained to me that he walked through a gym, a spa and a sauna room, all full of naked men... he felt extremely embarrassed as he was wearing swimming shorts and had a towel ready for a swim, he told me that he asked the employees that worked at the spa where it was but none were helpful as neither of them spoke a word of english! Apparently we're not the first people to experience this either - some things to bare in mind. I guess some people, all things considered wouldn't rate this as high as we have but I think this is because we didn't let anything that happened ruin our experience. Oh, another thing, you get provided an ice bucket in your cupboard, do not request a member of staff to fill it and bring it up for you, as you will get charged. It's cheaper to take it down and fill it up yourself! Infact, it doesn't cost anything!",4,2012,05,24
30,Barcelona on the 25th Floor,"I must admit the hotel lived up to it's promise. We upgraded upon arrival because I wanted to have a more better type of suite and the fee was pretty reasonable. Had a Duplex suite (on the 25th floor) which is on two floors plus jacuzzi next to the bed, this included free access to the spa, especailly needed after the foot pounding around Barcelona!!! Could see a metro station nearby to the hotel but went into Barcelona using taxi services which cost around 13 euros on average and the ride itself only last about 15 minutes. 
The staff are very friendly and did not have a pompous attitude. The room was clean and tidied to a high standard. Did have some problems with the AC but this was quickly adressed with a phone call to reception and someone was up in a matter of minutes.
The location of the hotel to the airport made for a quick get away its about 10 minutes ride away, however inform the taxi driver who your carrier is, the terminal buidling is across three sites. ie, Easy Jet from terminal 2 building C which can save you a 10 minute walk!!!
I would certainly consider this hotel again if I returned to Barcelona.",4,2012,05,22
30,Solid choice for business meetings,"The hotel is located between the airport and the city centre. It is mainly a business hotel with excellent conferencing facilities.

I stayed there on business and was positively surprised by the friendliness and efficiency of the staff.  They responded to our needs quickly and nothing was too much trouble for them. The rooms on the higher floors have a nice view. Rooms are what I would expect of such a hotel. Decent size with the usual amenities and facilities. Quality of sleep was good.

Overall a solid choice for a business meeting. If visiting Barcelona I would not stay in the Hesperia Tower Hotel as it is too far from the centre and there is nothing around the hotel.",3,2012,05,16
30,Stayed here for weekend & F1,"Stayed here for a 4 night trip with my wife, whilst also going to the F1.  The hotel itself is very clearly not central, but is convenient for the airport, close to the metro station, and they run a shuttle bus which is very helpful, to the city centre.

The atrium and rooms are decordated to a very high standard, the views being excellent too, and were very clean.  This hotel is a smart example of alternative architecture and its nice that each room has a book about its development.  

On the downside, being so remote, be sure to plan your meals because if you fancy a night in after a long day out, the room service is very expensive, the restaurant even more so. 

Overall, this hotel was good value and a nice escape at the end of each long day, so long as you dont mind the journey.",4,2012,05,15
30,"Decent Hotel, Great Views","Cost including upgrade was 380 euro for 2 night which included upgrade to the tower club, which meant unlimited drinks as well as breakfast and daytime snack. Room was on 21st floor with great views and an amazing bathroom.

Some nice touches like complimentary chocolates delivered to the room every day and mineral water,although, while not being unfriendly i thought that the reception staff could be friendlier. About 20 minutes on the metro to the city centre which is 2 minute walk away and pretty handy for the airport as well.

All in all pretty good, maybe a little overpriced though.",4,2012,05,07
30,Very good hotel,"I can say for the price we paid with my wife , the Hotel was very good.
They gave a very nice room we had a very good view from our room to part of Barcelona, and just been in Barcelona is great , but the restaurant at the Hotel was very good specially the courteosu attendance of the people, and also the people who served for breakfast were poliote, and could help us in many ways .
to conclude I will recommend thsi Hotel and please make sure your room is what you requestd. 
For the price is was very good, also near the airport, and the shutlle service excelent.
don't misss the restaurant at the hotel, not the one in the top fllor , but the one at the third floor",4,2012,05,03
30,Cheap for a 5 star hotel,"The hotel's location is well out of town, at the end of line 1 on the metro nearer to the airport than the city centre. The metro however is only a short 3 minute walk through a neighbouring car park and it is about a 20 minute ride into all of the main tourist attractions. 

That being said, the rooms are great with some fantastic views of the city and the harbour.  I found it a very peaceful spot to relax after a days worth of pavement pounding around the sights. Overall I am very impressed with the value for money this place represented on the deal we got and would recommend anyone looking to get bang for buck as far as star rating is concerned.",4,2012,05,02
30,Very nice rooms,"The room had a very high standard. Nice floor to roof windows. Free wifi in the rooms, but the reception was not very good. Practical free airport shuttle. Took about 15 min to the airport, and only stops at terminal 1. ",5,2012,04,30
30,an ok hotel but very poor value for money - nothing special," My wife and I went there to celebrate out 10th wedding anniversary but while the view from the bedrooms is nice, in general, we were very, very  disappointed with this hotel.

 The prices for everything were 5*+ but I have had better food and service in 2* hotels in Spain, Ireland and the UK. The location is not great, as the hotel is like an island in a not very nice part of Barcelona. It is almost impossible to walk anywhere so we had to have a very expensive but rather tasteless dinner in the hotel the night of our arrival. Some of our food had come from the deep freeze and it had almost defrosted ice inside. 

The signage from the elevator that takes you from the underground car-park is minimalistic almost to the point of being invisible. We thought we were on the wrong floor and ended up wandering around until by chance we found the door that led to the bar/reception area.  The reception staff were friendly up to a point but were quite ""remote"". At no time did anyone offer to help us with our bags. 

The room itself was ok but once again nothing very special. The note pad they left on the bedside table only had three sheets of paper and wasn't replace the next day by room service. 

The batroom was adequate but the door on the shower cubicle wasn't very good and anytime we had a wash, we ended up with a large pool of water escaping onto the bathroom floor. The quality of the toiletries was once again adequate but once again nothing exceptional. I mention this because I have stayed in other hotels where the price per night was half and the overall quality was way, way much better.

My biggest gripe was with the exorbitant prices the hotel charges for things like coffee, 4 Euro for a white coffee, around 18 Euro for breakfast per person (not included in a room price of nearly 150 Euro per night,. How can a cup of coffee and a croissant be? Another thing which surprised me was the sheer cost of t of two nights parking in the underground car par. This for me  was another example of the hotel's ""let's rip our customers off where-ever we can"" attitude. 

My recommendations are 1, look for another hotel, 2, if you do plan to stay here, don't bring your car, 3. don't eat in the restaurant if you want to avoid over-priced tasteless food, 4. Bring a kettle and a few tea bags! At least in the UK a kettle is available in the lowliest B&B.

A memorable 10th anniversary weekend, but for the wrong reasons.

30,Great hotel and Great location (if you're in Barcelona on business),"excellent hotel--extremely clean and the staff was incredibly kind and always polite.  Great bartender.  :)  The rooms are clean and quiet and the breakfast buffet is a definite must.  This hotel isn't really close to downtown (nothing a taxi ride can't fix) but it's got great proximity to both the convention center and the airport, which makes it a great choice for the business traveler.  I've always loved Barcelona and now love this hotel.",5,2012,04,23
30,"Excellent hotel, perfect to avoid the tourist crowds","Firstly, the location. If you want to be in the centre of the El Raval or La Rambla this might not be for you. It's about a 20 minute metro ride from the main tourist hubs. You can be in Barcelonetta in about 30 and the camp nou in about 15. it is close to the airport however and a local bus stops right outside.

For me, the location is a perfect way to avoid the scrum further central. Based at the end of one of the main metro lines, this hotel is a lovely slice of Catalan luxury. Marble, crome and some cracking views add up to great value. Managed to get the hotel for a bargain as a lastminute secret hotel, so no complaints here! 

Would definitely stay here again",5,2012,04,23
30,Worth the money!,"My husband and I stayed here over Easter weekend, we arrived around 8.30pm and given a room on the 22nd floor the views were amasing! But during the day not much too look at! Breakfast buffet had a great selection but it's usually 24 euros which I think is really expensive however they had a offer on that weekend where breakfast was only 16 euros each. Rooms are immaculate, there's no bath but the shower is amasing by far the best shower in a hotel I have ever had! Beds are two large singles pushed together so not overly romantic however comfy enough. We knew it was not in the city centre so were prepared for the metro, it is the last stop on the line and is at least 15 stops to catalunya by the rambles which we didn't know so as long as your prepared to travel it won't be a problem. We didn't use the spa and at 12 euros each wouldn't bother anyway - there is far too much to see in the city centre. All in all a really good hotel and a fabulous city.",5,2012,04,13
30,"fantastic hotel and service, great service","well worth paying for upgrade to include the Tower club room, access to breakfast drinks and snacks free all day, food in the 2nd floor restaurant was lovely. paying for upgrade also gave us room high up in the building which had great views, the hotel just looked amazing decor was just what we liked, great room and shower, loads of mirrors and shiny services. used the free shuttle to the airport, Metro is just outside the front of the hotel in the carpark of the hospital, well worth using 15mins to get into the centre, T10 was 9.25E for 10 tickets so great value, and so easy to use. If you phone the hotel from the airport you can find out shuttle bus times, or just get on the 46 bus you will see the hotel on the way only 2E each also. if you want to see the Sargrada Familia book on-line tickets as this will avoid the queue, which was very very long or go later in the day. it seems all attractions have a on-line ticket purchase that seems to avoid the queue, so well worth checking before hand. All in all would use the hotel again even though was out of town a bit, was easy to get to great service and quiet and fantastic looking and decor.",5,2012,04,11
30,Excellent - only if you pay extra,"Near the airport, but literally opposite the metro station so is very accessible to Barcelona. Hotel itself is great amazing decor, Michelin star restaurant, but I recommend paying extra for a Tower Club room. This means you get access to drinks and snacks all day and get to use the spa facilities - all included in price. Also you are on a higher floor so the views are better. ",5,2012,04,08
30,Not for families,"We selekter this hotel specifically because of the pool and spa. Suites toguheld spacious, were nor adjacent ad requested, one stank of smoke, staff did move us. The swimming pool was for over 18s only !! Which we had specifically asked about for our children. All in all just lacks the touch of a 5 star hotel.
The hotel seems more catered for business meetings (certainly not 5 star) than families.",2,2012,04,06
30,Good business hotel - handy for the Fair,"good facilities with comfortable rooms and great views. Quiet, even in a room right by the lifts. Decor a little on the excesive side with glass and mirrors everywhere but comfortable bed, good shower and FREE Wifi, which is becoming a rarity these days. 
Breakfast is extra and expensive but is abundant and caters for all kinds of tastes.
Location is handy for the fair, the industrial area nearby and the airport - a short taxi ride - and not far from Barcelona city so good for business if you have to work in that area.",4,2012,04,02
30,Nice place for business trip,"Located outside of Barcelona, the hotel is not for a tourist, but it's perfect for exhibition or conference as it's near the airport and Fila de Barcelona. 
Moreover, room is clean, people are nice and food is O.K. I'd strongly recommand the meeting room of Tower Club, which is perfect for less than 8 persons.
One weak point is that you've to type the WIFI password again and again.",5,2012,03,30
30,Great place!!!,"Spent one night here at the end of a cruise.  Great location, easy access to downtown and the airport.  The views from our 24th floor room were fantactic.  Complimentary shuttle to the airport and into the center of the city (Plaza Cataluna).  Friendly and helpful staff, clean hotel, except for a little mold in the shower.  The breakfast buffet was very nice.  Check out the restaurant on the top of the hotel.  Pricey, but the view of Barcelona from there is unbeatable.",5,2012,03,29
30,Lovely Hotel,"I booked through a low-cost last moment website, so I paid ¬£50 for the night. For that cost, this hotel was just amazing. The staff were very welcoming and helpful despite the price I'd paid. 
The bar was nice for a couple of post-flight beers before settling down to a meal. 
The 2nd floor restaurant (I forget the name) was fantastic, the prawns I had for main course must have been the biggest prawns ever. 
The room was a good size and standard, although entering through the bathroom seems a little odd, I assume it is to allow the guest to be as far from the corridor as possible. Consequently I slept really well on the very comfortable bed.",5,2012,03,29
30,Lovely hotel! Not just for business travellers!,"We stayed here on our first trip to Barcelona and loved it! excellent value for money, the room was amazing! Initially we were slightly worried about our stay as we are a young couple (19 and 20 years old) but they treated us with respect and were very helpful! Hotel is a bit out from Barcelona but it literally right outside a metro stop so that was no problem at all for us! Overall a great stay and would highly recommend!",5,2012,03,20
30,Would not recommend,"I actually stayed at this hotel in Nov of 2010 but I kept forgetting to write the review, I feel like this review will help a lot of travelers so I wanted to post it.  We were here for a conference so we did not actually select this hotel but it looked great in pictures.  The decor is really cool and the bathrooms in the rooms are nice and large.  

The restaurant in the hotel had terrible food and the service was really poor, not because it was slow but because our waiter was rude.  There were 6 of us and all 6 were disappointed.  I pulled back my sheets and saw some small bugs (the bed bug thing was going on and I was freaked out).  We called down to the front desk for a change of sheets.  When housekeeping brought us a new set - they were dirty or had stains on them.  Our next effort was to call down and ask to change rooms.  The put us in a new room, so we took our key card to the new floor.  We opened the door to our new room to find someone else sleeping in there.  I completed freaked out and no longer felt safe.  That poor person must have been terrified too.  The front desk was horrible in handling this situation - they were not helpful and were quite combative.  We drove back to H1898 for the remainder of our stay.

I am not the type of person who wants to give a bad review as revenge - this is merely to help out anyone thinking of staying in this hotel.  If I can prevent one person from having my same experience it will be worth it.  I felt like we tried to be patient by three different attempts to remedy the situation and none of them worked.

Also, the location is terrible, if you want to be close to the city center and where the action is, this is definitely not the place for you.",1,2012,03,01
30,Immaculate hotel for business travellers,"This hotel is a landmark in the local area, visible as you come in to land at Barcelona airport. It is a very tall tower with pristine rooms featuring a fantastically modern bathroom and very spacious sleeping areas. I have visited a couple of times now and the reception staff are always very helpful, with good instructions on how to get to the central train station using the metro system. The one down side is the hotel is not near the centre of the city, so probably not the best location for couples to head to on holiday - but for business users, it's ideal.",5,2012,02,26
30,"Great hotel, especially if visiting expo center",Nice design once you cope with the black and mirror 'permanence'.,4,2012,02,26
30,Comfort away from the crowd,"The hotel is a very large facility. rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, bathroom is large and well-equipped.
Weirdly enough, you enter your room directly in the bath-room (probably to save sqm of a useless corridor). Nice view on illumination of the surroundings.

Common spaces and lobby are really modern design.

Reception is providing a good service.

Metro within reasonnable distance to partially overcome the ""in the middle of nowhere"" syndrom. It is not inside city for good and for bad - no sightseeing in the vicinity - but it doesnot have the stress - and the traffic jam - of the city centre.

Really depends on your visit purpose",4,2012,02,21
30,Very comfortable stay,"Stayed here for business - room was very quiet, which I much appreciated. The gym is excellent - huge, has all things you need. Breakfast was not included as such, but was quite tasty. Internet was included for me. The shower is very cool - has three settings, which are great fun. Altogether a good stay, would recommend for business. Bit far out for Barcelona city visitors though, might not be right for a weekend stay in town...",4,2012,02,16
30,Some of the best food in Europe,"The Hesperia tower is a great base from which to explore the fantastic city of Barcelona. 
The rooms are very modern and comfortable, the facilities very good.
It is quite away outside of the city but is within 500 metres of the metro station so getting around is easy. 
The restaurants in Barcelona are brilliant the influence of ""El Bulli"" is obvious everywhere.
If the weather's good don't miss Parc G√ºell and if the weather's not so good eat in Mercat de la Boqueria the seafood grill is to die for.
Food & ambiance at 41‚Å∞ cocktail bar is amazing but you need to book from U.K, a long way in advance.",4,2012,02,14
30,Very nice hotel but too far from centre of Barcelona,This hotel is very modern and everything is built to a high standard but it seems to be located in the middle of nowhere. There is a metro station close by but it still takes about 30 mins to reach the centre of the City and there is absolutely nothing to do or see in the area around the hotel. The hotel itself and the service is excellent but I think next time I'd prefer to stay somewhere more central and I think this hotel is more targeted at business travellers who are attending a conference rather than tourist guests.,4,2012,02,14
30,Superb!,"I spent 2 nights there on leisure purpose, 1 year ago.

Beeing used to stay 4 and 5* hotels, I really have to admit I greatly appreciated my stay there. Great rooms, great health center, supper breakfast and friendly staff. 
To recommend.
Easy access to city centre, as there is metrop stop next to the hotel.",5,2012,02,13
30,bad experience...,"I have spent many days overthere for business travel. This hotel has a very nice interior with confortalbe rooms. The staff at reception desk are very pleasant. The bad points are the situation and the security! Even in a 5 stars hotel, some thefts can enter easily in the hotel... and I am very disappointed by the way it has been managed by the direction. None compensation has been given back, even after staying there for 4months. Just inacceptable for a 5 stars hotel. Not sure to go back again.",2,2012,02,01
30,Stunning views from the top level,"My wife and I visited this hotel during our roundtrip through Spain. We know before we booked this hotel that the service was not all 5 stars but as the rooms were that beautiful and the location ideal for us this was no big problem.
After all the service of the hotel was good, but could be better for a 5 star hotel as said before this was no problem for us.

We booked the Duplex Suite and it was on the last floor of the hotel with breathtaking views over the city. The hotel room was great with two floors and a beautiful whirlpool in the sleeping room that gave stunning views over the city. Everything was perfect in the room. Also we did one evening room service. The food was good, not spectacular but worth the money.

Breakfast was very good with a lot of choice and one plus there was Nespresso coffee with all the blends available. 

The location of the hotel was at the end of the metro tube so you had to travel a huge distance but no longer as half an hour. For us this was great because we didn‚Äôt want a hotel in the city center so we could reach the hotel easy with our car. Also they offer safe parking under the hotel. If you don‚Äôt want to be away of the city and don‚Äôt like metros and don‚Äôt want to spend money on taxis this isn‚Äôt the hotel for you. 

Overall we can highly recommend this hotel to others. You get a very nice room for en descent price.",5,2012,01,31
30,Modern European,"My stay at Hesperia Tower was during the MWC 2011 and it is one of the fine modern European Hotel in Barcelona. Easily accessible from Las Ramblas and Fira, comfortable and spacious rooms, close to Metro station, yet away from the frentic activity of downtown Barcelona. The breakfast at the hotel is lavish and overall a good stay at Hesperia Towers. Would love to come back again.",4,2012,01,18
30,This Hotel has the wow factor  BUT,"Got an excellent deal on this hotel,plus flights through Expedia. Caught the 46 bus from the airport,cost around 2Euros. When you arrive at this hotel it certainly does have the wow factor. Efficient check in,was offered a room upgrade for 50Euros a night,also breakfast for 15Euros instead of 24.Both offers we declined. We went every morning for coffee and croissants to the 365 cafe,4Euros for two! The rooms have been described in detail by previous contributors,suffice to say very good.Maid service slipped up on a couple of occasions,left dirty glasses from the night before and did not change the towels when they clearly needed changing. No tea/coffee making facility which is very disappointing for a five star hotel.
The cost of eating in this hotel is extortionate.First night we went to the Bistro,both had burger and chips,plus a glass of wine each,bill 47Euros! A coffee and a tea in the lounge area 10Euros! There is no where else to eat anywhere around this hotel,and having spent the days in the city centre,we did not feel inclined to get back on the Metro again to go out in the evening.The one time we did want eat in the hotel was New Years eve,to be told ""fully booked,but we can recommend restaurants in town"" The only alternative was room service which was very efficient and very  good. The transport links to town are very good,Metro close by and takes 25 minutes to Pl Catalunya.We bought a T10 ticket which is good value at 9Euros.Also buses stop nearby,we took a trip to Sitges,nice scenery and this is a lovely little town.Takes about 40minutes on the bus. On the return to the airport the hall porter suggested to us we might like to use the shuttle bus which was just leaving,very helpful. Overall we are very pleased to have stayed at this hotel,it was an experience, just too isolated.We would not return,instead we would stay in the city.",4,2012,01,17
30,Our best choice for airport,"I stayed with my wife for a single night between two flights so closeness to the airport and convenience was a must. 
We arrived to the airport late in the night and got to the hotel in a taxi. We paid only minimum service from the airport (which was like 20‚Ç¨, so its not very cheap anyway) and took just about ten or twelve minutes. However, the access to the hotel is a bit tricky so keep it in mind if you are driving there. Our taxi driver got confused and had to take a long diversion to get it right.
The hotel lobby is beautiful and really felt five stars. Staff was helpful.
We got a so called ""superior"" room which in my opinion, did not stand to that name. It was on the 14th floor so the view was nice, altough it would have been nicer from the other side of the building. Amenities and appliances were just ok for a five star hotel, and bedroom  was reasonably well designed and luxuriously furnished, but not very roomy and the wardrobe was ridiculous. 
We got up very early and checked out. Apparently there is a free cofee and some pastries for those who leave very early before regular breakfast starts. We were ""unlucky"" as they had just retired the free coffee and regular breakfast did not start yet.
After that, we picked up some daily press for free and got to the airport comfortably in the hotel shuttle, also for free. That was certainly good added value for the departure. I would recommend checking the shuttle schedule in advance with the hotel if you plan to use it. It departs form the hotel every 40min.",4,2012,01,16
30,"World class, but isolated","To be frank, I wasn't expecting much: I only booked in here because it was close to the airport, and I had an early flight. And that is both an obvious advantage and a disadvantage....you're a long way from the city centre. Having established that, I can only say I was amazed by the place. It is indeed a tower...with a spectacular view from the bar/restaurant on the top (food is by the late Santi, a Michelin-starred chef....but since I don't like his style of food, I didn't eat there).
This is the most extraordinarily hi-tech place I've ever stayed in....the lifts alone are a revelation! The room was equally hi-tech, and wonder of wonders, everything worked! The decor, while modern, is not aggressively so; my small room was almost 'cozy', decorated in shades of taupe, purple, and tan, and was extremely restful. The bed was a delight, and the bathroom....once you got used to being in a hall of mirrors, was more than adequate. 
I'm not used to staying in the smaller rooms in any hotel, but this one was fine for one person, and I imagine the larger ones are wonderful.
The staff were terrific; the barman expert; and the ladies who served breakfast were charming, helpful and bright. That's another thing; I was advised by the splendid young man who checked me in ""You really MUST have breakfast, even if you have to get up a bit earlier"". I took his advice, and was astounded at the variety, quality, and freshness.
As I pointed out, this is NOT a city-centre hotel, and there's nothing to do or see within walking distance. On the other hand, you probably won't get mugged (this is the scourge of Barcelona in particular, and in too many other Spanish cities....something has to be done about that).
I liked this place so much, in fact, that I may stay there in future, and risk a cab-ride into town!",5,2012,01,12
30,"Very nice rooms, would not book for conference","The hotel is close to the airport, which makes access easy (I think there is a shuttle but I did not use it). Reception staff were efficient during check in. There are 4 elevators and you have to select the floor you want to go to before the elevator arrives. This is at first a nice hi-tech touch, but becomes a real issue in a conference.

The rooms are very nice. I was actually excited by the room, and that does not happen often :-) When you enter, you step into the closet/bathroom immediately. There is a door that leads to the bedroom. Bathroom is done in a black design with lots of mirrors, shower is good and the whole area is very spacious. Bed is comfortable and the room is functional.

Breakfast is ok, although nothing to die for. Being used to the Hilton breakfast, I missed a few items. The breakfast room is very small (capacity maybe of 150?) compared to the large conference facilities. We were a group of 250 and it got packed just before the event  started, so can't imagine anything over that.

The lobby and conference facilities are done in a nice, modern design. Nothing to complain about there. But the group meals are mediocre. Also nearby the main conference room for I'd say 1600 pax, there is one set of bathrooms, the ladies with 5 stalls. That is completely insufficient if you're dealing with a bigger amount of people. 

The foyer of the main hall has a nice outside area where the coffee breaks extend.

Now the elevators... When trying to get a group of less than 200 pax to their rooms to change for their afternoon activities, it becomes a nightmare. I can't imagine if everyone was going. There was a line of people from the lobby to the elevators, and we were waiting so long in the line that people who have got in their rooms first managed to get changed and return to the lobby before we were even half through the line. It took at least half an hour for all of us to reach our rooms, so the programs were delayed. This is caused by the elevator system as well as 4 elevators with capacity about 8 pax. Insufficient.

As the breakfast restaurant is not on the lobby level, you are facing similar problems in the morning.

The lobby bar is ok, again wasn't impressed but no complaints either.

All in all the stay was good, reasonable price, but I would not return. It's too far from the city to stay here during a vacation, but too inconvenient to orgaize a conference.",4,2012,01,11
30,Lovely hotel but a bit far out of town.,"My boyfriend & I booked the Hesperia Tower as a top secret hotel on Last minute.com so we didn't know exactly where we were staying but just that it had views over the city. 
The hotel was really nice, the rooms absolutely lovely with so much attention to detail. We did find that it was a little far from everything & would probably stay closer to town for another city break but near to the airport & a lovely hotel with friendly staff.

We did have a problem with the water (taps/shower) in our room when we first arrived (there wasn't any) but this was sorted by the next morning.",4,2012,01,10
30,"Good location, good rooms bad service","Great location, 3 min walk to the metro, ped mall nearby. Picked this hotel as we needed two bedrooms and they have an adjacent aparthotel. 

Found the front desk staff to be unfriendly, unhelpful and slightly incompetent. Check in time is 12, our room was not available until almost 5pm, with no recourse-only seemed irritated that we were exhausted and frustrated.",4,2012,01,09
30,We loved our stay!,"Excellent 5 star hotel, in each and every detail. Rooms are very confortable, have enough space and great view! Shower is excellent! Room service is fast and very good (has a ‚Ç¨5 charge). We went by car but did not used it, because they have a handy metro station right in front of the hotel. The location of this hotel is not so great, and it takes about 20min by metro to Pl. Catalunya, but it worth staying, specially when you get a good deal! Barcelona has a great metro system, so enjoy your stay at this hotel as we did!",5,2012,01,07
30,AWESOME except the tap water that tastes really bad,"truly great hotel, awesome bathrooms and showers...clever and tastefull lighting in the corridors, everything is charming.

may be the hall and the bar could be better but to go out just use the metro station 5 minutes from the hotel. Really worth 20 minutes of tube travel compare to be in a boring hotel in center town.

ONE BAD POINT : the tap water tastes really disgusting you can not drink it. so buy water bottles if you don't want to empty the minibar",5,2012,01,07
30,Holiday stay to remember,"this time we've spent here 9 nights in this excellent hotel with my wife. i've stayed here also previously and that's why i returned. it is located on the halfway from airport to the city - providing regular and free shuttles to and from airport and to the centre of the town (Plaza Catalunya - just be there few mins earlier so you can fit into the bus for 13 people). the place is still in great condition and people enjoying 5star hotels won't be disappointed. i advise to book breakfast at place (which is 40% cheaper than via internet  15eur instead of 24) and you can even upgrade to suite for 50/night which includes breakfast and SPA entrance as well (otherwise 12eur/person per entrance). our room was on 19th floor with the view on the city - that was remarkable. better than the other side. while visiting the surroundings we've found a lovely coffee called 365 where they bake and prepare nice croissants every morning at great prices, so you can enjoy you mornings even there. what else to say. our stay was fantastic, room was nice, cleaned every day, just you have to renew your internet connection more often (same pass/code each time) throughout the day. otherwise, for the price - unbeatable stay. highly recommend.",5,2012,01,06
30,Maybe I'm just a moaning old git,"We booked this as a ""Mystery Hotel"" and I've often been really pleasantly surprised when I've made similar arrangements.

After looking at other people's comments, I have to agree that the Hesperia Tower is smart, stylish and right at the cutting edge of design. The staff are indeed well informed, friendly and helpful - and the housekeeping is impeccable - with the exception of a bit of damage in one of the lifts that looked worryingly like a bullet hole - not that I'm an expert.

So - what's the problem?

Well.. The lifts have this very weird and not very responsive lift control which requires quite an in depth understanding of computer technology - I'm a techie myself but I do prefer a simple button

the rooms have a slightly strange layout - you walk straight into an open plan dressing /bathroom area and through into the bedroom. For me I value the sanctuary of the porcelain and found it slightly unsettling - as did my wife. Plus the bathroom is lined with mirrors which present you with a panorama of you in all your glory. I guess some of the younger visitors appreciate this feature but, for me,  I really don't need to see myself in 360 degrees when I'm on the toilet

We were high up but the location is not such as to provide inspiring views.

The bar/restaurant and lobby are again furnished in a  very avant garde fashion which I'm sure cost a fortune and represents the ne plus ultra, but the lighting is very subdued and I had a bit of difficulty working out whether the chairs and tables were in fact chairs and tables or art installations.

So - amazing building - but we found it slightly unsettling - we also seemed to end up sharing the lift with the same French Sugardaddie trying to suck his babe's face off on every day of our stay.

The location is typical inner suburbia and the metro station involves a 10 minute walk - we didn't manage to work out whether there was an airport or city centre shuttle or not, but there's always a couple of taxis close by - airport was about 20 euro/ 10 minute ride away",3,2012,01,05
30,Beautiful hotel in a beast of an area,"Tips:
1. Bus stop is just across the road. It's the number 46- every 20mins. That can take you to and from the airport ( getting to the airport, you get off at the Hopsital Oncologico stop.
2. It's around 15Euro's in a taxi but it takes the same timing as the metro which takes 25mins
3. Tubes are every 2mins. *** But a 10 stop ticket for 8/9 euro's which you can also use on the bus! Nearest tube is 100m across the park. station called Bellvidge.
4. No kettle or iron in room
5. Gym, pool and jacuzzi is 12euro's per person per day
6. There is a 365 cafe,donner kerbab shop and bar around the corner
7. Hotel supplies you with: Toothbrush, toothpaste, sponge, soap, body moisturiser, shampoo, shower gel, tissues, slippers, shoe horn, sewing kit, shoe shine, razor, shaving cream, plenty of towels, matches ( new toiletries each day)
8. Don't waste money on meals out all the time- supermarkets are cheap for a picnic on the beach- baguette, salami, cheese, crisps and drink costs 7euros for 2 people!
9. The restaurants off side streets tend to be better e.g. marisc co
10. Water is expensive in Barcelona. In the hotel it is 7euros- the same as fine wine!
11. Visit the Gaudi work- it's spectacular!

Good:
 hotel lift system very efficient! touch screen where you press your location before lift arrives.

nicely decorated

Electric curtains

Sound proof rooms- don't hear anyone in thenext room

clean hotel

very attentive

We got a free upgrade as we asked for a smokers room

shower is fast! 

You get His and Her's sinks

Comfy bed

first night you are given a free bottle of water and tasty cakes

Bad:
Air-con in smoking room is bad- un-useful for myself when i don't smoke and my partner does

restaurants expensive!!! Evo restaurant is ¬£150 per person on normal night minus drinks!!! Bouguet is rubbish- food is minimal and the waitresses keep offering you bread and more drinks- won't leave you alone!

Location- whilst we will travel for a better hotel, it's a very deprived area! be careful of pickpockets! I was warned several times

Maids barged into our rooms when we was half naked without so much as a knock on the door!! this was in the late afternoon as they came to ask if our minibar needed stocking up!

They tried to charge us for using the phone when we never used it. We both have our phones and apparently we dialled a house in barcelona's number when we don't know anyone in Barcelona.

Minibar is expensive

Laundry service is expensive- 4.5euros alone to wash knickers!",4,2012,01,03
30,Hesperia Tower Review,"If I have awful Spanish, I apologise in advance. Hesperia Tower es un hotel brillante y el servicio fue excepcional. Me encantar√≠a volvi a visito.",5,2011,12,30
30,First class,"I loved this hotel.  We arrived the middle of the night and the staff was great. We were starving and there were no restaurants around the hotel. Luckily after midnight they offer a ""lunchbox""mfor less than 20euros  We ordered it, not sure what we would get  it was a huge sandwich, large salad, and an assortment of desserts.  
Our room was exquisite and we had amazing views. 
Breakfast was included with our stay. Each day we enjoyed the massive buffet. 
The hotel is near the airport, but there is a metro station across the street. This makes it easy to get around.",5,2011,12,18
30,Something different,The hotel is very close to the airport. They advertise that there is a shuttle bus between airport and the Hesperia Tower but that is incorrect. You can take a bus from the airport to the bus-stop across the 6 lane road and haul your bags across the road  to the hotel or you can take a taxi. The hotel is something entirely different. You enter the room through the 'bathroom' so to say. But it's very nice and nicely decorated. Since the bathroom is all in black and the roof also black it gives you a deep three dimensional sensation. The room is comfortable. Food in the hotel is acceptable.,4,2011,12,09
30,A wonderful experience,"I only stayed one night but the hotel was amazing, the suite was very clean, the shower was very powerful and plenty of hot water.  Didn't try the jacuzzi bath - not enough time.  I had room service and the meal was delivered in a hot cupboard, very good idea - the food was delicious.  Slept very well in a  very comfortable bed.  The breakfast buffet was plentiful and tasty.  The only complaint I have is the lift system which is quite complicated and can be very slow at busy times.",4,2011,12,08
30,Amazing Night View,"Last week I had the opportunity to stay on the 16th floor of Hesperia Tower 5* hotel - one of Barcelona¬¥s tallest towers rising up to a height of over 100 m. 
This famous city landmark was designed by prestigious architect Richard Rogers in collaboration with Alonso & Balaguer.

A night view from my room was truly amazing, watched it for a few hours instead of a TV.",5,2011,12,06
30,Not Centrally Located in Barcelona,"While the hotel itself was lovely, it was located 20 minutes by metro from the center of town.  The hotel did offer a shuttle into the City, but you had to take the metro back (which was located across the street about 5 -7 min. walk).  Also, the neighborhood was dead:  no shops, cafes, etc. Food at the hotel was very expensive (breakfast 15 euros if you booked the day before; otherwise 24 euros.  We paid 10 euros for 2 cups of coffee.  No coffee/tea making facilites in room; ice delivered was 5 euros. On the other hand, staff very friendly; free wi-fi.",3,2011,12,06
30,Fantastic!!,"Were do I even start.. Me and my girlfriend went to Barcelona for my 21st birthday and the hesperia tower is where we decided to stay. On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly porter who help us with our luggage, he was very knowledgeable and had lots to tell us about, he was great! When checking in we decided to upgrade our room as it wasn't that much extra and we had the most amazing room with an incredible view overlooking the city. We thought we might have problems as the hotel is just outside the city but this turned out to be no problem. I'd definitely recommend staying here and I hope to go back!",5,2011,12,05
30,Hisperia Tower Hotel,"This hotel was a real treat, although some distance from Barcelona town center because it is on the outskirts. However, it is right next to the train station and proved no problem, as long as you allow at least half an hour for travelling. In August the weather was good, so travelling was easy. There is very little else of interest in the area.
The hotel itself was clean and offered many facilities.The suites were clean and comfortable, with fantastic views across the city and the airport. The breakfast was in the lounge area and was fine. I probably wouldn't book for a family holiday or romantic weekend since it is quite isolated from the main tourist attractions. Good for business trips though.",4,2011,11,30
30,super,"Super fine hotel, staff nice, food wonderfull, very convininet near the metro station, quickly reach any destination. Bed very confortable, rooms are clean and the dizain in the room is fascinating. Especially in the bath area. Everywhere mirrors. :)",5,2011,11,23
30,Cant fault this hotel,"Like people have said before, twenty mins from airport and so on, but the hotel is fab fab fab.
Staff really friendly the room  was clean warm very stylish , but the breakfast was the best i have ever had. It was 18 euro each but well worth it, I would take two pages to list everything on offer!
Next time we will definetly go back there",5,2011,11,18
30,GREAT FOR ROOM ONLY!,"Last min . com did a great deal, 3 nights bargain ¬£207.00
20 mins from airport and 20 mins to Barcelona, min 20 euro s via taxi, hotel offer a courtesy bus which is great, but has set times with no mid day service.
Dont get breakfast, there is 365 bakery round the corner, and the coffee is excellent!
really enjoyed our stay here, rooms are fantastic,
only disappointment no tea making facilities which if your British you really need.
overall great.",5,2011,11,14
30,Worth it,"Overall great place to stay, good friendly service, good well designed extremely comfortable rooms, jet spray showers but no bath tub in basic rooms.
Access to spa facilites, not free but high quality. Shuttle service - is ok as long as you coincide your daily time table with it! Taxi from airport has min fare 20 euros even if hotel is 10 mins away. true that elevator does take some time and is a bit chaotic to operate. Free wi fi and we managed to print boarding passes from printer. Views are great throughout. getting into town with metro absolutely no issue. A great stay, food was excellent too even though we only took room service. Recommend this place, it is worth it.",5,2011,11,13
30,Very beautiful room,"Very comfortable room with a large and inviting bathroom. Slightly out of the centre of town so we did have to take taxis. Very good value for money. Check-in took a little while as it was very busy. Glass elevators on the outside of the building are a great way to see the rest of the city - all the way down to the harbour. We only had room service which was very good, but did not eat in any of the restaurants. The shower is a wonderful idea with different settings and the bathroom amenities were great.",5,2011,11,13
30,Very beautiful sight of the Neighborhood,"The staff of the reception are friendly,  beautiful lobby and excellent breakfast, nice room with  perfect view of neighborhood of Barcelona the wi-fi is for free. What I did not like is  the location to the city was far away the  train station was 22 minutes to the city and the cost of taxi 20 euro,  Reception staff don't call for the taxi you need to wait outside if you have luck finding a taxi, the bell boy only works half shift until morning to afternoon and  after that you should take your own luggage to your room. The pool and jacuzzi package is not included, it costs 12 euros  person a night, There Policy: Guest that have suite rooms, pool and jacuzzi is not a charge? The jacuzzi was very cold the Lifeguard said it must be 33 degrees, the jacuzzi for me was like ice. Hostess at breakfast  does not ask the name of guest of the room, she only asked the number of the room and i got charge by mistake,  Hostess did not check the guest room by his name. There is a Shuttle to the city and airport, a van with only 15 person that you can't  register.",3,2011,11,13
30,Great and Average!,"We have just returned from three nights at the Hesperia Tower and enjoyed ourselves but was both pleased and disappointed  at the same time.  It was a special celebration weekend for our daughters 18th.  We booked two rooms and that night the shower leaked through to the toilet and flooded the bathroom area through the walls which also housed your wardrobe/suitcase and shoe area.  We moved the following morning but it was a bit of a palarva as they said we would have to leave everything on the bed as the rooms were not ready and we wanted to go to the city.  Then they telephoned and said that they were ready and someone was coming up, so it was all a bit of a rush.  The hotel windows in the hallways also leak on to the shiny surfaces which become lethal and this happened on both floors we were on.  
The reception staff were lovely and helpful, the guys in the foyer called Lewis and Robert were really nice and helpful 5 stars to them!.  The shuttle service we used twice and that was  great too.  
The breakfast booked the night before at 15 euros each was a big disappointment.  Thought the food would be fantastic and it wasnt.  The toaster broke and my husband had chosen his breakfast and they said they would fix the toaster, when it worked they came over to tell us by which time my husbands breakfast was cold as he went to make toast, thought they would have brought the toast over in a 5 star if there toaster didnt work!! They said they would reheat it, something you are not supposed to do, we said no and he helped himself to another breakfast. The breakfast was very average for the price.  Another couple had also eaten dinner there and they said the same for the price. service not amazing in this department compared to reception and lewis and Robert!
There are no baths just power showers in some of the rooms.
We got a secret room via lastminute and got a fair price so it was ok. We would return as it was quiet, comfortable and pleasant.
The safe in the room is free as well.
There are no kettles or irons and a cuppa cost you 4.50 euro,s! There is a great cafe with lovely locals behind the spa area next door, called 365 delicious coffee and croissants for 1.50 euros!! The supermarket is next door to that cafe and is excellent and there is a donner kebab shop and a little bar which we did not use.
We jumped on a bus from the airport took 5 mins which was number 46 and got off at the Hopsital Oncologico andcrossed over to the hotel, 1  mins! the metro is only 5 mins 100 metres away and so easy and cheap to use. We bought the two day use certain buses and metro anywhere for 11 euros each for two days you can also buy a 10 trip for 8 euros or a one day or three day pass. We went to all the usual places with it excellent value.  We thought the highlight of the trip was the fountains at night, get off at espana stop and walk up to near the art gallery cant miss it, colourful and musical!",3,2011,11,09
30,very good exept elevator,"the lobby is beautiful and has a stunning view over the interior part of the tower. reception staff and porters very kind. conference facilities good and spaces large and well organized. food and beverage really good and rich. wi-fi free of charge everywhere with high speed connection. bedrooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. large and design bathrooms. no tissues. breakfast rich and good with Nespresso and many kinds of foods. top floor restaurant (evo) has a max capacity of 50, very cosy and  elegant, 360¬∞ view. the 4th floor restaurant is nice, kind staff and good food. free of charge shuttle from hotel to downtown (only one way). the hotel is located nearby the metro station. 10 mins from airport and 15 mins from the city center. the only black mark was the elevators that are 4 but apparently are not organized by a smart system. it takes many minutes to reach the floors from ground and vice versa.",4,2011,11,08
30,Great!,"Managed to get a deal through lastminute.com, so I'm not sure what the price is like otherwise, but my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed our stay. We read up on reviews beforehand and I, as usual, got a little panicky after reading a few negative ones, but the whole thing was brilliant. We were only staying for a weekend so using public transport was ideal, with the station located so nearby it's really not a problem to get into central town, and the lovely people on reception made us feel very welcome. As I don't tend to go on holiday to sit in a hotel, I didn't experience the spa or restaurant, but the room was clean, nicely decorated and had the most exciting shower system I've ever experienced. Three different settings!!",4,2011,10,31
30,"Friendly helpful trustworthy staff. Good for a 3 star hotel,","Going back to same hotel in couple of years, well worth going to if you want customer satisfaction ",4,2011,10,28
30,Nice business but not to find out about Barcelona,"Great conference hotel with many rooms of different size, good service and very good food. Not really a place I would have like to live in to discover Barcelona. The surroundings were not interesting, and Barcelona town at 15 to 20 min by cab.
An why is the gym, in the building, not included in the price?

A plus for their pillow menu! Great sleep.
A gourmet Michelin restaurant on the top floor. But I did not try.
Stupid elevator system but great view from my room on the 15th floor.",3,2011,10,23
30,"Poor location, bad service",Ok hotel but a good 25 min cab ride from centre of town. Views of airport and motorway not great. Business place not for travellers/holiday makers. Severe lack of service when needed despite appearances. ,3,2011,10,12
30,Excellent,"The Hesperia tower hotel is a large modern hotel not far from the airport in the outskirts of Barcelona. My room wasn't ready when I arrived and despite repeated assurances that it would be only 5 minutes, it took at least half an hour before I got my room. Don't know if it was my persistence that got me upgraded or if I was going to get the room anyway, but I ended up with a suite. Great living room and bedroom, huge dressing room and bathroom with a Jacuzzi.
Free wifi internet in rooms and lobby with a username / password login so that you can use multiple devices. Great service, the staff were very helpful and friendly. Unfortunately no iron in the room so I had to pay for an ironing service.
There are only a couple of downsides to the hotel, no pool, although you can join the gym & pool next door for a day, its a long way from the centre of Barcelona, and the worst lift controls I've ever encountered. Unlike normal lifts you need to enter your destination floor on a touch screen panel before you get in the lift. Press the wrong floor, and there is no way to change unless you get out and mess about with a lift control screen while the doors close and the lift you were in disappears elsewhere.",5,2011,10,09
30,Great base,"My wife and i went to Barca on NYE and got a great deal on a room at the Hesperia Tower. It is an amazing hotel with gorgeous rooms - we had a massive bed, separate living room and most importantly huge jacuzzi!! it was only a few stops on the 'tube' to the city centre so although it seems a little far out its not at all!!",5,2011,09,29
30,Excellant 5 Star Hotel between BCN Airport and the City of Barcelona,"Exceptional service was delivered throughout the Hotel by all staff members during my 3 night stay. From check in, to room service, to inclusive breakfast, to housekeeping staff, to the helpfulness of the front desk personnel, everyone associated with the Hesperia Tower Hotel made my brief business stay a memorable experience. Truely a FIVE STAR property!!!
The decor of the room was really perfect for my tastes and the King Sized bed was luxurious. Nicely appointed leather bound bookcase and comfortable sofa for relaxing and desk for working. A few more english language TV channels would have made my stay perfecto!",5,2011,09,26
30,Great Hotel,"Stayed 4 nights at a bargain price. Easy to get to from airport, bus 46 stops outside so don't bother to take airport shuttle. Bit out of the way but worth the trec (20 minutes into city centre) L1, trains every 2 minutes, no where to eat locally. Room was superb, modern design and great view onto Barcelona",5,2011,09,22
30,quite good,"We just came back from our 3 days break in Barcelona. We arrived at the airport around 10 in the morning and waited for more than 1 hour for the shuttle to come, but it wasn't very bad as we still had a lot of time until the check in. Lovely staff and very helpful. When we left for the airport we missed the shuttle, but they advised us to take the bus  46, just accros the road if we've got time, so we don't have to pay 15 euros for a taxi. 

Amazing choices for breakfast, that gets 5 out of 5. 

The room wa very spacious and if you needed to rest it was very quiet and the bad very comfortable and big. We  did noticed the staines on the carpet in the room and hallway but that wasn't much of an incovenient.

We were happy with what we've got for what we've paid, we booked with voiage-prive and breakfast was included, so thumbs up",4,2011,09,21
30,Glad I followed my instincts,"Offered an excellent rate at this hotel which we took advantage of - before reading the reviews!  By this time I was only too happy to cancel but so glad I followed my instints as it was lovely.  We arrived after taking the airport bus as suggested on Tripadvisor.  We did have a harrowing 15 minute walk under the underpass with our luggage at 10pm at night in the rain but believe we could have been dropped closer.  The reception staff were so pleasant and helpful as were concierge,  infact everyone member of staff we met could not have made our stay more pleasant.  The hotel is lovely and very modern with lots of hi-tech, especially the podium from which you call the lift.  The room was a good size with a bathroom that took some getting used to due to the huge amount of mirrors in there but it was super and a great size too.  The bed was comfortable as were the pillows and it was extremely quiet -  no noise from any adjoining rooms at all. Very efficient air conditioning too.

The only reason I have marked this 4/5 was the fact that there were marks on the carpet - lots and the toiletries were in short supply.  We both had a shower upon arrival but this depleted the shower gel and soap we were allocated.  We frothed up the following morning in the shower using shampoo!

Breakfast was plentiful and in a lovely restaurant which was light and bright.  There was so much choice and something to please everyone.  We then took a walk around the block and found a few shops and cafes which are used by the locals.  There is a small supermarket where the prices are excellent and all within 5 minutes walk.  It is by no means picturesque but we felt safe and had excellent public transport plus of course the hotels shuttle bus which we didn't use but did see.

We were about to embark on a cruise so had to take a taxi from the hotel but this cost just 25 euro, add our luggage this made it 31, but so much easier and more pleasurable than jumping on and off buses and walking the rather long bridge to the ships.

I would most certainly recommend this hotel and stay again.",4,2011,09,16
30,Very stylish hotel,"this hotel is not in the best of areas and the transport links are not great, that said the hotel itself is fantastic and the restaurant located in a dome on the top floor is amazing.",5,2011,09,13
30,Impressive,"Very nice hotel.  Tip, there is an ATM machine in the lobby that took our US bank card so that was very handy.  The shuttles ran frequently and were on time.  
It's been a while back but from what I remember, taxi fare from downtown Barcelona back to the hotel costed less than what we expected (I want to say less than 10 euros but I don't remember).
Free wireless internet is available but you need to get a separate code for ALL the devices you want to connect (tablets, laptops, phones, etc).  
Tip:  The elevators are tricky and may require a little bit of a learning curve.",5,2011,09,12
30,Excellent hotel,"I stayed here for one week whilst on business in Barcelona and found the hotel to be up to a high standard. I had also booked this as the secret hotel option on an online booking site. 

The room was of a very high standard - it was also on the 18th floor so I had the most amazing view out over the city. Hotel goes up to floor 29. The room was really spacious and had all the amenities you would expect from a 5* hotel. There was also free wi-fi throughout the hotel - and it worked fine even on my elevated level :-) However, the wi-fi did go down one day - I called reception and they had someone come up and reset the router on my floor which fixed it right away (within 5 minutes it was up and running again) so if that happens and you need internet don't be afraid to say something. 

Gym was of an excellent standard - however if did cost an additional ‚Ç¨12 for one day. It is attached to the hotel but I think it is a gym for common use because it is massive and has excellent facilities. Also a pool and spa so you can work out in the morning before breakfast and then have a jacuzzi at night before bed...if you want to get you full ‚Ç¨12's worth :-)

Breakfast was not included in my room - ‚Ç¨24 a day or ‚Ç¨15 a day if you pre-book. It was an excellent buffet for me - lots of fruit, cereals and yoghurty things - but the cooked stuff looked a bit manky...just like most hotel buffet's I guess. Also, like all the food in the hotel, it was still quite expensive for what you got. Coffee in the hotel reception was like‚Ç¨5 which is a lot. I think they have cottoned onto the fact that there are no restaurants/cafe's nearby so they have a captive audience. Anyway, this isn't anything out of ordinary from other hotels I have stayed at...just a bit annoying is all. 

Yes the hotel is in Hospital de Bellitge area so you need to take the metro if you plan on going into Barcelona but it is really so easy. It is the red line straight to the centre - anyway use this map http://www.tmb.cat/ca/detall-linia-metro/-/linia/L1 to navigate the subway lines. You can also purchase a 10 trip ticket for like ‚Ç¨8 so it's really cheap as well. I was a woman travelling alone and took the subway at 9:30 pm Saturday night when it was dark and it was just fine - fair amount of people about so it felt fairly safe.  

I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2011,09,12
30,"Amazing hotel, location a let down","Just came back from a 5 day holiday in Barcelona. Must say that the hotel absolutely lived up to the expectations, polite staff beautiful lobby, gorgeous room. We had booked a standard room and had planned to upgrade upon arrival as I thought standard room might have been of a very low standard, but then I had a look at the room and I was most def shocked, it was large and filled with loads of plush facilities. Needless to say I decided to save my money from upgrading!! The breakfast buffee was good, better than average but no change throughout the week. Now the only downside with the hotel is it's location, it takes 20-25min in to the city centre and in the heat you might find the metro journey quiet painful but I don't think the hotel itself deserves a poor rating because of the location, i would highly advice a stay at hesperia tower!",5,2011,09,09
30,we love it and we will be back,Lovely hotel and staff. Location is very ideal as metro is about 3-5 minutes walk. We found our way around the sites very easy. Near the airport which is a bonus. Just a downside is some staff  don't speak or understand English. Bar tender manager  & Breakfast team very good. Our sept 1 dinner was excellent the staff in charge that time was very accomodating & helpful. Will definitely come back  & recommend the hotel to friends & family.  Thank You!!!,4,2011,09,06
30,A Brilliant stay,"We stayed at the Hesperia Tower for three nights at the end of august,we found the staff very friendly and helpful, the room was one of the best we have stayed in, breakfast was nice and plenty to choose from,although the hotel is on the outskirts of the city it was easy to get in to the centre and all over the city via the metro system which was just over the road from the hotel. There are a coulpe of local bars a short walk away from the back of the hotel and the drinks are a lot cheaper too. Barcelona it self is a fantastic place, we cant wait to go back, there is so much to see and do, overall a Brilliant stay.",4,2011,09,06
30,Outstanding Views,"Stayed in an Executive Room on 23d floor with access to their very well designed Tower Club for complimentary drinks and snacks all day long. Room was on the small side but very stylish, bed and sofa were incredibly comfortable, night views towards BCN were outstanding, bathroom with black marble and huge shower was great, soundproof excellent and the service very attentive. 
Minor concerns on size of the safe (too small for our laptop), very high costs for any order from room service and location that is probably not suitable for first time visitors who may enjoy feeling closer to where the action really is.",4,2011,09,04
30,loved it!!!!!,"i have read many reviews about this hotel saying it too far out of the city. If your wanting to explore the city by day and relax in the evening this is a perfect place. Metro and bus stop on your door (red line metro) direct train to catalunya 15/20min journey as lots of stops. We used a 10 trip metro pass cost 8euros bargain! Fantastic hotel the best i have ever stayed in for the money. Very good nights sleep in the ""over sized"" bed, excellent bathroom facility's, breath taking views that you cant take your eyes off.",5,2011,09,03
30,"I simply love this hotel, and nothing can change my mind!","This hotel is great! It is very modern, rooms and bathrooms are very spacious and extremely clean! I have stayed in the 24th floor and had an amazing view on the whole city. The staff is extremely helpfull! For smokers, you cannot find anywhere in the hotel a smoking place to enjoy a coffee or a drink, except the room. There is free wifi in the room, the have an internet corner where you can check your e-mail or print something important. What really impressed me where the receptionist(all) and the bellboys, this guys are amazing and the make you feel like home! I would definetely come back with pleasure to this hotel!
There are some free busses, to and from the airport, to Gava Beach and back, and also to Placa Catalunia. The breakfast covers all the demands!",5,2011,09,02
30,Beautiful hotel bit expensive to eat.,A stunning hotel eating in was very expensive. Great location for quick access to the centre of Barcelona . Great trip real luxury.,4,2011,09,02
30,top of the world,"Hesperia Tower is a hi-tech monolith of glass and marble that rises out from the residential/commercial L'Hospitalet region about 4km from the airport.  So technically, Hesperia Tower could be called an airport hotel.  That tag, and any ideas about the area it's situated ends there though.

As soon as you walk through the main doors to the hotel you know you're somewhere special.  Excellent, attentive and multi-lingual service from the staff and everything about the place is high spec.  The lift system is a little over-complicated but you get the hang of it but it's a little thrill in itself hurtling towards the sky in the outside facing elevator.

The rooms are opulent, decadent, high tech paradises.  Every room gives a breathtaking view of the west Barca skyline, the sunsets from our room were ace.  Huge HD TV including BBC, push button automatic curtains, beautifully appointed bathrooms with all mod cons and a wonderful high power vertical shower (if you prefer) to soak away the aches and pains from a day exploring the wonders of Barcelona.

There's a little complimentary shuttle bus to the airport and town if you get there early enough (only 16 seats) or the cheap and easy Metro entrance is 5 mins across the road.  The top restaurant was closed during our stay (it rotates and is a bit of a jewel in the crown) which was a little disappointing but we ate breakfast on the 4th floor restaurant one morning and found the buffet style mix of everything you could possibly want good value for 15 Euros each.

All in all, a perfect base for exploring Barcelona and well worth a visit.  One of the finest hotels I've ever stayed in.",5,2011,08,28
30,"Hotel nice, pity the location ...","Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. Hotel rooms are very nice clean, soundproofed and comfortable with air condition, we had a room with lovely view of the city at the horizon. Breakfast expensive 25 EURO per person. No coffee machine in the room, no robe no slippers (for 5* this should be essentials). Staff of the hotel polite. The location of this hotel is terrible. 20 minutes from Placa Catalunya it's ok by metro but the hotel is built near ugly and filthy residential area. There are no restaurants around just 2 not very nice local filthy pubs in residential area, small coffee shop area and tiny supermarket. If you want to go to the airport you can take bus no 46 from the bus stop located next to the petrol station in front of the motorway it's only 1,45 EURO per person. Hotel provide Airport shuttle as well but it's not regular something just like 5 times a day. Shuttle bus is only for 13 people you can't book your seat in advance so if there is no space in the bus no idea what will happen then ...",3,2011,08,27
30,Great stay to end our vacation,"We stayed at the Hesperia Tower for the last two nights of our 3 1/2 week vacation. We arrived by metro from the Barcelona train station. The trip is very easy to make, and as soon as you walk outside the metro station you'll see the hotel -- no worries about getting lost! 

When we checked in, the front desk clerk asked us if we wanted to upgrade for 60 Euros to a ""'duplex"" suite on the 25th floor. I didn't think it would be worth it, but my husband wanted to check out the room first, and after seeing it, we decided to upgrade. With the original Travelzoo deal I had found plus the upgrade we paid 130 euro per night.

Our room was two stories and had a jacuzzi tub overlooking the industrial/shipyard complex of Barcelona. (Okay, so that doesn't sound too wonderful, but at night the lights twinkle and it's beautiful anyway!). I think we could also see the Segrada Familia from our room also. The downstairs had a nice sitting area with two chaise lounges and a huge TV, as well as a desk and a toilet, and upstairs was the bed, another huge tv, the jacuzzi tub, shower, and toilet. They had multiple kinds and sizes of bathrobes hanging in the closet, and the bath amenities were Bulgari.

The room upgrade enabled us access to the Tower club lounge, which we used extensively. The Tower Club had tapas in the evening, along with bar snacks and pastries in the afternoon. There were drinks, including cava, wine, a variety of beers and liquors, coffee and tea. I think we got our money's worth in the upgrade on the Tower club alone.

The room upgrade also allowed us to take the hotel's shuttle to Gava Beach, which was beautiful. Be prepared with lots of sunblock and money for a taxi if you go, though. The shuttle was a tight fit on the way back, and they only make two runs from the hotel in the morning, and two runs back from the beach in the afternoon. If you miss the return or get sunburned and want to leave early, you'll need about 50 euro to take a taxi, I think we were told.

And breakfast was delicious! Almost anything you could want was there. There  was so much fresh fruit -- including kiwi halves, orange, grapefruit and pineapple slices, whole strawberries, etc. Tons of cheeses, including soft goat cheeses with honey and nuts. There was a yogurt and granola bar with bowls of things like dried goji berries, macadamia nuts, and wheat germ to add in. There was also the giant bread bar with croissants, chocolate croissants, buns, and sliced bread if you wanted. You can be as healthy as you want, or not.

We thought it was great!",5,2011,08,27
30,long weekend to barcelona,"great hotel, breakfast 15 euro plus tax if you book the night before, expensive but buffet so you could eat as much as you liked, cooked english, meats, cereals, fruit, loads.  Bar expensive so pop around the back of the hotels, too little spanish bars there, nice coffee and cheap.  Not very good for barcelona as good half hour on the tube, subway, and this finished about 12 oclock.  Read some reviews about the staff not friendly, we found them all very friendly. Rooms great but to be expected as a five staff hotel.
Free bus service not very frequent, never got to use it, we had to buy tube bus passes 21 euros for 4 days",4,2011,08,24
30,Amazing Breakfast! Cool Rooms!,"We ended up being put up at the Hesperia Tower by our cruise company when a cancelled flight led to us missing our cruiseship. We had been on the go with barely any sleep and no luggage for 2 days when we arrived at the hotel after midnight.

The front desk staff were still receiving our information as we arrived and were incredibly kind and helpful as they sorted out our situation.

Our room was very cool with remote control blinds and moodlights, steam shower and luxurious everything!

The breakfast buffet the next morning was one of the best I've had ever! The room itself is gorgeous with amazing views. The selection of food was incredible and everything was so fresh and tasty. I felt like a celebrity with all my needs met before I even realized them.

The location seemed strange in an industrial area between the city and the airport. We were headed straight back to the airport so it was fine for us but I can't imagine it would be very convenient for visiting attractions in Barcelona?

If you want to be pampered and live like a celebrity for the night, I highly recommend this hotel :)",5,2011,08,19
30,Great week,"The hotel is great. The staff is welcoming, helpfull and polite. Everyone speaks good English and are friendly. The rooms have a luxurious feel to them. We had one on the 11th floor with a great view of the city. As We ordered through an online booking site We didn't have to pay that much for it either; approximately 30 Euros per night for two people. The cons: 
- breakfast or dinner not included. However a caf√© called 365‚Ä¢, in the area behind the hotel had great bocadillas/baguetts, croissants and more + great coffee for a Good price. Also in the summer months the restaurant on the second floor had a great buffet for 25euros per person, which was worth it. We ate here our last night and it was the first meal of the week which had veggies in it(doesn't seem to be a lot of it in Barcelonian restaurants).
- the hotel is at the edge of the city. With the metro it took us around 25-30 minutes to the centre (catalunya), close to La Rambla. On the bright side it left every fifth minute. Reccommend the hotel if you want to stay in a quiet area. Also it's only five kilometres from the AirPort and the hotel has a shuttle for free for all guests both too and from.

30,Decent hotel for the money we spent.,"We booked this hotel for the night that we debarked our cruise to stay at for 1 night prior to flying out of Barcelona.  The hotel was nice, very fancy rooms, very modern and clean.  We booked through hotwire and got a great deal for our 1 night stay.  The location is good as it is closer to the airport and is a short walk to the subway to bring you to anywhere in Barcelona that you'd like to go.  On the bad side we were kind of annoyed that the shuttle they offer to get to the airport does not start until 8am.  Flying to the U.S. We flew out on a 6am flight and had to take a taxi-- the point that annoyed us was they instructed us that it'd be a 20‚Ç¨ cab ride that ended up costing us 38‚Ç¨.  Also, the drinks and food at the lobby bar were extremely overpriced and weren't really that good.  Otherwise, the hotel was a great place to relax comfortably with many ammenities (including free wireless) to keep you happy.",4,2011,08,12
30,"Immaculate, modern - would return again","I am a New Yorker who has travelled for business and pleasure extensively. I require a hotel that is very clean, modern, stylish, safe. I don't want to fear bed bugs, dirtiness or poor service. As a result, I am usually limited to 5 star and very expensive accomodations. I was able to get booked into Hesperia Tower through Expedia at a good rate - small discount from normal prices, because I booked last minute.

The hotel is NOT in a good location. It's quite off the center of the town - especially for a first time Barcelona visitor. The only plus to that is the hotel is chic, clean, upscale and truly 4-5 stars. The other plus is the hotel has a shuttle bus - free service to/from the airport, and to the center of the city. Beware - it is not on demand service, so check the schedule. Otherwise the hotel ia a 20-30 minute train ride or take a cab for about 10-15 euro. I took the train, it was safe, albeit not very busy/populated. 

The hotel is indeed very clean, modern, stylish and safe... There is also free in-room internet. Even though this hotel lists itself as 4-5 stars, if you check out the other 4-5 star hotels, like Hotel Arts Barcelona or the W Barcelona, you'll note quite the difference, but I would still go back to this hotel.

The rooms are very modern and chic. Mirrors in bath area. Rooms are very nicely designed and have a luxurious feel. The negatives are that the gym isn't exactly in the building, you have to walk around the corner to a connected building. And it is not free. The spa is in the same location, I tried to book a massage but they had no appointments. So, book in advance if you plan to have a spa treatment.",4,2011,08,12
30,Good hotel just too far from the centre,"We went to this hotel as part of the secret hotels deal on lastminute.com. Whilst it was a very nice hotel with excellent rooms and public areas it has two main drawbacks. 

Firstly, it is quite a distance from the main city centre. If you have a fair amount of time to spend exploring this is fine, however if like us you have a limited amount of time it can soon eat into your time. There is a free shuttle service to the city centre but there are limited spaces and it will not take you back on the return journey. A taxi ride is about 10 euros which can soon add up.

Secondly, room only means just that. Everything else is fairly pricey. Breakfast is 24 euros unless you book the night before when it will cost you 15 euros. It is a buffet which whilst nice is very overpriced even at the discount rate. The drinks and food at the bars and restaurants are also on the pricey side.

If you have the money and you have unlimited time this will prove to be a lovely hotel for you. If not try and get something closer to the city centre.",4,2011,08,10
30,Loved this hotel!!! Great for a short stay!,"Me and my husband decided to pick this hotel based because of the free shuttle it provided to and from the airport and because found a room at a discounted price. It is a bit far from the city but there is a metro not too far away which takes you to the city in about 30 minutes. We arrived at the hotel earlier than check-in time and the front desk receptionist was nice enough to check us in 2 hours earlier. I felt very comfortable staying at this hotel. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because the complimentary wifi service is kind of sketchy. Our first day there, it worked perfectly fine, but for the next two days it would not work so well. Another negative is the limited space that is on the shuttle bus. There were only 16 seats available, so if you wanted to take the shuttle somewhere, you would have to make sure you arrived early, since its based on a first come first serve basis. Overall, I loved this hotel and wouldn't mind staying here again. The staff were very nice and helpful and the rooms were clean and modern.",4,2011,08,08
30,"We loved it, perfect for couples","I booked this trip as a surprise for my partner from Last Minute.com, and we were not at all dissapointed. As a gay couple were made to feel welcome by the staff, who didnt even blink when we requested a king room rather than a twin, so top marks for that. Yes, the hotel is not in the centre of the city, but the proximity to the metro meant we were on the tube and on the way into the city within minutes from leaving the hotel, very conveinient. The rooms are large, clean and very well presented. The bathroom area is stunning and the hydroshower is a joy after a long day walking round the city. We didnt eat at the restuarant or use any of the leisure facilities so cannot comment on them, but we can happily recommend this hotel for a quality room.",5,2011,08,04
30,Orgasmic experience,"Stayed here as part of a secret hotel deal through Last Minute. Not centrally located but  a regular free shuttle bus runs from hotel to Ramblas (15 mins) there is also a metro station 100 yards away from Reception ( 1 euro per journey). Hotel also provides free shuttle to and from airport

Had a fantastic view of city overlooking Olympic Stadium. Room was spacious with fantastic bathroom and shower. Room included TV, Ipod docking station, mini bar and sofa.

Check out the amazing roof top restaurant, Evo, with amazing food and great nightime views over the city. Although expensive its a memorable and worthwhile experience.

Would definitely go back if in Barcelona",5,2011,08,04
30,"Nice, but with its limits","I stayed there for a 2-day business conference. I would rate it a 4-star hotel rather than 5-star. 
Positive: My room was nice and spacy, fitted with very comfortable bed and pillows, free Wireless and a super bathroom. 
However, the quality of food wasn't worth the price, plus, some of the staff seemed a bit ""overstressed"". Also, the elevator system wasn't practical. Lots of people (incl. me) were standing in front of it, trying to figure out how to get to their floors. 
General impression of the area: For grocery shopping (water, biscuits etc.), I found myself a cheap supermarket located within the area (around 5-min. walk). The location itself isn't attractive (rather industrial, view onto some port companies). 
Transportation: The hotel offers a shuttle to and from Barcelona airport, however, don't rely on a constant schedule. Best is to be in touch with the reception prior to your arrival and ask them to send you a time schedule in order for you to plan on rather taking a taxi, should you arrive after 11AM. Also, I recommend to order a taxi well in advance, should you have a very early flight home (which I had). It took the receptionist at least 15 min. to call me a taxi at 4AM. Should you want to go to the city center - there is a metro not far away that takes you to the city. 
All in all: I am not sure whether I'd choose this place again, unless in need for a hotel close to the airport.",3,2011,08,02
30,Towering Inferno for Customer Service,"This is NOT a 5 star hotel by any normal standards! Customer service was so consistently apalling that my irritation had turned to laughter and amazement by the end of our 4 night stay. This is clearly a hotel focused primarily on business travellers, all other guests beware!

My wife and I got a reduced rate through lastminute.com and thought we would give the hotel a try even though its location wasn't ideal. The staff are very clearly aware of reduced rate customers, and make every effort to make plain their disgust when dealing with even the most meek and reasonable questions / requests. A particular highlight for us was having elevator doors more or less slammed in our face by a member of staff when we asked him to hold the lift as we were rushing to a wedding (reason for our stay). He didn't even bother to try and remotely disguise his lack of effort, and I'm sure I caught a glimpse of a smug sneer as the doors squeezed shut.

Breakfast was also incredibly disappointing and nowhere near the supposedly ""5 star"" standard you would expect. Having now read other reviews, it seems obvious that they provide a substandard breakfast when reduced rate customers are staying. All the fruit was tinned, most of the cooked food was greasy and barely warm, there was a very limited selection of pastrys / bread etc with barley any jam or condiments available, and the coffee was very limited too.

Any extras are incredibly expensive, and the spa / gym is not included despite how it may appear. We weren't even provided with any free bottled water, which I would normally expect from a 5 star hotel. Leaving us to have to pay over 3 euros for a tiny bottle of water as there were no supermarkets anywhere nearby. Our phones in our room didn't work, which meant that we had to go down to reception to order anything, which gave them ample opportunity to be rude to us and make us feel wholly unwelcome. Apparently our phones couldn't be fixed over the weekend, as the technician wouldn't be available till Monday (when we left).

The only reason I have given this hotel 2 points instead of 1 is the views and the quality of room, which were generally good, even if we were looking out over the airport and motorway (probably because we were reduced rate customers too!).",2,2011,08,01
30,Nice but not a 5 stars level,"For rooms we would propose a general 5 stars compliment to guests:e.j. Free tea and coffee or at least a small kattle. The welcoming was quite cold and we felt as if there was thousands people in the queue since the girl was quite fast and didn't pay attention (didn't speak the breakfast, spa, fitness). Check out was quite friendly and the new girl took in consideration our opinion and if we were happy. Wifi didn't work for 2 days. Location is quite far from services and city center but there is the underground just in front of the hotel which is convenient. Also we discovered just before departure thay shuttles exist for city center and beach (no information at the check in or in the room as normally). In general let's say that the quality of the hotel is nice but that service should be really improved to reach a 5 stars level of service.",4,2011,07,31
30,"Great value, five star hotel","A fantastic hotel! Okay, so it's a way out of the city but that's okay if you want to sight see and you're not bothered about staying out into the early hours.
The metro stop is at the end of the red line and is literally a 2 or 3 minute walk. The red line is probably the most ideal line it could be situated on, stopping at espanya, universitat, and catalunya and to be honest, segrada la familia isn't at all difficult to get to either. Buy the 10 journey travel tickets.

The hotel is very over priced for drinks and food, however I think that the hotel aims their prices at their business audience as the hotel is a business conference centre too.
However there is a supermarket around the corner behind the hotel, where you can buy 1.5 litre bottle of water for 50 cents - better than anywhere in the city!!

If you want a beach day, as we did head to Sitges, rather than the Barcelona beach which is man made and horrendously busy! The hotel was very helpful directing us their as we'd missed the shuttle bus which the hotel runs to there.

Overall a great hotel, really high spec rooms, very comfortable, fantasic views - whichever aspect you're facing! And really friendly staff.

We booked through lastminute.com and I would certainly return!",5,2011,07,29
30,"Gorgeous, modern hotel but not convenient to La Ramblas or attractions","The architecture is stunning.  The restaurants are fabulous. The rooms are way cool.... but the location is completely lacking.  There is literally NOTHING you can walk to from this location but if you are looking for a place to sleep and eat well, you will love it.",5,2011,07,28
30,"Very Nice, Good Value","We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and were very happy with the room. Very clean, good service. The bathroom was very nice and well equipped. The bed was firm but comfortable. This was a much nicer room than our stay at the Sofitel Bayern Hotel in Munich, Germany, which was more expensive. The hotel is about a 30 minute Metro ride to the city center, but we actually enjoyed being a bit out of the center of things and did not mind the train ride. The Metro is just across the street and trains arrive every 3 minutes, so you never have to wait. The staff was attentive every time we asked for anything and we would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,07,28
30,Great tower in Barcelona,"We stay 2 nights at the Hesperia Tower as our base to visit the city. Located near the tube within 15minutes to the city centre. Quiet place. The hotel has a good view of Barca, Our room was spacious and modern design. Staff was polite and courteous. We visit the top of the tower to see barca at night, very nice circular restaurant really.Breakfast and food price very expensive. Will use it again at a base to visit the city but not to eat there, plenty of tapas place in town.",4,2011,07,28
30,"5 Star hotel, 2 star welcome","We arrived at the hotel car park and went to reception.  Our first experience of the hotel was the receptionist telling us we would have to pay 24 Euros a night to park in the hotel! Even for a Blue badge holder we enquired?  The answer was yes and we would have to park in the street!  We did so and went back and checked in.  We had booked a smoking room and this was confirmed by the receptionist.  The room was deluxe, mirrored bathroom, bathrobes and an excellent view over the hospital and mountains.  We could not find an astray, so my partner went to reception.  A different person saw him and was rude to him.  He said it was our fault we were in a non-smoking room!  So we changed to a smoking room.  The view was the same, but the quality of the room was not.  The shower leaked, there were stains on the bedroom area carpet and a cracked tile in the WC.  The reception staff had made us feel not welcome and it put me off straight away.  We were at this hotel because of a good deal with a well known travel web site; we feel we were treated differently because of this.  On check in we were given no information, so it was down there again to find out where we were supposed to go for breakfast.  Breakfast was great on the first morning, a real 5 star affair.  Second morning, more people arrived, and all had changed!  Gone was the deluxe coffee machine, the meat selection was limited, the lovely range of pastries was suddenly very limited, gone were the fried eggs to be replaced by watery scrambled eggs.  Gone were the packet cereals and the fancy jams.  The tables which had been beautifully dressed were now plain and functional.  They had down graded breakfast for the reduced price guests!  The location of this hotel is on the outskirts, amongst the hospital and a residential area.  Only a couple of bars and a snack place (.365), no where for a decent meal, just snacks,  The hotel is the last stop on the metro.  This is more the hotel for the business person.  The doorman and the staff for breakfast were good, but the most important staff, the one you first meet, really let us down.   At the end of the day, we had a lovely view from our room but the unwelcoming reception staff made us feel uncomfortable, for that reason we would not go back to this hotel.",2,2011,07,27
30,Short stays for business travellers ONLY.,"Bad location for tourists, wifi works very occasionally (and by that I mean it's down for a day at a time) complained twice about a couple of things and no one ever got back to be despite chasing them. The expensive breakfasts are shockingly bad and room service sometimes just don't bother to deliver your order! This is not a 5* hotel by any stretch of the imagination.

Tips: google cafe 365 which is very close to the hotel and do good sandwiches, there is NOTHING else worth going to around the hotel.

Metro is easy to use so jump on that and go into town, when card in wait for the barrier to 'clunk' before you try and go through. ",3,2011,07,24
30,Nice hotel but a bit expensive for me im afraid :-(,"Stayed at this sky scraper hotel for a long weekend in Barcelona, booked it as a secret room so didnt pay much for this hotel. The food was not of the best quality - one evening we had a buffet meal but i was very ill the next day. The hotel its self is very fancy but is a bit far out from barcelona city centre. There is a tram system nearby but it must have taken us over 40 mins to get into barcelona.",3,2011,07,18
30,Nice hotel - 30 min Metro journey from the centre,"Nice hotel, however if we were to visit Barcelona again we would choose a more centrally located hotel, with a free pool, that included breakfast.

Booked a late deal through lastminute.com - this didnt include breakfast. So on arrival we were informed that we could have breakfast for an extra ‚Ç¨25 per person, but if we 'pre-booked' the day before we could have it for the bargain price of ‚Ç¨15!! Funnily enough we didnt have breakfast in the hotel, and instead travelled into town and found a cafe each day for breakfast. 

As mentioned in previous reviews the hotel is about 30 min from the centre of Barcelona by Metro. The Metro is easy to use with an 'English' button on the ticket machine. Initially we purchased a '10 single journey' ticket, but for the last 2 days we purchased a 2 day ticket with unlmited travel on metro, funicular, train, including the train to the airport. 

The hotel is very expensive for drinks, food etc etc. As it is primarily a 'business' / 'conference' hotel - I can only presume people pay these prices and then claim them back on company expenses.

If, we were to visit Barcelona again we would stay in a more centrally located hotel which included breakfast and the pool in the price.",4,2011,07,16
30,It was a luxurious stay,"Me and a friend stayed here for a 4 night city break. We got a good deal which included an upgrade to a deluxe room and complimentary breakfast each day. I was a little sceptical booking but I cannot fault this hotel. Beautiful interior, friendly staff, an amazing room with a fab bathroom area and an amazing view of the city- we could see the sagrada familia from our room! Breakfast was gorg- there was full english option (cooked breakfast), all cereals, delicious waffles with chocolate sauce and maple syrup, fruits, ham + cheeses ( we made sandwiches one day and ate them in parc guell) and various juices,tea + coffee. The hotel is not in a bad location, contrary to previous reviews, it is across the road from the metro which will take you anywhere- no fuss, cheap and very easy to understand the map. We took taxis home every night as we stayed out very late- top price we were charged from the city centre was 18euros, but generally cost 12-15euros...not exactly pricey. I'd recommend this hotel because you feel like a celeb wondering round this beautiful hotel, we ordered room service and ok, although that is pricey- we managed to wangle a free pizza AND chips with our order- and it came on the cutest wheely tray and silver wear.
I'll stay here again- especially if anymore deals pop up!",5,2011,07,14
30,"Excellent hotel, check out the spa if you stay","The hotel is lovely. Our room was really big with a very comfortable bed and really nice bathroom with an awesome shower. The breakfast was really nice, lots of fresh food and healthy options as well as the traditional breakfast options. The location is a bit out of town but we didn't mind as it wss about 100 metres to the tube which was really fast and cheap and ran all night. And was air-conditioned so not a problem to get into town. We really enjoyed having a beer in the bar before / after going out and even better was the spa. We loved spending our last day in the spa and would recommend it as a way to unwind before flying home.",5,2011,07,12
30,17th floor heaven!,"Stayed here for 5 nights .Arrived by bus from airport (a short trip) at 11.50 a.m. and a very pleasant receptionist found us a room straight away (17th. floor) , great views overlooking hospital grounds and the distant airport . Great room, very quiet and clean, bathroom fantastic, large shower cubicle with multiple jets, separate large toilet room  and lots of drawers and wardrobe space. Lift system brill. Breakfast was excellent with an amazing choice of dishes, even various choices of tea and coffee and staff very pleasant and helpful. Tip- take your own kettle,tea and coffee, we sat on the settee late at night drinking ours and enjoying the amazing night sights.
Used the metro system , very convenient, speedy and felt very safe. Used the hotel shuttle to the airport. 
We had a really enjoyable stay and would recommend it to others.",5,2011,07,05
30,Not a 5 star hotel,"Not sure how this hotel received a 5 star rating, more like a 3 star.  The customer service is horrible.  It's a like an a la carte hotel.  The pool is not free nor is the gym.  If you want to use them you have to pay extra each day.

Worse, you have to pay $5 for a bucket of ice because there are no ice machines on each floor.  Or you can go the lobby and get your ice pocket filled which is only holds enough ice for two cups.  Which means you are going up an down an awful lot.

The phone has a button marked room service but it doesn't work for room service.  You have to dial some other number and service takes at least 20 minutes for delivery even for something as small as a pot of coffee.  Of course, you have to specify to bring cream and sugar ... or coffee is all you get.

Trying to get help at the front desk to rent a car was a nightmare.  It took the front desk person at least 5 phone calls which could have been handled in one call had they simply listened to what we were asking.  

Since this hotel is more like a 3-star, it's not worth the money.  Better of picking a 3-star and paying less money for about the same poor quality service. 

I would not recommend this hotel.",3,2011,07,03
30,Nice hotel but lacks in certain areas.,"I was a bit worried about this hotel after reading previous guest reviews, but overall we had a great stay. When we arrived late morning and asked if we could check in, it was quite funny when we were told our room wasn't ready, but we could have a junior suite for 40euros extra per night. we didn't intend on spending a lot of time at the hotel, so we declined and was told that our room therefore wouldn't be ready until 3pm! We left our luggage and took the hotels free shuttle into the city. This was a great service, but make sure you are there in plenty of time as if the shuttle is full anyone not having a seat doesn't travel. We found out from another guest that there was a metro station just 2 minutes walk away, which we found to be excellent and a ticket of 10 journeys cost under 8euros. We had a slight problem when checking out in that there was something from the mini bar on our bill which we hadn't had - we had planned to take the hotel shuttle to the beach, but the reception girl took so long to sort it out, we missed the shuttle and the staffs apologies were very insincere. They did take the item off the bill, but we then had to re think our day. Our rate included breakfast, which was excellent as was the service in that particular restaurant. The variety at this hot and cold buffet was huge. If visiting Barcelona again, I would probably choose a more central city hotel, just for the convenience. It is a shame that the hotel seemed to be a bit money grabbing as the pool wasn't included if you were 'just in a deluxe room' and everything else just seemed a bit begrudging. The reception staff could have been a little more informative about the services in the area, like telling us about the metro etc. We had a room on the 19th floor and had great views, but the carpet had stains on it and there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.",4,2011,07,02
30,Wonderful hotel but  ridiculous prices at bar on top of tower,We stayed at this hotel on our final night in Barcelona after a two week trip. The rooms  were excellent - comfortable beds - and very clean. Great views of the city from hotel room.    The reception staff was wonderfully helpful in answering all of our questions.  The free shuttle to the airport worked as pomised with our first departure at 7 am - 10 minute ride to T1 at airport.  Only negative was the bar and restaurant on top of the hotel. Poor service combined with prices that  were ridiculously expensive.  Stay out of there!,5,2011,06,29
30,5 stars? No way!!,"I'm from Barcelona so I know my way around the city that's why the location of this hotel did not worry me at all. It's a bit far out from the centre but in reality it's just an extra 20 min tube ride. ¬†Got a junior suite for 50 euros extra per nigth on top of the room rate which we already had paid. ¬†We were offered that promotion whilst checking in. The reception staff were ok but nothing extraordinary which considering they rate themselves 5 starts I would expect a much ¬†higher level and standard of customer service - which they definitely don't provide. Crazy prices, 10 euros for an expresso and a large bottle of water at the ground floor bar?? 24 euros for breakfast?? Madness!! ¬†Our fridge stopped working on the last day so we called the room service to ask for some ¬†ice and were told we will be charge for the service othervise we could always go to the ground floor bar and get it ourselves for free. What a joke!! For a relative new hotel things are falling apart quite rapidly in the room. We found: Stained carpets, cracked wood door frames, shower screen not sealed properly so water went everywhere when showering and few other bits. On a positive note the impressive big windows do provide a nice view of the city if you are facing the right way. We also used their shuttle bus service to the airport and it was great. We were the only people in the bus and the lady driver left us outside terminal C. That was very sweet of her. The bus service stops on terminal 1. I will use this hotel again as long as the room rate is adequate and reasonable for a 4 (not 5) star hotel in the suburbs.¬†",3,2011,06,22
30,a little too over the top,"We booked one night in this hotel because of its proximity to the airport -- that was great and made for a very easy cab ride to El Prat (note, you don't save $ on taxi b/c of the minimum charge). The hotel is very nice, super modern, but in a location that is a bit out of the way. It's easy to take the metro into the city so that's nice. Just a quick walk across the street. Our room had what seemed like too many gadgets with all the light switches and all the controls triggered by the key card. Elevators are really modern and computerized in the elevator lobby -- punch in your floor on the computer to call the elevator. Our bed was actually two twins pushed together -- a little weird. We did sleep well and had an early flight so the location was helpful to us.  Knowing the architect is Richard Rogers explains some of the things that were less than functional about the room. It's cool -- almost a little too cool with space not used super well. But it served the purpose and we still got into the city that evening to have dinner at the marina.",4,2011,06,18
30,Nice but pricey,"Stayed here for a convention so I had no choice about the location.  The hotel is lovely.  The rooms are nice, but Brits beware - no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms and the hotel bar charges ¬£4 for a pot of tea!!  We took a travel kettle and provided for ourselves.  Breakfast is ¬£24 each and it's only a continental - no cooked option.  There are several pricey restaurants in the hotel.  If you're adventurous, there are a few local bars and a small supermarket located in the residential area next to the hotel.

The hotel is located in an outlying part of the city, close to the airport with lots of blocks of flats around it.  It is a business hotel really - not meant for tourism (hence the prices!!).  

It is close to the end of the red metro line (a 5 min walk) but the hotel provides a shuttle service to the city (note, not from so you have to find your own way back).   The shuttle service also serves Terminal 1 of the airport.  You have to make your own way to Terminal 2 (use the bus service on the bottom level of T1).",4,2011,06,17
30,Recommended Airport Hotel,"We stayed one night in the Hesperia Tower-mainly due to it's location to both the airport and the subway.  The metro stop is across the street from the hotel with frequent trains into the city.  It takes about 30 minutes.  Suprisingly the hotel is really not very close to the airport and they only have shuttles every 40 minutes during the main business hours.  Otherwise a cab costs twenty euros from the airport.  The hotel itself is modern and quite nice.  The room was large with a huge bathroom and excellent shower.  We didn't eat in the hotel, but assume the breakfast buffet must be excellent considering it costs 24 Euros/Person. All in all we were pleased-especially given the low price we were able to find online.",4,2011,06,13
30,BEST BARCELONA HOTEL SO FAR,"We have used this hotel for business and leisure 3 times now and each time it has been the same consistent high standard of room, service and comfort. 
It is greeat when used for airport connection hotel and if you are there to see the city, the free shuttle bus runs regular up to the Placa Catalunya which only takes 10/15 minutes. 
If you drive, there is lots of free parking in the streets around, which is hard to find in Barcelona. We are regular gym users when we travel and the gym next to the hotel (connected) is brilliant, it's a propery health club with huge gym and facilities. It's 12‚Ç¨ per visit but worth it if you are keen to keep up when you are travelling. 
We will always opt for this hotel now when we travel to / from Barcelona.",5,2011,06,13
30,"No 5 Star hotel:  comfortable & pleasant but too expensive, too far away from city center","Hesperia Tower Hotel was clean/attractive/comfortable but internet access (free wifi) was quite poor.  It worked sometimes, but during busy times of day, no access.  Prices for food in the hotel are way too high, for example 4 - 5 euros for a cup of espresso or capuccino, .  We always went out to eat.  
There is nothing around the hotel to make it an attractive location.  If you are able to walk a lot and use the metro (subway) then it can work for you.  The area seems very safe to walk around, jog, etc.  We used the subway for all of our transportation but it requred a 10 minute walk to access the subway.  Definitely not a 5 star hotel, but probably a 4 star.  Staff was helpful.",3,2011,06,12
30,nice hotel with no where to go!,"This hotel had some nice amenities.  The bed was comfortable and large bath.   Enjoyed the buffet breakfast - quite a good selection of items but not cheap.  You were charged 18E if purchased when checked in or 20E in the morning.  However, it was out in the middle of no where .  You could walk down the street to a store and a few businesses - that was it.  Too far to go to LasRamblas.  Did not use the shuttle as we did not want to wait.  Would rather stay in the LasRamblas area.",3,2011,06,10
30,Don't go there,"We're at a loss as to what wound us up most about this hotel. But having just left there, the thing freshest in mind is the downright rude service from the guy on reception who seems to hate tourists.

So: good points first; then all the reasons I'd strongly suggest you avoid this place.

Good:
It's a stylish looking place. That is it.

Bad:
Location. It's not just outside of Barcelona town, but far enough that it costs 15 Euros in a taxi, which adds up to 60 Euros a day plus tips. The part of town it's in is horrendous - the views are of the slum tower blocks all around it and there's nothing nearby except a very deprived urban area.
Cost: it's outrageous. No other word for it. The service and quality in no way go towards justifying the insane prices. 4.5 Euros for a tiny bottle of water, which we were obliged to drink because there are no shops nearby and unlike any other decent hotel, there was no complimentary bottled water for guests; or little details which would have given the illusion of it being a 5 star hotel, like good manners from the staff.
Everything was wrong:
We'd gone for a romantic break. We arrived to find a surly receptionist who told us the room we had booked was not available, so we had the choice of either a twin broom with single beds, or a double smoking room. We foolishly took the double. It STUNK. But then there were no more rooms available. The receptionist, who minutes earlier pretended he couldn't speak English, was by this point engaged in a perfectly fluent English conversation about the football. Literally minutes later, he again pretended he couldn't speak English!  If he hates customers so much, he's really chosen the wrong career, being in a customer-facing job and all.  This isn't written by some arrogant Brit who assumes the world should speak his language, far from it.  We both speak a little Spanish and were doing our best. But when dealing with someone whose job it is to help us, who made it his business to show that he really didn't want to ... Then it really made a difference.

The shower was broken. The television was broken. The hairdryer was broken.

All in all, it's a miracle my partner and I are still together after surviving that long weekend in an absolute pit. 

Don't go there - you'll regret it.",1,2011,06,06
30,Really good hotel,"This is a really good hotel, the view was excellent",5,2011,06,04
30,Dissapointed; may work for others but not for me.,"Little did I know that 5 stars in Barcelona means less than 4 star.  Weird.  I had booked this hotel as a place to relax before taking a flight home from Barcelona to New York after a great honeymoon week in Mallorca.  I knew this place was an airport hotel and not in a sought after area, but there is litterally nothing there.  Given this you would think the hotel would have a plethora of amenities.  Not the case.  When we entered the beautifull room we looked for a list of amenities such as pool, gym, restaurants, other activities etc.  However there was nothing.  I knew there was something strange with the the pool and gym in that you needed to pay to enter them, or if you were a hotel guest you could enter for free, but I was not sure.  Unfortunately there was no information in the room to supply any information about anything.  I went down to the front desk and asked if they had any information about what the hotel had to offer, she replied with yes you should have a small black pamphlet with all of the information you need.  I informed her that I did not believe my room had this pamplet, she then went on to pretty much tell me - oh well, and I am not going to give you another one.  Really??  She told me to look at the elevator map if I had questions.  I then went back to the room and called guest services and asked ""is there a pool and gym in the hotel?"" her response ""yes of course there is a pool/gym in the hotel"", my response ""where?"" her response, ""in the hotel"" (thanks for being utterly useless and sarcastic), my response once again ""where in the hotel?"" her response ""in the back of the first floor"".  My wife and I then put on our bathing costumes and flip flops and trudged through the ornate lobby where everyone is wearing suits and see zero signage for the pool.  I then continue through the lobby down the hallway and now I am in a private party (uncomftorable), we then travel through the party and approach a turnstile which instructs us to buzz for hotel gym access, which we do and are buzzed in accordingly.  We walk through a bustling gym (still no pool), we ask a staff member where the pool is and we are directed through another turnstile to speak to the front desk who inform us that we just need to tell them we are hotel guests and we will receive a towel for pool use.  After standing there for a half hour as the only staff member worked with someone with member service questions we are then told we need to buy a token at the hotel for 12 euro and that we cannot go back to the hotel the way we came and need to go outside through a parking lot and then walk through a grassy knoll (are you serious?)  We then approach the hotel and are greeted by a concerned and very helpfull hotel staff member.  I tell him of my concerns and he first tells me that in Barcelona you cannot expect pool and gym access at a 5 star hotel, as that is 4 star hotel amenities (weird), I asked about the restaurants (3) that are offered, ie what cuisines are served, what are the hours, do I need reservations, what is the dress code etc (as no info is provided anywhere).  He helps me with all of my questions and apologizes for the lack of information.  All of this could have been avoided if they provided any information in the room.  I guess they are too chic for that though.  If this level of service works for you then this hotel is for you.  The only positive things I have to say about the hotel is that the bathroom was great, the food decent, and the service of the doorman at the hotel who helped my with my problems was excellent.  Not to mention their were stains all over the carpets, in the hallways and in the rooms.",2,2011,05,30

30,"AC problem, bigger problem, no adjustment to price.","Would not be writing this as I am a reasonable person and know that things can malfunction. I'm writing because when the AC needed a new motor and we were sleepless the first night do to noise on the street because of the open window, there was no fan to bring to the room and no adjustment made to the cost.  Internet does not work in the rooms. Not a good way to run a business.  Would advise to avoid.",5,2011,05,23
30,evo restaurant,"O.M.G. we were robbed, the place is so cheese and the waiters are bandits, we were four, and the ladies did not want to have appetizers son upon suggestion of the waiter of sharing an appetizer extra for the whole table  we said yes, (turn to be we got 4 appetizer more charge) they keep putting bread and water on the table, ( we found out at the bill every time they did it is was one different charge, so we end up paying bread and water service 5 times.)
when we asked for replacement to the main dishes side they said ""sure we can do that"" so they took the sides out of the plate and served new sides ( charged individually  for each side) they brought dessert complement of the chef, at least they said so when they asked us to order, well we were charge as well for such of complements. The waiter are professional pushing you with drinks and extra food and once we said no no more they totally forgot about us and it take us 30 min to get the bill and a diferent person, a host, i guess came to pick up the payment.
The food is really bad and the whole thing is a show put on the most cheap premises to take as much money from you as they can.
We paid because we have seen our friends from Barcelona in long time so, it was not wortly and argument in front of them, but it has been the worse restaurant nigh ever.
We live in NY, we go to Spice Market, Mono, Budakhan, BudaBar, STK, boat house, thompson hotel restaurats..etc
Never never never go to this Evo restaurant hotel Hesperia, should be ashamed of having it in its location",1,2011,05,23
30,"Decent hotel, location not suitable for tourists","We stayed for 4 nights at the Hesperia Tower with a group of 5 people. We chose this hotel mainly because we thought the shuttle bus would make transportation easier for us, as this was our first trip to Barcelona we didn‚Äôt know how to get around. But at the airport we were told that the shuttle bus would only arrive 2,5 hours later. Unlike other shuttle services which drive every 10 minutes or so, the Hesperia shuttle doesn‚Äôt drive in the afternoon between 12-17 pm. We decided to wait because we wanted to save 50 eur on the taxi fare (25 eur per taxi)
And when the shuttle bus finally arrived at the airport, we had been standing at the bus stand for THREE hours BECAUSE NO ONE TOLD US THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO CALL THE HOTEL TO SEND THE SHUTTLE< EVEN IF IT WAS SCHEDULED. So this was a very disappointing start. 

The hotel itself looks stylish at first, but it‚Äôs the little things that take away the illusion that you are in a five star hotel. For instance the elevator, very annoying in use. The touch screen doesn‚Äôt work properly. Broken handles in the lift. If you want to supply the guests with a panoramic view, then at least make sure the glass window is clean.

The rooms in the hotel were disappointing too if you expect five star. The rooms were very dusty, for people with allergies this is quite troublesome. The furniture were visibly old. The beds were creaking. But the mattress and pillows are comfortable. And so is the shower. I could appreciate the separated toilet, this is very hygienic.

We tried only one restaurant at the hotel. I would definitely not recommend eating at the Bouquet restaurant, it‚Äôs absurdly overpriced. For just one glass of soft drink we paid ‚Ç¨7. Instead I would recommend to go to the little coffee bar on the corner of the Media Markt. There they serve excellent coffee. And you can stock water, soft drinks and other supplies at the supermarket across for very good prices. There is also a bakery next to the supermarket which has good croissants and bread.

The metro is near the hotel, but it takes quite some time if you have to travel back everyday from the city center to the hotel. The location of the hotel is simply not suitable for tourists, although it might be perfect for those who wish to avoid the crowd of the city center.",3,2011,05,07
30,Earlier reviews say it all,"I'll keep this short - location not the best but very close to a stop on Barcelona's amazing metro system so central locations are in easy reach.

Main lobby bar - decent reasonably priced wines  but everything else overpriced and chairs are incredibly uncomfortable.

Restaurants - no idea, never ate there, not least because it was impossble to find out what they served or at what price, other than for the massively over-priced Evo Restaurant (3-star+ michelin prices for a 1-star restaurant)

Staff helpful & very good English spoken

Airport shuttle (inbound) impossible to locate

City shuttle - fine (10 minutes to Playa Catalunya) but as you needed to be there 15 minutes before departure to get a seat, any time saving v Metro was lost

Fantastic rooms, great  views

Never tried the leisure facilities, not least because of the cost which others have noted and which really should be within the room price.

Breakfast extortionate - there is a cafe 2 minutes walk away so go there, or stock up from the supermarket (next to the cafe) - also good for mixers to go with the booze you bought at the airport...didn't you?

Overall - triumph of style over substance BUT fine for a city break and if you know what you want from your stay.  If, like many, you book this on a Lastminute 'Secret Hotel' deal you won't be disappointed, and Barcelona is a great place to visit.",4,2011,05,03
30,"Great Hotel, bad location","If this hotel had been in downtown Barcelona, I would have given it 5 stars across the board!!  Unfortunately, it was a good distance away from all the really cool stuff and ALL services that you would expect to have access to.  We used Hotwire to get these rooms for $79 and $99 a night for a room that would normally cost 349 euro a night!!

The rooms were magnificent!!  Very modern!  Our room was what is known as an apartment but unfortunately these rooms aren't available in the main building but are approx 200 feet away in a separate building.   It was 3 rooms including the bathroom.  It came with mini fridge, 2 top stove, microwave, sink and dishes, sitting area with a mini bar, dinner table, 2 flat screen TV's, safe and massive closets!!  The bathroom was amazing and had a multi-head shower but no washcloths which I found unusual.  There was only a sponge for cleaning yourself in the shower, but I guess this must be a European thing.  

Breakfast was offered through a buffet service and only cost 10 euros which we thought very affordable!  Food was good and the coffee was excellent!!

The hotel offers a free shuttle to the airport and downtown but no service back.  Expect to pay around 20 euros for a cab to get back unless you know how to get there using the subway.  There is subway access close to the hotel (10 min walk) if you are comfortable using it.  If not, be prepared to pay for transportation.

All in all, a very good hotel if you are willing to pay for taxis to get back to the hotel and are willing to not be close to all the hustle and bustle of a very beautiful city",4,2011,05,02
30,Wonderful hotel with stunning views of Barcelona city.,"I stayed for a night at the Hesperia Tower during the Easter Weekend. In arrival we were told that our room was not yet ready and they offered us an upgrade to an exec. room for 50 EUR. We couldn't say no to the offer and went ahead with the upgrade. I'd highly recommend anyone to take the upgrade for this price. It gives you access to the Spa, Tower Club and late check-out next day (5 o'clock). Only for the late check-out I think it is just worthy.

I did not find any problem with the location. 10-15 EUR taxi to city center, 1EUR in the bus, 70cent in Metro or free with the hotel shuttle.

I've not doubt that I'll stay at this hotel every single time I come back to Barcelona. Can't wait to go back now.",5,2011,04,30
30,nice good hotel but service needs major improvements,"Hi
I stayed here with customers during Mobile world congress.
The Hotel is at nice location, and offers a very good view from the rooms.
The food is good and the restaurants are also one of the best.
However the gym is located outside and one has to walk in the cold morning to access it and then a long walk back intot he hotel. The service is very slow and i found the reception staff a bit inflexible and so was there duty manager.
However OK to stay for  business purposes during the conference due to its proximity to the Fira.",5,2011,04,30
30,"Fantastic Hotel, superb service","Just returned from a fantastic holiday in Barcelona, and certainly what added to making the trip fabulous was the stay at this very nice hotel. From arrival (10 min ride for E 1.45 each on bus 46 from the airport) to departure the staff looked after our every need and could not do enough to help. We could see that they were not being ""overly attentive"" just to attract a tip, they were just plainly doing their job - looking after us. The rooms are first class, maintained spotlessly clean and super quality cosmetics of BVLGARI make. The breakfast was included and there was excellent choice. The staff in both the restaurants Azimut and Tower were extremely kind and helpful. You need to have a Ph.D in working the coffee machine, but it did serve the best quality when I got it right. I would highly recommend this place and stay there again.",5,2011,04,27
30,Wonderful Hotel - excellent rooms,"This is a fab Hotel to stay at. We booked through Tesco travel on a top secret location and was not sure once we got the details.  But once we arrived by no. 46 bus which cost like around 6 euros for the 4 off us (2 children 12 & 14) which drops you across the hotel and a short walk (5 mins) you are welcomed at the door and taken to reception.  Very Polite receptionists very helpful as we had two rooms booked and we were early, and check in was not till 1500.  Since I had been emailing them they had sorted one room out for us so we could leave a luggage and freshen up before we went out.  Rooms are excellent as we had two connecting rooms, good views especially in the night (we were on the 15th floor).  Rooms have a mini bar which is expensive and use of bathrobes and towels so no need to take any, also free showers/wash stuff.   
Breakfast is expensive around 20 euro's each so if you go out the main entrance and turn right towards Media Mrkt and the right again pass the water pond and keep walking (5 mins) across the road there is local shops like a supermarket for water and general stuff and a small cafe called 365 which was great for breakfast.  You can get coffee and fresh orange juice and breakfast like toasted sandwich and crossant type things (cash only places though) but its cheaper than most places.   Hotels does a free shuttle to Las Ramblas which takes around 10 - 15 with out traffic so not bad, but don't leave it till the time it leaves to catch it otherwise you may not get on as it only takes around 16 people.  Don't worry as the metro is not far which will take a 20 min ride to Catalayn which is near Las Ramblas.  Had a lovely stay and would stay here again if I get the same deal.  This Hotel is not as far as people make it out to be and you can always find shops near by as long as you are willing to explore a little.",5,2011,04,20
30,great rooms but outside the centre of barcelona,"we stayed at hesperia tower for 4 nights last week. 

Check in - There was a massive queue when we arrived and i thought we would be there for ages. The doorman told us that we would be served very soon and within 5 mins we had checked in and were in our room.

Rooms are very modern and really clean. 'Raindrop' style power shower was great. The room was split into 2 parts, when you came in a 'dressing area' with the shower room and toilet off it. Then through the door to where the bed and TV were. Sounds strange but it worked well. There was a hairdryer and lots of toiletries. Nice view. Bed very comfy and there was a pillow menu. Also a free safe in the room. 

TV had a number of english speaking channels including BBC 1. Mini bar with no space to put your own drinks in. Free Wifi - you get a password when checking in. 

Courtesy bus (free) - this goes from the hotel to placa de catalunya 3/4 times in the morning and a few times at night. It also goes to barcelona airport. You just wait at the front of the hotel for it to turn up. It takes about 15 mins to the centre of BCN. The hotel is also very near to BCN airport. 

Staff - very nice. very helpful. 

We didn't use the bar/restaurant as the hotel was a base for us - out in the morning and back late at night. 

The metro is across the roundabout from the hotel, you cant miss it. The stop is called hospital de bellvitge. We got the T-10 ticket from the machine - 7.95 for 10 journeys. Its on the red line 1 - right at the end. Metro open until 12 on weeknights and later at weekend. It took about 25 mins to get to the centre of town which wasn't really that long.",4,2011,04,16
30,Fantastic hotel - OK location,"We came here on a city break and booked through last minute.com, so got a great deal. We arrived at the airport and got a taxi, knowing that it wasn't that far from the airport. Unfortunately, there was a minimum taxi fare, which more than covered the journey, but we paid it anyway. 

Despite worrying when we arrived that the hotel is on a noisy roundabout, inside the hotel, you can't hear the traffic. The reception is very impressive with an art deco feel. Staff are very friendly and helpful. 

We had a standard room, which was smaller than we expected, but very clean. Bathroom was spectacular with a great shower! 

The location isn't too bad, we were aware that it was a little bit out of the town, but there was a regular bus service into town, which the hotel provide for free. Otherwise we would use the subway, which was as short walk away. Average journey into the centre of the town was about 1/2hour. 

I would recommend this if you don't mind making the journey in and out of the city centre.

But, watch out for the confusing lift buttons...sounds stupid but the fancy computer system  on the ground floor didn't work very well!",4,2011,04,08
30,"stylish hotel, great staff, a real winner","The hotel offers a shuttle service and collects you at the airport, the times are set, so you may need to hang around for a few minutes. Same shuttle service runs into town and drops you off at the main plaza, which takes about 15 minutes. We weren't aware that places were limited on this and on Sunday, the people behind us weren't allowed on! So get to reception 10 minutes early & stand outside to guarantee yourself a place.
The room was just stunning, especially the dressing/bath room, which is as one, with black marble type walls/floors and mirrors. Lovely toiletries, replenished every day.
King size bed very comfy, electronic curtains with floor to ceiling window (ask for city view, as other side of hotel has poor view). Free wi-fi - ask for the code at reception. iPod dock (which also charges iphone) in room.
Hotel reception very helpful as were all staff. Breakfast has good selection, pre book at reception to save yourself 6 euros - you'll get it for 18 rather than 24.
Pool/gym etc is in adjoining building and you pay per day to use it. We didn't have time, sadly.
The lobby is super trendy but functional and the low level loungers are a great place to read or wait for transport.
Cracking hotel, highly recommended.
The metro red line is approx 3 mins walk from hotel and from here it is approx 25/30 mins on tube to main plaza (Catalunya). Tickets are 1.45 euros per trip. Much bigger carriages than in London, felt safe and was clean.
As stated, hotel is appox 15 mins from main town centre and there didn't appear to be much going on locally. We didn't find this a problem, as we took advantage of free shuttle, used the metro and when we did come home late in a taxi, it was only about 15 euros.
Our town experiences:
Barcelona City Tour (red bus) was great. Paid 30 euros each for 2 days. There are other buses operating, but they seemed to have huge queues (Turistic). Hop-on, hop off. Be aware if you get off at Gaudi's Park Guell, there is a 10 minutes walk, up steep hill from the bus stop. 
Las Ramblas is great and full of atmosphere with it's quirky street entertainers. However, the quality of food at the cafes is poor and over priced - just take yourselves off the main street and you will find plenty of better places, like Del Pi bar in Santa Maria del Pi plaza. 
The highlight of our gastronomique experience in Barcelona was in The Boqueria market (closed Sundays). Just through the entrance is a stall called Bar Pinoxto (pinocchio). We sat at the 'bar', drank local cava. We asked one of the staff for a menu, he replied ""I AM the menu!""
We spent the next hour looking at fabulous things and pointing and tasting! The chickpeas with black pudding was amazing, as were the scrambled eggs with spring onions and asparagus. They are tapas sized portions, so you can try lots of different things!
The shuttle bus drops you off outside a bar, which does great cocktails and limited tapas - it's a good starting point to have a cocktail and plan your evening.
Had an interesting meal at 'Cheese Me' which is located just off the Via Laitana and great wine.
Beware most cafes on the Ramblas serve sangria in very large wine glasses, approx 0.5 litres each, which cost about 14 euros and are a bit ridiculous unless you are sharing!!!
Hope this helps you, have a great trip :-)",5,2011,04,05
30,Business hotel rather than for the tourist,"Did not really choose this hotel, it just happened to have a very cheap offer that got it to the top in last minute.com  The hotel is about 5 years old and is very modern - architecturally not to everyone's taste but the interior is generally a very high standard & comfortable.

Good points: excellent rooms, (even the 'standard' ones are fully equipped), massive comfortable bed, bath robes, slippers, tv (even found BBC programmes), free wifi, minibar, safe etc.  powered curtains (we didn't bother with these as it was a great view over the city from our floor).  Bathrooms had all toiletries supplied, wonderful shower systems, his & her sinks etc.  all in black marble & mirrored - totally impractical but very classy.

Bad points: location, as many have mentioned, though there is a free minibus that takes you into Barcelona if you want - can probably bring you back as well but we never managed to find them for the return journey - I think later in the day they do airport runs etc. so a bit haphazard.  Taxi to city centre is 10euros (from the airport it was 15euros).   Even though the hotel is right next to a major road (the one between city & airport) traffic noise was well insulated, though being on the 18th floor may have assisted as well -  talking of which lifts are very fast and easy to use once the system is explained (though you can just wait for one and then press buttons as normal).  Room keys are cards and the first set didn't work which was slightly annoying, but soon sorted out.
The other big negative is the cost of everything.  I know this is 5 star, but 24 euros for a fairly standard buffet breakfast, even though there was an excellent choice, is very steep. Not even tea/coffee facilities in the room - room service is 24 hour but tea & coffee are 4.5 euros so still pricey (although Barcelona city itself is very expensive un;less you seek out the areas away from the Ramblas etc.).  We opted for the 17 euro breakfast offer (if ordered when booking in) for one morning, just to try it, but after that took a 5 minute walk to a local cafe that did excellent croissants & coffee.  Talking of which at the rear of the hotel are massive blocks of flats that stretch as far as the eye can see - walking around them is a bit depressing, all concrete jungles etc., but the locals are very friendly - make an effort to speak Spanish and you will be rewarded.  Also shops are very much cheaper than in the city.

Other points: The hotel adjoins a large health/sports club where the offered facilities are available, all extras of course.  The very large reception has loads of seating, all very modern but none of it suitable for sitting on - I guess it's to stop people hanging around & making the place untidy!

The final nail in the coffin was that this is definitely a business hotel (probably how they survive and why they charge exorbitant prices).  The whole place was taken over by promotional stuff from a large electrical manufacturer, and on our 2nd day it was over-run by the suited brigade with laptops & blackberrys everywhere - not a very peaceful time from then on, luckily we were out for most of the day & the bar was too pricey even if we could get to it.",3,2011,03,31
30,"Great Hotel, OK location.","We booked this Hotel through lastminute.com as part of their ""secret hotel"" and got a good rate on room only basis. 

The Hotel itself is stylish, well designed and very high end in its specification. 

Good points were: Rooms are very stylish and immaculately clean with great views over the city, free shuttle service into the city 3 times in the morning and twice in the evening, free airport pick up and drop off, very, very helpful staff, metro station is 5 minutes walk away, free wi-fi, Michelin Star restaurant with an amazing panoramic view of the city.

Bad points were: Free water in the rooms? I never understand why a country where the water is not drinkable from the taps does not supply this free in the rooms, you have to pay to use the Spa and gym facilities, food is mega-expensive and there are no other restaurant choices around the Hotel area, location was not too much of a problem for us as we were always planning to be out from morning until night every day but definitely a hassle if you wanted to just pop back for a siesta or a shower.",4,2011,03,26
30,Valentines Trip,"Me and My Boyfriend stayed at the Hesperia Tower for a long Valentines Weekend back in February.
We booked through Lastminute.com as a top secret hotel, and as it was 5* we thought why not!
The hotel was lovely! However it was out of the City Centre, but there was a metro stop on the door step that took you straight in (on the red line).
The rooms were big and spacious, separate bedroom and bathroom/shower/dressing room area. Dressing gowns, slippers, toiletries, hair dryer, straighteners etc.
The hotel itself is for mainly business purposes, I don't think there was many people staying there for leisure purposes, but the staff were very friendly, they organised a free shuttle for us to the airport on our return journey/
There was also a free shuttle service into the city if you didn't want to get on the metro.
Barcelona City itself is lovely! We visited Gaudi's house, Sagrada Familia (the big cathedral he designed thats not finished yet!). We did lots of walking, visited lots of the cultural sites. The port and the beach is amazing! That is a must!
One night we went to Ice Barcelona, located near the beach. Was such good fun, I recommend going there.
Shopping was good, although all shops are shut on Sundays! There is an El Corte Ingles, department store that has everything as well as all the little shops.
Be careful where you eat, the first night we ate on the ramblas in a typical spanish tourist place that was overpriced for what it was. Restaurants down small cobbled walkways hidden away are always best! We also did eat in the Hard Rock Cafe Barcelona on our last day which was nice.
Overall, a really nice city break. Would recommend it for couples as it is quite a romantic city.",4,2011,03,21
30,"Lovely hotel, but expensive breakfast","My wife booked this for out travel to Barcelona for the Arsenal Champions League game.

Overall, its a very smart and well furnished hotel, with plenty of space in the rooms.  The bathroom is lovely, but to many mirrors for those of us who are not catwalk models. lol  

The staff are friendly and helpful although iti does seem a bit like The Matrix with all the dark suits.

The Metro is about a five minute walk away, which in turn is about 35 minutes from the centre of town (La Rambla) or Lecia station which can be reached via the Green line (L3) having changed from the Red line (L1) at Espanyol)

We had a great time, apart from the result being Gooners and the hotel is a nice getaway, even if a bit out of the way.

The staff are channelling those at a 'schrager' hotel. Lots of suited people standing around just waiting to seamlessly help should you need anything (and you may, as the elevator system is design gone mad - but you soon get used to it!).  The bedrooms are lovely, rather more traditional than the communal raes, but still modern, streamlined and stylish -  big enough for a settee and a desk and the bathroom / dressing area seperated by a door. Lots of mirrors everywhere, plenty of storage,  gorgeous jet shower, robes, turn down service, lovely big TV - just everything you need.
I was in a standard room - but even that was nice. Saw a larger (2 storey) room on a higher floor which was also lovely. All in all great.  Food fine - big buffet breakfast with plenty pof choice. Big tables though - maybe not so great for the solo traveller. The service is a tiny bit off though - had to call 3 times before an iron and ironing board were delivered to room. But staff were very aplogetic. Also it is an extra E12 to use the pool or gym - which is just petty and should be included in the room rate. And how about a complimentary bottle of mineral water?  (my bug bear!)
Not a great location if you want to be in the centre of Barcelona - but perfecly fine for business and not sight seeing.",5,2011,03,13
30,Excellent hotel,"Ohh i love this hotel.
We were there for Christmas vacation and absolutely loved our stay here.
But be aware that it is a bit farther than central, which wasn't the problem as it is very well connected with the metro across the road.
Only thing we missed was, not vegetarian options in their restaurants menu.",5,2011,03,03
30,Such a fabulous hotel!!!,"One of the best hotels I've ever visited! The service was excellent, and the view... My room was on the 8th floor, but in a building with 20+ floors this low! However, the view was great and we really enjoyed it!

I got a parking ticket and the staff contacted the police for me (as I don't speak Spanish and there was noone in the police department to communicate in English). They were really helpful!",5,2011,02,25
30,Great hotel but out of city centre,"I stayed at this hotel in Feb for a two day conference which took over the entire hotel. The rooms were spacious, clean and modern, staff were friendly and efficient and the food was excellent. When the hotel is full as is was during my visit, there can be a wait for the lifts (hotel consists of 25 floors).
The hotel is not in the centre of Barcelona but I believe that those that did travel to the centre found it easy to do so.",5,2011,02,20
30,Much better than expected!,"After reading the reviews I was very concerned about the cost of traveling to the centre everyday from this hotel...however it was only 10/15 minutes away and the free shuttle bus was perfect. It also only cost 12 Euros back in a cab from Las Ramblas. I guess if there is traffic the price would go up, but the buses and trains are prompt and cheap. We got the number 46 bus from the airport and it was only 2 stops away at a cost of 2 euros each!

Seriously the rooms were lovely and the staff VERY helpful and friendly. We had a few drinks at the bar and a bottle of good wine was 19 Euros, not bad for a 5 star hotel. 

It is pretty ugly from the outside which can be off putting but instead is lovely.

We booked this through secret hotels and I tried to get out of the booking once I found out the location...but I am glad I stayed as it was not 45 minutes into the centre. It did cost 18 euros to the airport by taxi and once again we did not have any traffic so it could be more.

I was not blown away by the expensive breakfast but the room service was good (although expensive). I would recommend the cocktails though!

I would stay here again!",5,2011,02,07
30,Very nice hotel but location might not suit everyone,"I was staying in Barcelona for three nights to attend two bar association functions and as I booked last minute, I booked this hotel through the secret hotels option of lastminute.com because the nightly rate was great for such a high spec hotel.  The hotel does a shuttle bus from the hotel, but as I was arriving after 10pm I needed to get a taxi which was about a 20euro to the hotel.  Public transport would have been an option but I didn't fancy it that late at night.  

The hotel certainly is very impressive in appearance.  Incredibly modern and sleek, but I imagine it might not be to everyone's tastes.  

I was very pleased with the room,  It was very clean and huge, especially as it was just me in it.  The room also came with an ipod dock, hair dryer and straightners, dressing down, free safe deposit box and fridge.  The shower was also great.  There's also a tv but I didn't use it.  View out of my window was mostly of the motorway, which wasn't exactly amazing but the light was lovely.  The bed was very comfortable and there was absolutely no noise coming from anywhere.  The air con was good too. 

The breakfast is not included an cost 20euro.  I got this on the first morning (and ate as much as I could) and then got fruit and croissants to eat in my room the next two mornings.  I'd also recommend buying bottled water before checking in as the stuff in the room was extorionate and the water out of the tap disgusting.  Prices in the hotel generally were pretty steep (5euro for a cappuchino) but I didn't eat or drink in the hotel very much. 

The spa attached is not for exclusive use of the hotel.  I found using it pretty stressful (not what you want from a spa) as the girl at reception was just frankly rude and I after going to the spa knowing I had to pay 12euros, I was told I had to go back to the hotel to pay there and then come back with a coin.  Why this was necessary, I couldn't tell you!  Flipflops and a hat also required to be purchased (about 4euro altogether) but I knew in advance due to another tripadvisor review, so had brought them with me. 

Getting to and from the city centre wasn't too much of a hassle considering the distance.  The hotel run shuttles to the city centre, dropping off at Plaza Catulunya but they won't return you to the hotel.  Taxi ride to/from town was about 13euro.  The red line of the metro does take you almost right to the hotel from La Ramblas but takes about 30mins.  

All in all, it was great for my purposes and an absolute bargain via secret hotels.  However, the distance from town might not be great for everyone.",4,2011,02,07
30,Excellent Hotel,"Just had one night stopover at this hotel but would definately use again if in Barcelona. SItuated mid way between airport and town. Rooms excellent, spacious, clean and luxurious. I always like to find something to complain about and am struggling.

Ah one thing - no tissues in bathroom!",5,2011,02,04
30,Don't let the location put you off!,"Yes, the hotel is at the end of the red metro line but it really doesn't take 45 minutes as suggested in a previous review. It takes about 20 and the trains run every 3 minutes. Even when we returned after midnight the trains were every 6 minutes. So unless you have mobility problems or really can't be away from the centre of the city, nothing to be concerned about. Metro ultra modern and felt safe. The courtesy bus was fantastic and will take you into the city either for the day or evening. Takes 15 minutes at most and runs like clockwork. Also back to the airport if you like.  Room could not be faulted, super clean, fantastic fittings and jet spray shower. Staff lovely, extremely helpful and went out of their way to help us plan our day. Superb breakfast,  fantastic views albeit of the outskirts of the city. We booked at a discount price of  ¬£80.00 per night for a double room, definitely the nicest hotel I've stayed in for this price.",5,2011,01,28
30,Futuristic!,"We stayed in Barcelona at the Hesperia Tower Hotel which has a very modern/futuristic decor, with spacious room, great staff & service providing all the information we needed to get around.   Several restaurants including a ""spaceship"" atop the hotel! Conveniently located to the Metro transit system within 2 minutes walking - so it's very convenient to go into the City and get to many other places. While only there 2 days - we were treated very well - and the shuttle driver took us directly to the NCL cruise terminal - not part of  the normal airport/hotel route service.",5,2010,12,08
30,Excellent base for my sightseeing holiday,"I booked this hotel for a 7 day holiday in September 2010 through lastminute.com as a top secret hotel as it seemed a good deal for such a high spec hotel.  I had an excellent holiday, though whether it would be right for you will mainly depend on whether you are happy with its location.

Good points

The location is ideal for the airport as it is near the first bus stop inside the city, so arriving on an evening flight was no problem.   The hotel is also next to the Hospital de Bellvitge metro station, which is a direct route into the city but has15 stops (count them !) and took 30 to 45 minutes to reach central Barcelona.  If you are happy to get the metro or bus into the city in the morning and return in the evening this hotel is ideal.
Hotel staff were really friendly and helped me enjoy my stay.
The breakfasts were divine - make sure they are included in the cost of the stay.  5 courses filled me up for a day of sightseeing until evening meal most days.
I had no problem with noise from other hotel rooms.
The view of Barcelona is fantastic, particularly when arriving at night.

Bad points

Don't book this hotel if you want to be near the sights, or the beach, or if you want somewhere that is easy to return to during the day, or as a base to enjoy Barcelona's nightlife.  It's primarily a business hotel.  Next door is a big shop selling electrical goods e.g. cameras and memory cards, but other than that I didn't find anywhere nearby selling food.
English language TV is pretty much limited to news channels.  If you speak Spanish, there are more.  The lady on Reception said this was the same throughout hotels in Barcelona due to their only being one TV transmitter for the whole of Barcelona.
The swimming pool is located next door in what seemed to be a separate sports centre.  As well as a costume and goggles, you also have to buy a swimming cap and flip flops for the pool and pay 12 euros per day to use the facilities.  It didn't seem like hotel residents were getting a better deal than the locals.  There wasn't any literature at hotel reception saying what to do or where to go.  After working it all out, it felt like their were just too many obstacles to having an early or late dip in the pool, so reluctantly I gave swimming a miss.
There isn't much to do in the evenings except read the FT, watch news and plan tomorrow's itinerary.
Internet access requires an internet capable device - don't expect a computer terminal in your room like I did.
I had a few minor problems but nothing that spoiled an excellent holiday.

One last thing

I had been put off traveling to Barcelona for years because of its bad reputation for pickpocketing.  One of the first things I heard in English over the loudspeakers in the metro and at the beach were warnings to look out for distractions and to look after your belongings but after taking sensible precautions I didn't see or encounter any problems at all.  The metro was clean and extremely efficient with spacious trains arriving every 3 minutes - much more modern than in London.",5,2010,12,05
30,For those who just want to kick back and relax!,"I stayed at the Hesperia Tower with my husband for my Birthday Weekend. 
The hotel its situated at the end of the red Metro line and it takes around 20-30 minutes to get into the centre of town so in that sense you will feel isolated. The nearest metro is less than 5 minutes away from the hotel. It is recommened to get the 10 trip travelcard from the station so that you can use it for your trips and it will save you money

The Hotel is more suited for the business traveller as you have to pay for everything and there is no tea or coffee in the rooms. The staff are very helpful and aim to make you stay as comfortable as possible 

The rooms are pretty amazing with their suede celling to floor headboards and their open plan bathroom/shower area. Everything is finished to an immaculate standard.",4,2010,11,30
30,Nice but a little too far out,"This hotel is truly lovely, its just a shame about the location.  The Metro is extremely handy and the courtesy bus is great but when you're coming from at night, it seems quite far.  I didn't eat here as the food seemed quite expensive but I think that's nearly the norm for Barcelona.",3,2010,11,29
30,amazing hotel - spectacular views,"Easy to access this hotel from the airport using the public bus as it only costs 1euro 40. The hotel does run a curtosy bus at set times and they emailed this to us prior to our visit. We used it to get to the city one night and for our return to the UK. We had a view of the city which was stunning and was on the 18th floor. The breakfast was great - a good selection for all tastes. We had access to the tower club and this was a lovely addition to the stay as we could have a glass of wine and light snacks during the day or in the evening. We used the spa and although it was extra we felt it was worth it as we spent a few hours using the facilities. We found the location of the hotel great for the metro and was glad it was outside the centre. We purchased a t-10 card for just under 8euros and this was simple and quick. 
Would highy recommend this hotel to others.",5,2010,11,28
30,4 days of pure luxury!,"We were absolutely blown away with this hotel! We arrived at the hotel before our room was ready (check in was available from 3 but our flight landed in the morning) but we were able to drop our case off, and jumped on the free shuttle bus at 12.20, which takes approx 15 minutes to get to the city centre. It drops you off very conveniantly at the Placa  de Catalunya which is at the top of Las Ramblas. We were expecting to go back to the hotel and sleep for the rest of the afternoon due to our early flight, but we arrived back at the hotel and were escorted to our room, and were wowed by the room! We had booked the suite, it was much better than the pictures! We spent half an hour just looking at everything and taking pictures! The view from the 12th floor was amazing, as was the jacuzzi. As we had booked the suite, we were allowed in to the Tower Club -great! We hadn't pre-booked breakfast, but the Tower Club opens at 11am with a continental buffet, and bar, you can walk in and help yourselves, after showing your key card. We also had access to the spa and swimming pool, which was lovely! I advise you to take some flip flops, you are told to wear them around the pool. However, I didn't have any and the receptionist suggested I wear the slippers provided in our room; they were very slippy on the wet floor! We used the free shuttle bus a couple of times, but mainly relied on taxis to get into the city centre, average price of about 12 euros. On our last night we also ate in the Axis Restaurant in the hotel, we paid 75 euros for 2 drinks, a pizza, a steak and 2 desserts - was lovely! Have got a serious case of the post-holiday blues since returning!",5,2010,11,26
30,We loved it........Cant wait to go again,"Beautiful Modern Hotel on the outskihrts of Barcelona. The service was amazing and the reception staff couldnt have been nicer explaining the Metro, shuttle Bus and Services within the area. We had a wonderful room on the 13th floor with amazing views of the city by night, great beds had wonderful sleep for the 4 nights we stayed.
Yes the Hotel is outsided the city but we found that good that we could come away from the hussle and bussle of the city and totally relax.
I would highly recommend this hotel we love it and cant wait for our next visit.",5,2010,11,22
30,Good business hotel with nice outside view,"I  had to attend a conference at Barcelona..so stayed at Hesperia for 11 days
Good conference rooms with all modern facilities available
My room was also very nice with beautiful interior...
my room was on 14th floor ..so view outside was superb..
Hotel is far from city center but is very near to metro station...so this solved the problem
plus there is shuttle facility from hotel that drops you to city center and airport..save some euros
Only thing i found missing was that there was no coffee maker in the room",4,2010,11,19
30,Overpriced Extras and miles from Barcelona,"On the plus side: smart hotel, with modern decor.
 Fairly close to the airport. 
Nice bright room with a nice modern bathroom and very big comfy bed. 
Good soundproofing.

On the minus side: Miles from the city centre.
Taxis expensive with no set tarrif. 
No shuttle bus as previously mentioned. 
The extras were extortionate, breakfast at 25 euro each. 
Yes, the hotel had a pool but as with everything else you had to pay extra to use it. 
The menu in the hotel lobby had a very poor menu and a massive wait. 
The main restaurant was closed at 9.30 pm. 
Nothing in the vicinity of the hotel to either visit or eat in. 
Room cervice was very very slow and took three attempts to get the order correct.
 The shower was luke warm at best. Our room with a view had a view of three different motorways, an office block and in the distanc ethe airport tower. 
Yes it was a view, but not exactly what we were expecting!

To sum the hotel Hesperia tower up, we only booked it through the 'surprise booking' option. Great modenr decor, but poor service and awful location. Do not stay here unless you are on a business trip and your company is picking up the tab and you have a convention actually at the hotel. There were so many other hotels in the same price bracket which were actually in Barcelona and close to restuarants, theatres and attractions.",1,2010,11,15
30,"If you're not bothered about being in the centre, this is a great hotel","We stayed there recently for a birthday weekend.  It is located outside of the centre, but 2-3 mins walk from a Metro stop, and it took approx 20mins on the Metro to get right in the centre near La Rambla.  This was fine for us, as we had no issues using the Metro and for those of you who've never used it before, out of all the undergrounds I've used outside the UK I found this easy to use - very similar set up to London.

The staff were all helpful and pleasant.  We did not have breakfast booked and for the price I would recommend ordering a la carte and having it delivered to your room.....we both got poached eggs on toast, a pot of tea and pot of coffee for the cost of 1 person's continental breakfast in the restaurant.  We ate in the downstairs bar one night and the food was lovely, however if you're after a cheap holiday then this hotel isn't for you!  The cost of some starters were around 11-15 euros and most drinks were 11 euros.  We did want to eat in the restaurant on the top floor as it looked amazing.  We enquired at reception and looked at the menus - 2 to choose from, 1 around 90euro per person and the other about 140euro per person but we were very disappointed with the choices - it was a set menu and if you don't like fish or seafood then it's not for you.  This was a real shame as we were really looking forward to eating there.  

The rooms were very modern and clean and we had a gorgeous view from our window.  The room wasn't particularly big, but we'd got 2 single beds (pushed together) a small sofa and dressing table.  The layout of the room was quite unusual - as you enter the room you're immediately in the bathroom with a wardrobe and then a door leading to a toilet and another door leading to the shower.  

The only down-side to this hotel was lack of atmosphere.  I don't know if it's because of the time of year we travelled but there was hardly anyone in the bar area so not much atmosphere.  

Overall I would recommend this hotel if you're wanting a bit of luxury mixed with a city break.",4,2010,11,10
30,AMAZING HOTEL!!,"Just back from our 6 night stay in the Hesperia Hotel and cannot fault it in any way. We booked with aer lingus hush hush deal and were not dissapointed and got an excellant rate aswell. I was abit hesistant about the hotel once i started reading the bad reviews on this but now after being there for a week, I don't understand what there is to complain about. The room was beautiful and spotless with an astonishing view even from the 10th floor, the receptionist was helpful and very friendly, we arrived at 12pm from the airport, from which the shuttle bus picked us up from, and our room was availble straight away! And no we wernt dressed in suits like a few reviews mention, we were casually dressed. The metro is located around 200 yards away, which is perfect and so easy to use as you are on the last stop of the red line L1 and you go 8 stops to get into the city centre. We used the metro every evening coming home but got the excellant shuttle bus every morning with the timetable for the shuttle located at the entrance of the hotel. As we had to check out at 12pm and our flight wasnt leaving till late that evening, we left our luggage with reception, where they give you a ticket with a number on it and bring it into the luggage room, so it is safe, and got the shuttle into the city.. be aware of pickpockets!! The shuttle bus also runs in the evening so we got it to the airport! Didnt pay for a taxi once through the whole week stay! In relation to breakfast, it is quite pricey as our deal was room only, so to save money for shopping we went to the crossaint shop at the back of the hotel on the street and ate there every morning and then went to town. I would highly recommend the Strawberry Daiquiri, wonderful cocktail used with fresh strawberrys! I will defintely be heading back to this hotel when in barcelona again! I already miss the room and the view and the wonderful bed!",5,2010,11,10
30,Hesperia Tower Hotel is a nice place to stay but is not very near the tourist trap areas.,"The Towers is in a quiet and safe area of town right off the freeway.  Towers is recessed enough from the freeway that you don't get a lot of traffice noise either.  There are no major bustling tourist centers or shops nearby that you would walk to and you can't really see into the ""downtown"" area.  You are also not enclosed in by a lot of tightly packed buildings, so you do get a view of the general open landscape.  Instead, be prepared to take the underground subway to Las Ramblas to get your tourist groove on (10-15? miles to the downtown area or about a 9 stop or 20-25 minute ride).  The subway is easy to ride, but make sure you ask the hotel receptionist how to locate it from the front lobby.  I'd say that it is about 600 yards off the front of the hotel entrance and is not really marked with clear signage.  It is essentially a stairway leading underground to where you can purchase tickets from an ATM machine (~$5 euro per person for a 24 hour pass).  You can also easily get to the pier by taking a taxi, which will run somewhere in the neighborhood of $25-30 euro and take about 20 minutes.  I would not really recommend hopping on the subway to get to the downtown area with all your luggage (unless you are traveling really light) and then trying to catch a taxi to the pier which would be relatively close.  The reason is that it is simply too much to try and lug 600 yards to the entrance and then around on a subway train and back up to the street level.  It can be done, but I wouldn't really recommend it.

When you enter the Towers, you will get the feeling of the modern element of the design architecture and that theme will continue as you take the elevators and walk into your room.  I'd describe the hotel as ""clean"" but not necessarily ""new"" feeling.  Maintanence on the property is reasonable and you shouldn't be disappointed by the amenities.  The showerin the rooms is pretty nice, if you are into that kind of thing.  There is a 3 star Michelin restaurant that sits at the top of the towers but you need a reservation in advance to eat there (cost is minimum of $100 euro per person).  When we went to just take a look, there wasn't anyone there but they still insisted that you have a reservation if that gives you an idea of the 'atmosphere' there.  Oh yeah, and no pictures please!  This isn't to say that the staff isn't friendly or helpful when asked for help.  On the other hand, I didn't notice that they went out of their way to make you feel welcome or find out what they could do to make your stay a more pleasant or memorable one.

This is a hotel that you would want to stay at if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas and can catch a deal to save some money.  I'd stay there again if it were just a quick stop through.  If you were going to stay a bit longer, you can probably find a better place closer to the downtown area.  We went in mid November and the hotel was not crowded at all.  The weather was pretty nice to boot (not bitterly cold, just cool).",4,2010,11,09
30,didn't want to leave.,"We stayed for 3 nights, we booked as a secret hotel with last minute. com, when we arrived we upgraded to a suite which gave us access to the tower club, spa and gave us the option for a late check out. The room was amazing with a view over the city, with a lounge huge dressing room and bathroom with a spa bath and a shower and lovely toiletries. The bed very comfortable. The Tower Club was great, had breakfast there every morning and the cakes in the afternoon were beautiful. We didnt use the spa, we didnt have time, a little tip if you are going to use the pool you need a swimming cap. The shuttle was great and the Metro easy to get back on. The staff were always willing to help and although room service isnt cheap we used it on a couple of occassions.",5,2010,11,06
30,Great hotel for the price.,"If you receive a good online deal for this hotel I would definitely recommend it. The hotel is not in the center of Barcelona, but the price was well worth it. It felt like a four star hotel in the United States. The staff, service, and rooms were great! There is a complimentary shuttle that picks you up in the airport and/or takes you to Las Ramblas. The hotel shuttle isn‚Äôt very frequent, but we were always able to catch a ride heading to Las Ramblas. We saved at least $100 of the free transportation. They even took a group of us to the port to catch our cruise although it‚Äôs not typical! If you are unable to catch the shuttle, the train station is a 3 minute walk.

Although the neighborhood is not touristic, you can get some cheap breakfast at local cafeterias. There is a caf√© called 365 caf√© where we ate every day. The service was great and 4 of us at 10 EURO each day!",5,2010,11,03
30,"Great Room, good views, at end of metro line.","Great place to stay if you can get a good deal, excellent rooms.  Meals are expensive; even breakfast is 24 euros (19 euros if you book in advance!). We brought in cereal bars.  No tea making facility, but a mini-fridge (and mini-bar). Best to be aware that everything is likely to be extra.  Rooms are from the 7th to 19th floor. The hotel is fairly isolated, near a hospital, and regularly has conference delegates. There is a handy metro station, bus route, and occasional courtesy bus into Placa Catalunya, the centre of Barcelona. Can also bus or occasional courtesy bus to the airport.  All journeys of any length on metro or bus are 1.40 euro, unless you buy a day/multiple ticket.  Would recommend the open-top bus trips to get an idea of where all the sights are.",4,2010,11,02
30,Great Hotel Stunning Views.,The hotel was very nice.  We booked on lastminute.com secret hotel and got an amazing deal.  The hotel was very clean and the rooms were fantastic.  The staff was helpful and overall our stay was great.  The hotel is near the metro and is about 20 minutes from Las Ramblas.,5,2010,10,29
30,Dont eat anything here but sleep and be happy!!,"We stayed here for 3 nights this week. The hotel is v.easy to get to from the airport,10 min taxi ride. Then it is super handy to get into the city centre on the metro, which was really cost efficient 20e for 4 days. About a 4 min walk from hotel to metero station. Then it took about 22 mins to get to playa del catalyuna.
The interiors of the hotel are lovely, contemporary, comfortable and stylish. 
The bar is comfortable and the bedrooms are plush, toilitries are bland ensure you bring your own, but the shower is great, and the bed was lovely. Views are also good from the hotel once you have a room above floor 10.
The hotel is a lovely base, but do not eat here. The food is substandard and horrendously overpriced. It was really frustrating to have few other choices to eat and have to pay so far over the odds for it.
Service was hit and miss. Some staff were plain rude and others were charming. Overall, based on the price we paid with lastminutes.com secret deal it was a worthwhile stay.",4,2010,10,28
30,worth saying,"It is a nice and well run hotel. Close to metro station to get to the town center. Professionally run hotel with professional staff. 
Cihat from Istanbul",5,2010,10,27
30,Excellent place to stay,"I stayed in this hotel the last night of my trip, mostly for its proximity to the airport as i had an early flight (5am).  Front desk crew was so helpful, i was told that i could order whatever i wanted, if they didnt have it they would get it for me.  The only little problem is the location which is far from central core and it looked to me like it was in the middle of nowhere, but downtown is a short subway ride in Barcelona's excellent public transit system, and yes,  there is a subway station just a few steps away from the hotel. 
Breathtaking views of the city from the window.  Perfect hotel to finish a perfect trip to Barca!",5,2010,10,25
30,"Luxurious modern vibrant and comfortable, with fantastic views of the city.","Just spent 2 nights at this hotel, got it at a snip of the price at laterooms.com. First thing to say is don't let the distance from Barcelona put you off. 
We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel and a standard minimum charge of ‚Ç¨25 was the fee.
We were located on the 16th floor, the hotel is very secure with the room cards activating the lift. The room was wonderful with what has to be the best shower in the world, settee, floor to ceiling windows with views over the city. There was a pillow menu and aircon. The prices in the bar were comparable to what you would pay in the city, with a round of drinks for 4 costing about ¬£18. As you come out of the hotel, there is a roundabout, where if you go straight over and head in a left diagonal direction across the carpark, you will see the link to the metro. Its a 2-3 minute walk. A single trip for 4 cost ‚Ç¨5 which is much cheaper than a taxi. This is the red line. If you get off at Catalanya stop you come out at the ramblas.
Although other reviews will say it is inconvenient for it's location, we personally did not find this to be the case and would certainly return to this hotel.",5,2010,10,20
30,Better than expected,"We booked this hotel as a lastminute.com secret hotel after our accommodation in the centre of Barcelona got cancelled a week before our trip.  The hotel is easy to access via the metro and the free mini bus in to the city is great (get there earlier as it can fill quickly).  We were upgraded to a suite which made the whole stay wonderful, having the extra space and 2 person bath was lovely.  We also found the staff very accommodating - I guess it depends on who you get at the front desk.  We asked about the parking and were told about the cost and so we parked the hire car for one night out on the street just beside the hotel.  We had no problems.  There is a supermarket near by - where all the local apartments are.  There is also a fruit and vegetable shop, two or three cafes/patisseries.  I would go to one of these if you have some Spanish language skills rather than having the hotel breakfast.  Most days we actually caught the mini bus in and had breakfast at one of the cafes around Plaza Catalyna.  My father joined us for one night and the staff were very good and made sure his room was on the same floor as ours which made life easier.  My only complaint is that there isn‚Äôt really anywhere nearby to eat an evening meal ‚Äì and we found that once we got back in after a day of sight seeing we really didn‚Äôt want to head back into the city centre.  As to Barcelona, enjoy the sites but beware the pickpockets ‚Äì we thankfully got one who was at the beginning of his career and my father‚Äôs walking stick and my large stature had him well on his way before anything was taken.  Interestingly enough, my husband and I hadn‚Äôt had any problems ‚Äì so I do think they thought my dad was easy prey.
My final bit of advice would be - if you want somewhere that puts you in the centre of things - don't stay here - if you want somewhere to relax and to sleep then it is great.",4,2010,10,18
30,Beautiful and stylish - on the outskirts,"This hotel is very chic and stylish in the modern style for which Barcelona has become famous. The rooms are ample and comfortable, with a special mention going to the shower, which has multiple spray settings for a really nice shower experience.
The breakfast buffet was nice, especially the delicious espresso-style coffees available, but think carefully before commiting to the rather steep price of 25‚Ç¨ per person for breakfast.
The hotel is actually in one of the ""outskirt"" neighborhoods of Barcelona, but the downtown and Gothic Quarter vare easily reachable by a 25-30 minute ride on the Metro. Ask the hotel staff to direct you to the Metro station, located just across the street, a quick 5-minute walk from the front door.",4,2010,10,12
30,wonderful hotel,"At the beginning we were afraid because the hotel was downtown.  We took Metro, we get off the last station, we walk 1 block and the hotel was right there.  Beautiful, contemporary, new, extreme cleanliness, everything one word:  WONDERFUL.  We did pay a very good rate.  Everytime I remember this hotel I cannot stop to make comparisons, this is VERY VERY nice compare to many others that I have stayed.",5,2010,10,12
30,"Glorified Travel Lodge, Typical Business Venue.","First impression very modern which we liked. Arrived 1pm room not available however we were asked if we would like to upgrade for an extra 50 euros per night we could have room on a high floor and Jacuzzi that was available, we declined the offer.  It was not problem that the room was not ready (hotel states 3pm) as we ventured out around the surrounding residential area. Found a local precinct where you will find a local cafe 365 a small supermarket and local cafe/bar local beer 1.50 Euro. not really ideal but friendly enough. A little further on more bars/restaurant. Arrived back at the hotel at 4pm told that the hotel was fully booked and the room available had twin beds however we may be able to change in the next few days! Room on the 17th floor clean and acceptable a bit whacky with the mirrors in the bathroom on entering.(I think an earlier reviewer mentioned the hall of mirrors). No trouser press/iron or tea and coffee making facilities which we would normally expect in a 5*. Free hotel shuttle bus into Cataluyana/las Ramblas very good service with a pleasant and friendly lady driver. Across from the hotel is the local metro Red L1 single ticket 1.2euro(multiple day tickets also available) takes you into the city and beyond if needed. Centre strip on Las Rambla can be overpriced be sure to venture up and down the side streets and find local bars that can be half the price of main area. Back to the hotel still no double bed available for us we put up with the twin beds(for 6 nights) which we are sure had been wheeled over from the local hospital. The hotel advertises oversized comfortable beds this was not in our case maybe we should have been more pushy. After 4 day/nights of exploring we decided to have a meal in the hotel .Rang through to room service got through after 30minutes to ask for a bucket of ice at a cost 5Euro for the pleasure but would be free if you we would take our bucket down to reception!  The bar and restaurant was not open at the time of our stay which we found misleading. We ate in the reception area at the tables service and menu limited. Evo restaurant was available on the 29th floor at 145.00 Euro per person on reflection of the service I would hardly think it would be up to 5* star treatment. We did book the hotel at a discount rate and got discount service and attention. We had been spoilt early this year by  5*star treatment at the Westin Hotel Dubai where that is truly 5* and above in all aspects. The hotel we feel in the main was for business use for 1 or 2 nights where expenses can be maxed! We stayed 6 nights and would suggest 4 nights plenty to view all sights and enjoy the city.",3,2010,10,12
30,Luxurious place to stay at a bargain price!,"A Top secret deal with Lastminute.com.

We loved this hotel - probably the best hotel either of us have stayed in, ever!   Very futuristic with all mod cons, and fantastic shower!  We didn't close the (electrically operated) curtains during our stay, as we loved the views over the city so much, especially at night - stunning!

We found the staff to be helpful, polite and courteous, even offering advice before our first trip into the centre, re the crime problem,

Thanks to this site, we avoided the costly restaurants in the hotel, and went to the cafes round the corner for breakfast (Aurora's cafe has a bakery next door.)  Right out of the hotel, right again, then left into little precinct (which was being remodelled during our visit).  Less than 5 mins.  There is also a small supermarket in the complex.

We did treat ourselves to a room service dinner on the last night, which arrived on a table/trolley with heated unit with our meals in!  Price-wise this turned out to be fairly reasonable and a delicious meal.

We were not driving, so avoided parking charges, though there are probably parking possibilities at the metro station opposite.  Also, we didn't use the spa etc - there was too much to do in the centre of Barcelona!!

The metro is great - far cheaper, cleaner, more efficient and better overall than the London underground, though beware of pickpockets - we were almost victims at La Rambla, going to the metro.

Definitely if you want to stay somewhere fantastic and don't need to be right in the centre, try this designer hotel.... reviewers who didn't like this place must have paid a lot more!",5,2010,10,10
30,Nice hotel.....but,"Stayed here in August after vacation around Europe. Nice hotel, really nice rooms but there isn't too much around for amenities.  Don't plan on using the pool unless you pay the extra $$ per person along with the extra $$ for parking.  Front counter staff was unaccomodating.  We arrived early at around 8am after a 12 hour flight. No rooms available until after 3pm.... apparently they were fully booked.  However wear a business suit and you won't have to wait to get a room in  the fully booked hotel.",3,2010,09,30
30,If you book as a bargain watch out for all the extras they add on,"We paid ¬£93 for a room via last minute.com 1 day before which we thought was a good deal for a 5* hotel on a busy Friday night (it was the Bareceloan fiesta or festival).  We read some reviews and realised it was out of town but that worked for us as we were drving down form the South of France, and figured it would work better for parking.  I would say that at ¬£93 ithe hotel was good value - the rooms are good and comfortable and the shower is fantastic - but we eneded up paying signifianctly more than that.

They seem to have been taking business lessons from Ryan Air because they sting you with exorbitant charges at every turn.  Breakfast was quoted as 24 euros, using the spa and gym that was part of the hotel was 12 euros (we opted to do this and it is a nice gym and spa although there were no treatments available and we would have had to pay extra to use raquet courts) and parking for less than 24 hours was 22 euros.  It was this that really got to me - there was no mention of this on the website, in the car park or when we checked in - it was only mentioned when we checked out and it was added to our bill as 'upselling - car park'.  While this is a strong a viable business model for a budget airline i don't think it really fits with a 5* hotel where you expect these types of things to be included as part of the basic package.

The staff were brusque and slightly confrontational when I stated I was not happy about this and basically told me that is how things work in Spain.

So in conclusion I would say that this hotel is a bit like a Ryan Air flight - a really good bargain if you know exactly what you are getting and managed to dodge all the extra charges or don't need them, but not really worth it if you are driving or if you think you may want to use some of the other facilities of the hotel.",2,2010,09,28
30,"Expensive, unhelpful staff, but quite a nice hotel, although a little dirty.","Expensive, unhelpful staff, but quite a nice hotel, although a little dirty. Could have been a wonderfull experience but staff need to be more welcoming. Just got the feeling that staff could not be bothered to answer any questions or offer any help. The quality should be there for the price of the hotel and the rating. Could be a great hotel but they need to do more because the location is not as central as others.",3,2010,09,27
30,Trendy,"Out of town, close to the Airort and Barcelona Fira. Great views: rooms hqve great sound insulation ensuring good sleep: the leisure centre and spa were great",4,2010,09,22
30,Great for a short break,"Like many others I bagged a bargain at this 5* hotel using lastminute.com secret location and I was very pleased I did. Links to the centre of Barcelona are good. We didn't find the metro until the evening so didn't use it but a taxi wasn't expensive' around 12 euros, and the hotel run their free transfer bus.

We stayed one night post cruise, unfortunately it was a Sunday so almost everywhere was closed. We did eventually find the cafes nearby to the hotel one of which was open. 

The area is of little interest but is safe, and it's near to the airport. 

The rooms are what really make this hotel, they are really fabulous. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the shower has to be the beat ever. T.V has several English,Spanish and French channels, and wifi was free.

Drinks and food prices at the hotel are extortionate. We had burgers via room service (came to almost 50 euros) , but we got our drinks from the garage across the road.",4,2010,09,21
30,stop reading...get booking..,"I travelled to the Hesperia with my partner for a three night break on 12th Sep. Booked through lastminute.com (well actually Tescos travel website which uses lastminute but you get tescos points!) only two days before we travelled. Flying with easyjet we took hand luggage only and it was a breeze! I`d done my research before i booked and was confident i would get this hotel as a 'sectret' hotel- and i was right! Cheaper than most hostels- the price of this was brilliant!!!

I feel i need to clear up the transport situation and put the moaners to rights..
We telephoned the hotel the night before to find out minibus airport transfer times..
We arrived at terminal 2 at 10:30am and got the transfer bus to terminal 1. From there we went to exit 'G' and down the stairs to a 'minibus' drop off point and waited to be picked up...for free! (its a black minibus with Hesperia on)Really quite simple. we were told the minibus was leaving the hotel at 11.40 so expect it around 11:50/12. plenty of time to find our way.

On arrival we were given the 14th floor! amazing! views/bedroom/bathroom fabulous! 5 star without doubt. Shower amazing! I would like the names of the hotels that people who disagree with this have stayed at...as i`d like to see better..

12 euros for breakfast... dont bother.. if you walk through the residential park behind the hotel there is a patisserie..2 pastry 1.5ltr water, fanta and a chocolate drink 3euros! wonderful! 

Metro- super easy. Get the free bus in to the centre.. they run fairly regular in the AM. 11:40 (i think) and 12:20 are the ones we got - but theres a notice board by the door in reception. Buy the T10 ticket (just under 8 euro)and it should cover all your journeys back! Dont bother getting the unlimited pass. 

We recommend the chinese restaurant on the right hand side of Las Ramblas! Best chinese, freshly cooked food, cooked in front of you.. also - you must do a bus tour... its the only way you`ll see it! 

Random *Make sure all the chicken is cooked in Barcelona though... it seemed a bit of an issue for some.. and only take out the money you need for the evening.. keep your T10 ticket seperate just in case so you can get home.. pickpocketing is the highest here but thankfully we didnt have any problems!

So now... go out and book! dont worry about the distance.. probably a bit more of a pain if you are going for any longer than 3/4 nights but its nice to be in a safe residential area away from the action and travel is super easy! I`m missing the comfy big beds already!",5,2010,09,17
30,On a short trip To Barcelona? Stay somewhere closer.,"We've been to Barcelona before, so felt we could manage being further 'from the action' for this trip. The Hesperia seemed to fit the bill at 5* on a discount offer.

We drove to Barcelona, so the first problem we faced was finding the hotel. Our newish Tom-Tom had no record of either the address or the hotel! We did have a choice of 2 Gran Via, be sure to select Gran Via des corts Catalanes or you will end up in the middle of town, probably during rush hour (like us). Upon arrival we discovered that parking at the Hotel was 24 Euro a day, excessive for so far out of the city. The next was that the hotel staff didn't volunteer any helpful information at all! Very odd as all our other stays in the area had very helpful staff. 
The Hotel lobby is very open, with low rectangular blocks of furniture pushed together to resemble seating, It didn't give the best of first impressions. Certainly not a 5* impression.
The elevators are somewhat 'clever', partially sighted or less alert?, beware. 

Entering the room from the landing corridor we found ourself straight into the bathroom, very unusual, it reminded me of the hall of mirrors from old fairgrounds. The bathroom had an excellent shower (that unfortunately leaked through the wall and onto the toilet floor (and obviously had done so for a while.) The bed was large and comfortable. The rest of the decor was a dark wood finish, not really 5 star in our opinion. The room seemed clean, but when we moved the settee it was obvious it hadn't been cleaned underneath for a while. (I did find a 'free' battery though!)

We were on the 21st floor and hoped for great views, instead we had a view of a housing estate, a major road and a commercial area, hardly inspiring, but your room may do better.

The hotel wasn't busy and as result was very quiet, the comfy bed meant we slept well.

The swimming pool was operated seperately with a 12 euro charge. We felt it was misleading to not make the point on the hotel website.

Getting into Barcelona is a 3 minute walk to the underground station Directly in front of the hotel entrance, (but not visible from there). It's the L1 Line, colour coded, red. and a 30 minute journey to Catalunya (at the top of Les Rambles). The trains were very efficient, frequent and clean, cost per journey was a very reasonable 1.2 Euro.)

The hotel was very good value on the special offer price we had (65 euro per day, I think), and we were generally happy there, but I'd advise new visitors to Barcelona to pay a bit more and try and stay within the tourist area of the city, the Hesperia tower was hardly 'convenient. 
A tip for the frugal, beware of having breakfast and dinner at the Hotel, the prices could easily multiply the cost of your stay! There are a couple of cafe's and a supermarket nearby on the housing estate (turn right at the hotel entrance, then right again, then left (you will see them).

We did experience the minimally helpful staff upon arrival (which was a big surprise in a 5* hotel), but later we asked another person for advice and he was very helpful.

In brief, the hotel served us well, with excellent, quirky quality at the offer price we paid, but it was not very conveniently located. I did object to paying 24 euro a night for parking so far from the city though. It would have been nice to have ate there, but frankly the prices were excessive.

Wi-Fi was available in the room for free, but you need your own laptop, otherwise it's 5 euro for 15 minutes!! or 12 euro per hour in the lobby. We were oferred 15 minute free however when I expressed horror.",4,2010,09,17
30,What a Fabulous Hotel !!!!!!!!!,"We booked a hotel with lastminute.com and decided to go for the secret hotel....after filling up the details and paying it off you get to know the name of the secret hotel...and viola ...we got The HESPERIA TOWER HOTEL IN BARCELONA. This was a dream come true....brilliant hotel...very clean...very modern....very spacious room and fab shower...and what a fantastic view.....high up on the 16th floor....wow..... We read the reviews of this hotel and were pleased with the rating for this hotel. The following are some tips:

The metro is only 2minutes away from the hotel on foot.....Brilliant!

Buy the ticket that says 10 dia...i think. worth it...you can use it for metro and bus too.

There is a free shuttle service  from the hotel to Placa Catalunja at 10.30 am and two other different times...just be infront of the hotel entrance ten minutes before just to make sure you find a place on the van since it only takes around 12 people.

When you go out of the hotel turn to the right ....walk and turn right again...there is a coffee shop.....bread etc.

Just to let you know there are no coffee and tea appliances in the room.....mini bar is not free and we had no iron board inside the room. 

There is nothing much next to the hotel just a hospital....very quiet....for us this was perfect since after a whole day out we wanted peace and quiet.

It only takes 3O MINUTES TO ARRIVE TO PLACA CATULJANA...and i calculated the time with the shuttle bus and this took the same time....believe me the time will pass so so quickly.

We travelled with Ryanair from Malta to Girona...as soon as you get out of the airport there is one bus waiting to take you to an area in barcelona- free of charge...time taken ...2hours.....pleasant drive...once you arrive at the end of the drive either take a taxi ...only 12-15 euro or take the metro which is right opposite this bus terminus which will take you to Hesperia hotel.If you hire a car you can park it opposite the hotel on the left hand side instead of paying 20 euro a day for the hotel private parking. Gold Car are the best to hire a car....So so cheap.

Hope you find this review helpful...if you need to ask more questions my email is xcherx2003@yahoo.co.uk

I will def go back to Barcelona and stay in the Hesperia Tower.",5,2010,09,13
30,Great hotel.,"Great hotel, was worried it was too far from the main city but the metro is over the road so no problems there.  There is a little bar and cafe near the hotel , near the local housing estate, we felt very safe walking around the hotel at night but must admit there is not alot to do near it.  

The staff were very friendly and helpful when we checked in and for any other problems, i think there was a shuttle 3 times a day to the city but we just took the metro and got a Barcelona 3 day pass which gives you discounts and free travel on the buses and Metro/Trams.

Our room was on the 10th Floor and room was lovely and also had a very big walk in the shower which had a hand held shower, fixed over head shower and a power shower. 

A bit out the way as i said but easy to travel to and from city centre and attractions just make sure if you want to eat without having room service at night to eat well before you head back, though the hotel has 3 resturants to choose from.",4,2010,09,08
30,"Great room, excellent breakfast, metro very near and taxi cheap if sharing.","We stayed here for six nights at the end of August/September 2010.  The hotel is 20 mins away by taxi from the airport and the same distance to Placa Catalunya at the top of the Ramblas.  The hotel provides a courtesy bus to/from the airport and to Placa Catalunya and to Gava beach.  However the times may not coincide with your itinerary and the bus does get full so get there 10 mins early and queue up.  A taxi into town is about 12-15 Euros and from the airport to the  hotel about 20 Euros although cheaper on the return journey.  

The room was lovely  and spacious with great views over Barcelona and a separate bathroom and dressing area.  Huge shower with a variety of jets.

The buffet breakfast is excellent and goes on until 10.30 (11 at weekends) so you can have a lie in.  Food and drink in the hotel is a bit pricey and there isn't much else nearby apart from a supermarket, an electrical superstore and my friends said there was a cafe nearby.  The Metropolitan Spa (2 min walk at the side of the hotel) is very good and reasonable prices for treatments which you can book directly with them.  Alternatively for 12 Euros you can book through the hotel and have direct access from the hotel to all the spa facilities.",5,2010,09,08
30,Well presented Hotel with helpful staff,"Most people have pointed out the bad points about this hotel such as the location (about 30 mins via metro to the centre) and pricey entry to the swimming pool. Its worth noting that when using the spa it is mandatory to wear flip flops and use swimming caps in the pool which you can rent for an extra charge. Other then that I can only really confirm what most people are saying and that is to ignore the bad reviews as you cannot fault the quality of this hotel, the rooms, and the staff there. My favourite thing about staying in this hotel was probably waking up to the fantastic views right across the city. From the 17th floor (which we stayed on) you could even see La Sagrada Familia in the distance. The free shuttle bus service to the centre and to the airport was also much appreciated.",4,2010,09,08
30,wonderful hotel however have to pay for pool use?,"The Hespira is a five star hotel which we got at a cheap rate through lastminute, a bit deceptive with the photos as you have to pay to use the pool in the fitness centre in the complex but is not part of the hotel. If you do not want to use a pool and do not mind travelling on the metro (which is fine) i would recommend staying here. A little tip the staff do not offer addvice unless you ask. There are some cafes and a sumpermarket within 500m but you will need to ask for directions as the staff do not tell you this.",4,2010,08,31
30,Fantastic value and quality for a short trip,"I have never written a review, but felt I had to after staying at tis hotel for two days. I read all the reviews before I left and was worried sick about what I had booked. Ignore the negative reviews! This hotel has fantastic links to the centre of Barcelona including a regular free shuttle bus twice daily. The metro was closed but the bus link was directly opposite the hotel. The area is not rough at all. Not glamourous but not dodgy in any way. The hotel staff were really helpful. The rooms were fantastic value. Paying premier Inn prices for a four star in reality, hotel. You cannot go wrong. I would have stayed here for a few days. If you're staying for a couple of weeks, then this might seem inconvenient. A few days or a week, then don't hesitate. I have high standards and only book five star hotels. This did the trick!",4,2010,08,18
30,Fantastic Hotel with great views over the city.,"We booked this hotel through lastminute.com as a mystery hotel and were not disappointed. The hotel is only a short distance from the airport, we had to get a taxi to the hotel (their shuttle bus last dropped off /picked up at 9am at the airport). We wasted quite a bit of time trying to find the correct bus to take us to the hotel and eventually got a taxi. The taxi driver didn't really know where the hotel was and it cost about 25 euros which was a lot considering it isn't that far from the airport to the hotel.  When we arrived at about 12.30pm we were greeted by reception staff who were quite friendly. We were told after going through all the stages of check in (passport details, credit cards, names confirmations etc etc) that there weren't any rooms available. We asked whether we should come back to check in at 3pm and were told 'maybe' and that it would be better if we came back later than 3pm.
We could however leave our bags in a secure room and they kindly gave us a map and pointed out the best attractions and routes around the city. The metro line L1 (red) which terminates pretty much outside the hotel at Hospital De Bellvitage is being repaired for the last three stops at the moment, but there is a free bus services on the other side of the roundabout (which is directly outside the front of the hotel) which will take you to the nearest metro station Av Carrilet. It takes about 5 minutes to the metro on the bus and then from there its 1.40 euros each and about 15 minutes to the Catalunya stop (which is at the top of Las Ramblas).
The metro is clean and wasn't really busy when we used it, however you have to be very careful of pickpockets and we were advised to not be left alone in a carriage as we know people who have had money taken in a situation like that. Having said that, we had no problems and could normally find a seat for the journey. 
We spent a great afternoon on Las Ramblas and eventually got back to hotel at about 5.30pm. We checked in easily and were given a very nice room on the 23rd floor (an exec room not a deluxe like we booked, score!). The lifts are very quick and quiet and we liked the touch screen podium to control the lift . Our room was simply amazing. The view was unbelievable, we looked out over the city and could see the Sagrada Familia (It was about the size of your thumb nail but it was there!), Mt Tibidabo, the Olympic Stadium area, the marina and much more. I can honestly say that the view we had completely made up for the distance you had to travel on the metro. Having said that, if we were on a lower floor or on the other side of the hotel we may not have been quite so pleased looking toward the airport, but I don‚Äôt know. 
The room had its own dressing area / bathroom. The shower was amazing after a long hot day walking. The room itself was large, clean and we had a kingsize bed which was quite firm, but not as rock solid as the Premier Inn at Manchester Airport on the way there! We had a mini bar that was fully stocked but over-priced, as you would expect in such a hotel. 
We didn't eat in the hotel because of the price however there is a little street of shops and cafes and mini supermarkets nearby were we stocked up on breakfasts food and drinks. When you come out of the hotel walk past the media market and turn right walking towards a little church, before you get there the shops are just on the left hand side. We went at about 7pm on a Friday night and there were still some shops open and we were able to get all sorts from there at really cheap prices, well worth stocking up there before a day in the city centre with its inflated prices.
We checked out on Monday morning about 7.45 am to get the shuttle bus to the airport at 8.20 am. We were told we had a charge for our room of 4.50 Euros and did we use the mini bar etc which we hadn‚Äôt and the receptionist wiped the bill quickly without fuss. 
The shuttle bus is quite small and can only fit about 12 people on it, it is about 10 minutes from the hotel to the airport, however he dropped us and everyone else off at Terminal one and we had to make our own way to Terminal 2 (Ground Floor t1 ‚Äì t2 airport shuttle bus which is free or by taxi) which was another 5 -10 minutes. 
Overall the hotel was lovely, clean and modern and although it was pretty full it still felt spacious. The staff where quite friendly and most could speak English quite fluently. I would stay here again but only if we could get a similar room because the view was just fantastic.",4,2010,08,18
30,"Very good value for money, considering the price we paid","The hotel is very good value for monye, not situated in the center of Barcelona, but the tube is just a hundred meters from the hotel, and is very convenient to join the center of Barcelona. The view from the rooms is impressive.",5,2010,08,16
30,A funky hotel that we will definitly visit again,"Loved this hotel and I am very sure we will visit Barcelona again. This hotel will be at the top of my list. Can not believe the recent reviews here. Like many reviewers we got an excellent deal from lastminute.com for ¬£50 per night so excellent value. We decided to upgrade to a Tower club room for an extra 60 euro per night. This gave us breakfast, complimentary access to the metropolitan spa (worth 12 euro if you have to pay) and unlimited snacks and drinks as well as a 23rd floor room with beautiful views of the city. We also appreciated the daily chocolates and water. We dealt with various members of staff throughout the hotel. We found most of them to be excellent and very helpful.
The bedrooms are a very unique design with lots of space. The bathroom includes twin sinks and a power shower that we really enjoyed as there was no bath tub.
Behind the hotel is a cafe and small shop if you need to buy snacks , water etc.
Many people complained about the distance to the metro but as it closed until August 22nd a free shuttle bus stops at the roundabout in front of the hotel to take you to the next open metro station. This operates every few minutes throughout the day until approx. midnight. The journey into central Barcelona can take upto 30 minutes but this is not a chore. It is worth while making the journey for a superior hotel in a very quiet location. As seasoned travellers we appreciate a good nights sleep and this hotel did not disappoint.
As we spent 7 nights here we didn't spend every minute of the day in the city and appreciated the occasional spa or a glass of cava (beer, wine coffee etc) and international papers in the Tower Club. The Tapas available in the evening were uninspiring and repetitive but a welcome snack. Breakfast was excellent and available to 11.00am each morning.
Great hotel.Great Holiday. Thanks Hesperia",5,2010,08,15
30,Great if you can get a good deal!,"I spent a couple of nights at the Hesperia Tower, having got a rather good deal via Lastminute.com (¬£90 for two nights!). The hotel itself is pretty nice - from the outside it's not particularly pretty, but the standard of the interiors and the view are both impressive. I found the staff to be pleasant though you have to ask if you require something as they're not ones to volunteer information (the wi-fi, which is free and has good signal strength throughout, is passworded, and you need to get a password from reception, which they didn't inform me of at check in). All the staff I dealt with spoke excellent English, and I also heard one of them speak French fluently.

The location might be an issue for some people but if you're like me and leave the hotel all day to explore, coming back in the evening, it's not a problem. If you want to be close to the centre of Barcelona and come and go as you please, or return late at night after the metro has stopped, this hotel won't suit you! At the time of writing until (from what I could gather with my limited Spanish) September the metro isn't running as far as the hotel but there is a replacement bus service from the current final stop on Line 1, Av. Carrilet, which is well-signposted, free, and leaves from virtually outside the hotel (the normal metro stop is a few minutes' walk across the hospital car park). The metro takes 20 mins or so to reach central Barcelona and the trains are air-conditioned, clean and cheap so not a hardship. I can see taxis being fairly expensive as it's a bit of a distance to the centre, and I found no information about the shuttle bus anywhere (I guess you have to ask but I wasn't planning on using it). If you're not happy with the prospect of using public transport to get around, I would stay somewhere else.

The rooms as noted are beautifully furnished, of a good size, and the beds are comfortable - well up to 5* standard. The bathroom was especially impressive and luxurious. However the quirks of the hotel (the lack of proactive service, the weird lift system, the location, and other minor niggles) mean that I can see why some people have been disappointed - if I had paid the standard price, especially for one of the more expensive rooms, I think I would have found it more irritating. The hotel is billed as 5* but in my opinion it's more like a high-end 4* hotel, albeit with 5* quality rooms - perhaps this is where some people's expectations are being dashed (it isn't the same quality as the well-known luxury 5* hotels - but then it doesn't cost nearly as much as those!). But if you can get a good deal - and this is a business hotel so the summer is basically off-season for them, so they seem to do a lot of offers around this time - and manage your expectations and don't mind a bit of travel into the centre then I think you will be more than happy. For the equivalent of ¬£45 a night I was very pleased! I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends if they could find a good deal online and fancy staying somewhere a bit different and nice.",4,2010,08,15
30,The Gurgling Jacuzzi,"Booked a duplex suite, on the basis other reviewers, commented suite clients were treated 'better', umm i don't think so, arrived 3 pm, after a great deal of key tapping our room was allocated 25th floor( no intro to hotel spa, rest, etc),  great view, of city and water, even though hotel is only a few years old, the wear and tear, is quite extraordinary, tiles , 1/2 cm out, every panel scratched , air con entrances black oil stained,  scarey holes in shower, but nonetheless good size room, .
After a pleasant view of city..that afternoon, and a meal off site, we retired, the power blinds, of either room adjoining are enough to wake the dead, but the best or the wrst is still to come, the jacuzzi's alongside bed. and it has air rush's and massive gurgling err 0230am,,,lovely and relaxing...er not..., 
you get the jist,
buffet meals 22 e, nice and steady, ie you get what you pay for.. bests ervice here from whole hotel..dark waiter with glasses, top drawer...
otherwise, think , premier inn,,style...with afew nice bits,,,gym was good, technogym equipment,...still no help,.,.from anyone,Tower suite, buffet great fridges, ie cold beer,overall a good value out of town hotel, so expect that type of traveller, value over style, and certainly nil by service, asked for phone charger er not, asked for shoes to be cleaned errr 5 attempts, asked for anything err give up.,.",3,2010,08,10
30,Totally extortionate and to be avoided,"I booked this hotel through last minute. com and I realised on arrival what a mistake I had made.  Although the hotel is extremely clean, the staff are unfriendly and generally unhelpful.  
There was no information in the rooms about attractions in Barcelona or transport or indeed the facilities in the hotel itself.  I never saw the leisure centre which charges 12 Euro for the use of the pool.  The bar in the hotel was not open during the month of August for some bizarre reason.  The internet was available for use at a cost of 5 Euro per half hour.  While the hotel stated that the metro line ran from the hotel to the centre of Barcelona, this was not the case during my stay as they were working on the line.  I had to get a bus to the metro which was a little inconvenient.  This basically meant that when you left the hotel, you had to stay out for the day as it was quite inconvenient to come back to head out again in the evening.  The shuttle bus provided was on a first come first served basis hence a significant amount of the guests could not avail of it.  The lifts also operate on a touch screen basis which was clearly not a touch screen as everyone spent about 5 minutes trying to access the lift.  Overall the hotel tried to scam money out of people (25 Euro for a sandwich) and did little to make my stay enjoyable.  I would not stay here again as there are a multitude of fabulous hotels right in the centre that look far more appealing.",2,2010,08,10
30,"Elegant and posh, but bad location","This hotel is all shiny and nice. It is well designed, and is very modern. You can have a nice view from the full length window. The dressing room is huge, and the matress is soft and nice. You can even choose from a range of pillows.

Since it was my gradtuaion trip, they gave us free champagne and strawberries with chocolate dips as a surprise. Very sweet indeed :)

The location, however, is pretty bad. There is nothing nearby, and walking to the metro station + metro ride to attractions will take you around 45 mins, which is quite discouraging, especially under the heat during summer. 

Worst thing - the lobby lounge. After sitting there for 10 minutes I got bitten (probably by flea) all over my legs. I felt so itchy and I told the staff they really should clean the sofa... and the staff responded with 'oh...'

Dont think it worths its price afterall.",3,2010,08,10
30,Comfortable and pleasant hotel,"This hotel is modern and stylish.  Our room was spacious and well air-conditioned. The king size bed and large pillows were very comfortable.  Also, the jet shower was very welcome.  

The hotel isn't in the most attractive area but it was very quiet and we didn't feel unsafe as others have mentioned.

We found staff in the hotel to be polite and attentive.  For example, I managed to mess up the safe in the room and the matter was sorted within ten minutes.

We were disappointed to learn that the nearby metro station was closed during our visit but were still able to take a bus to Placa de Espanya and then the metro and be in central Barcelona within thirty minutes, which didn't bother us.

We often had a drink in the lobby bar on returning to the hotel at night, which was pricey but it is a 5* hotel so we expected such prices.

All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Hesperia Tower and would recommend it to others.",4,2010,08,09
30,"Very good but let down by quality of food, service and details.","Having just returned from Barcelona I can say that I'm glad to be back in Blighty!

Hesperia Tower is an amazing new concept located about 15 minutes drive from the airport in an area called Hospitalet Lobrigat (Given it's close proximity to a major cancer care hospital) about 15 minutes drive from the centre of Barcelona. The hotel features a Metropolitan Gym (12‚Ç¨ per day), Full size Convention Centre and 3 main, suitably large restaurants; Bouquet, Azimut and Evo (Albeit I couldn't so much as look at the Evo as the floor was closed for the entire month for construction work I believe) there are 2 bars one annexed to the Bouquet restaurant the other behind reception. A very impressive Tower Club conference centre featuring glass walled meeting rooms are also on offer.

The Hotel security/concierge do and excellent job given the amount of pickpockets and petty criminals that prey on opportunity in the city; suffice to say if someone says you have chewing gum/bird poo on your back/butt put up with it and walk on!

On the whole my stay at this hotel was very good but the wind was taken out of my sails by lack of enthusiasm on the part of the staff and an initial mix up with my booking: I had booked an Executive Double/Luxury Double but was assigned a twin. After a minor furore with the receptionist she 'upgraded' me. More demanding guests would not tolerate error and then questioning from a 5 star establishment.  A taxi from the airport costs 20‚Ç¨ minimum and a taxi back from Plaza Catalo√±a should cost no more than 14‚Ç¨ airport or Plaza Catalonia takes about 15 minutes each way (I got stuck in traffic coming from PC and it came to just 10.40‚Ç¨) There are regular shuttles to the city beach and to/from the airport, but if you arrive after 8pm you have to take a taxi to the hotel as there is no shuttle service after this time. The last afternoon shuttle to the town (Plaza Catalo√±ia) leaves at 12:20 then resumes in the evening from around 6pm.

The lifts which service the hotel rooms are probably the fastest, most efficient I have ever encountered but with more than 27 floors to serve they need to be. A total of 4 lifts service the rooms via a snazzy little Star Trek style podium which requires a heavy handed push of the on screen buttons, as one of the security/concierge pointed out with timely assistance, multi touch has yet to make its way to elevator technology! It should be noted that the lifts are air conditioned and on the first visit to my room the AC in my lift was dripping on me. Again not a nice first impression!

I was lucky enough to get this hotel  as part of a mystery package on lastminute.com and I was not disappointed. The views from my hotel room were simply remarkable the hotel is owned by NH Hoteles and part of their luxury Hesperia arm. The fit and finish to the room was really quite impressive albeit the on demand TV/Film service was not working (I had to put up with CNBC my entire stay yet again) The Calla lilies in my room and bathroom died on arrival (nothing to do with me I hope) and were never replaced or even removed (slightly depressing for a first impression). The fit of the bathroom come dressing room come hall was really very impressive. Mahogany wardrobes with individual cupboard spaces reminiscent of an episode of Jeeves & Wooster. With space for everything from socks to sandals and underpants to uniforms and more mirrors than, well a hall of mirrors I suppose! NH's made a wise decision to pipe the TV audio into the bathroom's ceiling mounted JBL speaker system. This allowed me to keep track of my stocks whilst draining the lizard! The internet connection in the rooms was all but non existent, I had to take my Macbook Pro to reception in order to connect. Look closely at the finish of the rooms and details such as the condition of the chairs in the reception lounge you'll notice something... It was finished in a hurry and there's a general lack of attention to detail. Although this hotel is practically complete snagging has not seen a true completion of this hotel and it was still being snagged while I was there.

Room service was prompt and courteously delivered by a handsome chap who looked wide awake despite the fact that it was well after 1am. The food however let the side down. I decided on my return to London I visited my local Wetherspoons (Southfields!) for a Beer and Burger combo to compare and contrast. The quality of the ¬£4.85 Wetherspoons burger which includes a free pint of beer was 10 times better than the 23‚Ç¨ Hesperia room service cheese burger despite the dinky bottles of Sherry Vinegar and Olive oil which were provided. This might be down to the fact that Wetherspoons do an excellent burger for the money or that Hesperia simply charge far too much for the basics...

The buffet food in the Bouquet restaurant again left much to be desired for the price 22‚Ç¨ per person including soft drinks. I especially liked the limitless supply of Serrano ham. Food was good but for the price should have been considerably better.

Buffet Breakfast served in the Azimut restaurant was yet again unimpressive for the price 18‚Ç¨ per person. Service was virtually non existent and staff seemed more intent in getting me to sign for the addition to the room bill than my overall enjoyment of the experience. I purposely sat at an unset table used by a previous guest and no attempt was made to clear it or offer cutlery. Everything from coffee to sugar you have to go and get for yourself. This is where true 5 star hotels like Crowne Plaza, Hilton and Ritz Carlton along with their humble dedicated teams stand head and shoulders above Hesperia Tower despite its height and modern features.

And finally to the bar...Some might say that alcohol clouds your judgement but credit where credit is due. The barman at the Hesperia's reception bar could teach the management and staff  a thing or two! First off he offered more information about the hotel and Barcelona in general than anyone else during my entire stay. Further I text my wife to call me and ask to be put through to me at the bar. I even sat next to the bar phone which was sitting on the bar less than an arm's length away. The receptionist asks the barman if she can put a call through and he tells her how to do it in language even I can understand. So what does she do? She makes me walk across to reception and take the call in reception...that's just lazy! Further credit to the barman, he makes probably the best Caipirinha I've ever had. This is probably because he uses his own secret sugar blend, real Cacha√ßa and the freshest sun ripened limes. A drink which despite everything else makes me want to visit Hesperia Tower again.",4,2010,08,05
30,"Poor service, inconvenient location","Design of the hotel is very interesting, but the location (last metro station with 30 min run from the city center and not transperant taxi service that has no flat rate from/ to the aiport even the hotel is located within 5 minutes drive from the aiport that you can see it from your window- they charge you depending on your value, sometimes its 20 euro which is minimum, sometimes it can be almost 30 euro..) all that makes it inconvenient to stay in this hotel. Nice design does not compensate the negative part - poor service. We arrived with the night flight and showed up in the hotel at 7:30 in the morning. As being a member of nh-hotel (Hesperia is the one from the chain) I can ask for the early check-in so I did in advance informing the hotel, in the morning I was given a room on the 7th floor very dirty and not prepared for the guests: apart from the dust which was everywhere I found the dirty socks in the bedside table also there were no toilet amenities at all except for that attached to the wall in the shower with some kind of soap. I claimed, so instead of changing the room we were visited by the hotel attendant who checked the socks and invited the room service manager ( arrived accompanied by 3 persons when my husband was already in bed) who took the socks out saying there were no other rooms available to change at that morning. As we were tried from the night flight we decided to stay, but when we left for the city visit we descovered the room was not cleaned even after.. 
So, my reccomendation would be to book a hotel either right at the aiport if you are travelling with an overnight stay in Barcelona, or to stay in the city center because they charge you the same amount anyway for the taxi transfer which is apx. 25-30 euro.  We booked a hotel right in the heart of the shopping street on Gracia. The hotel name is Eurostars Bcn Design, which is opposite  Mandarin Oriental. The hotel has very interesting design also the open terrace on the roof with a wirlpool and sunbeds and its  right in the city center! You can check my report on this hotel with the relevant pictures.
I didn't book the same hotel as we were arriving and leaving the next day at 6 a.m.",1,2010,08,01
30,Friendly and Stylish Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful, we were moved to this hotel a couple of weeks before due to an overbooking, we were not disappointed. we stayed here for 5 nights and it was amazing!
This hotel offers a free shuttle service from the airport, be sure to check their website and ring them when you arrive at the airport so they can get the shuttle to you. It's only 10 minutes from the airport so you can get settled into your room in no time at all. 
The room was amazing, curtains that close by a switch at the side of your bed and a window that covers the entire side of your room with great city views. The bathroom is outstanding, excellent shower, lovely free toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, moisturiser, toothpaste, toothbrush, razor and shave gel!) along with the fluffiest dressing gowns I have ever had in a hotel...
The staff are very friendly and recommended restaurants, marked out directions on our map and even leant us a travel adaptor.
This hotel is about 25 minutes from Barcelona city centre but there is a metro stop 2 minutes from the hotel  and even a free shuttle service to the city centre during the day. There is also a supermarket just around the corner for getting cheap bottles of water before you hit the city centre or beach :)

We didn't eat in the restaurants or drink in the bars as there were so many in the city centre that we wanted to try but they did look very nice for a special occasion!
We also didn't try the spa area as we preferred to get out and see barcelona but it did look nice!

This is a great little hotel and a lot cheaper than many in the city centre and I would definitely stay here again!",5,2010,07,31
30,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. Hotel, rooms, service was great. Would definately recommend. Only downside was hotel is about 30 minutes away from Barcelona town center but they have a free shuttle service in the morning and evening.

Enjoy and have fun.",5,2010,07,30
30,Panoramic views in an excellent location,"I have just got back from a six day stay in Barcelona. I chose the Hesperia Tower primarily due to its close proximity to a metro station and partly as it looked luxurious and modern - exactly what I wanted after a long day of sight seeing in the 30 degree heat!

Our hotel room was absolutely beautiful - king sized bed, lovely bathroom including a hydro shower and panoramic views of Barcelona. This hotel is not right in the heart of the city but is literally directly opposite a Metro station. From this line you can ride straight through to the city centre without changing in a matter of about 15 minutes. The metro is efficient, cheap and safe - a perfect way to get around the city. We bought a ten trip travel card at a price of around 7 euros which you can also use on the citys extensive network of buses.

As well as visiting the well known attractions and cultural allures of the city, I would highly recommend a visit to the beach and also a trip to Nou Camp - home of Barcelonas football team. We went on a tour of Nou camp which was undeniably spectacular. You get to tour the whole stadium as well as experiencing an interactive museum charting the history of the club - a great day out for 19 euros each.

Food wise I'd recommend venturing down the side streets of Las Ramblas, we found an impeccible modern tapas restaurant called Bar Lobo - they serve the best mussels in cream! - the food is delicious and not too expensive. La Boqueria food market is another must for food lovers and also an excellent free activity if you are on a budget.

Overall I loved Barcelona and would definitely stay at the Hesperia Tower again. Our stay was impeccable and the location for us was just perfect. All the staff spoke excellent English and the hotel was very modern and clean inside. 

If you want a luxurious hotel in a quiet location with excellent transport links then this is the hotel for you!",5,2010,07,27
30,Quality Hotel with 5* Luxury,"Depsite the mixed views on this hotel I booked for my friend's 40th birthday.  I got a great deal through lastminute.com as I booked it as a mystery hotel.  The hotel is worthy of its 5* rating and lived up to our expectations.  The room was big and comfortable and the bathroom was very plush.  The hotel is 2 bus stops (No 46) from the hotel and a 15 minute metro ride into town.  We purchased a 3 day travel ticket before we went which was very cheap and can be used on the metro, buses and trains.  We had a room on the 13th floor with great views of the city.  We booked room only so beware - one breakfast cost us 49 euros for two people!  The choice was vast however and of a very high standard.  We did not use the spa (12 eoros per day).  There are a few bars and a supermarket to the right of the hotel.  Some staff were really helpful but one of them could not tell us the times of the buses to the airport when we checked out (there are limited shuttles from the hotel). All in all I would recommend this hotel to travellers.",5,2010,07,25
30,FANTASTIC HOTEL FRIENDLY STAFF,"We have just returned from this superb hotel on the outskirts of Barcelona.  The room was great with a well stocked mini bar, the view across the city was magnificant.  The dressing room was awesome with an extremely powerful power shower.

Defintley a 5 star rating.",5,2010,07,24
30,"A bit out of the centre, but a fantastic hotel","My partner, 18 month old son and I visitied in june 2010, following a 50% offer via Travelzoo, an amazing ¬£65 a night. It is about 20mins from the centre of town on the red line, then a 3 minute walk to the hotel, so not close but manageable and the station 'hospitat' has a lift.
We were instantly welcomed by the porter who took our luggage, the hotel lobby is gorgeous, very modern and stylish. Our room was quite high up, 14th floor I think, with a view away from town. But very nice, a standard size, but with a separate black marble wash room with luggage cupboards, toilet and shower off it, all pristine. We requsted a travel cot and it was made up ready. The only thing missing was a kettle, but sure they'd have sent one if needed. Breakfast was included and gorgeous, lots of choice and a high chair for our son. Staff were very polite and not at all snobby towards a child being there. There are free coaches to the beach and airport, although timings aren't great: there was nothing to get us to the airport for our 7pm Heathrow flight, so we had to get a taxi.
Our only gripe is that there is no outdoor area to have a drink - it is in an industrial/hospital area.
If this was full price I don't think we'd stay again; we opt for a more central hotel instead, but for the price we paid or maybe slightly more we'd dtay again.",5,2010,07,24
30,"Lovely hotel in quiet area, slightly away from centre but with great transport links.","I booked a 3 day stay in Barcelona, planning to book a hostel for my time in order to save on expense (more money to spend in Zara!). A few days after booking my flight i received a Travel Zoo email advising me of a special rate of 60 Euros a night for this 5* hotel and i couldn't resist.  The hotel is about 20 mins from the main areas of Barcelona (Catalunya etc), however the metro stop is a 2 min walk from the hotel and to be honest, a sit down in an air conditioned train was actually bliss after a day of walking in 34 degree heat! The area is also very quiet, although there were no ammenities in the area that i was aware of - this led to me paying 20 euros for a salad and coke on the final day (not cheap but then what i expected from a 5* hotel - equally a glass of wine was 6 quid, similar to any central London hotels)

The room was lovely - 2 seperate areas, one for the bedroom and the other for dressing and showering. The black and silver decor was also very nice and there were plenty of comforts such as a dressing gown, slippers and body products. 

The lobby area and bar was also beautifully decorated and a lovely place to relax in with a glass of wine, after a long day of sightseeing.

I've noticed a few reviews on here about customer service - i would say it was average to good. People assisted wherever needed, however nothing was particularly memorable. The exception would be the bar staff who were attentive and helpful both to myself and the other customers.  I also concur that i didn't see a shuttle bus which is touted on the website as a perk, however that may be because i had no use for it and wasn't looking for it. 

Overall if i went back to Barcelona (wich i would as it is truely beautiful!) and there was a similar deal on the room rate, i would have no reservations in returning to this beautiful hotel.",4,2010,07,17

I telephoned reception immediately, and they said I could stay in 1311 and that they had fixed the ""system"".  However, someone later came knocking on my door with a key for 1311!

30,"Beautiful Hotel, Terrible Service and Staff Standards","The hotel was beautiful. It is not really in Barcelona so you must take their shuttle, or the subway train. They have a restaurant (Evo) but it's ~$350 for 2 people (you can do better in the city). The lobby is very modern and clean. The rooms were fabulous; however, the staff was consistently C-level in service. They attempt to present ""5 star service"" by being stuffy and un-accommodating. If you want ice, you better go down the elevator and get it yourself. Housekeeping will not do this, and room service charged $5/trip to your room. They share a pool with a community (private) 'spa & gym'. They give you a difficult time getting tokens (required to enter the 'spa/pool') and give you one a day because it costs them 12 euros. (Not the customer's problem). Sunday's everything is closed, including their own restaurant. Don't bother asking where they recommend you go, they don't seem to know anything in the city. ***On the other hand, we also stayed several days at Hotel Claris. Claris was older therefore not half as nice aesthetically; however, their staff was amazing and could direct you anywhere you'd like to go. For presentation and if you want to impress someone or are indifferent about service, stay here. Service needs revamped and standards with staff need reassessed. If you do stay here, you must stay in a suite. The suites are amazing, and the front desk told us they treat their suite members with preference over 'standard guests'. (A five star hotel SHOULD treat all guests equally. A bit stuffy. Advice: you can have class and impress while being personal and accommodating.)",4,2010,06,28
30,"EasyJet had to put us up after our flight was cancelled, and they chose this hotel","This hotel is close to the airport, so that is the reason for EasyJet's decision.  We were travelling with 40 secondary school students, and after some hassel with the desk staff because they hadn't had the paper work from EasyJet (at 4 in the morning!!) we all got into our rooms at 5am.  The kids (and we) were  VERY pleased with the rooms.  As you can imagine there were 12 and 13 year olds trying out the toiletries, ordering room service and running about in the plush bathrobes provided gratis by the hotel.  It was very lux, and if you need something near the airport, I would recommend this hotel in a nanosecond!

Not only did we get breakfast and lunch, but we also were given a little box lunch for dinner on our departure for nothing.

It is a beautifully appointed hotel.   However, if you want  something more in the centre, then look elsewhere.",5,2010,06,20
30,Execellent customer service!!,"We were pre-cruisers and it was our family's first time to Europe. Hesperia Tower definitely gave us a great first impression!  The hotel itself is very new..we stayed at the building next to the tower, which is an apartment suite(and I got a great deal online for only 66USD a night!). We arrived at 10am in the morning and the hotel rooms were all full at the time..so we couldn't get an early check in.  However, the customer service rep offered to keep our luggage for us so that we can start exploring Barcelona.  Even though the hotel is quite far from the center of Barcelona, travelling by metro is very convinent. The metro station is just a 2 min walk from the Hotel and it takes around 20min to get to the central.  

The gentleman at the reception area is the nicest guy ever..he didn't charge us an extra person fee and didn't force us to pay for an extra bed!  This hotel provides free internet access as well..which is rare in Europe!! We would definitely stay here again!! Highly recommended!",5,2010,06,18
30,"Far from the center, but very convenient to the metro","The hotel is a GREAT value.  For this price you may get an old worn noisy hotel in the center, or stay here and use the metro - the stop is literally across the street.  It is ultra-modern, very safe, very quiet, very clean and very comfortable.  Just what I needed after hours of sightseeing Barcelona!

Internet was free of charge in the rooms.  The shower was awesome, but it appears that they have a water softener, so if you have sensitive skin, be aware of that.  Didn't try the restaurants, the bar, so can't comment on that.  The metro ride takes about 30-40 min into town by metro.  The stop is very close to the building, and the metro is convenient, clean and safe.

However, if the purpose of your trip is solely or predominantly to party or go to the beach, I would not recommend this place, as it is obviously too far from the city and beaches.  I went out only one night (which was awesome), and the cab back to the hotel charged less than E15, which was reasonable.",5,2010,06,02
30,Don't bother..,"The reception staff were sullen and unfriendly... The rooms were beautiful and kept nice and clean but the location is not great. There is a free shuttle bus to town but it is not regularly throughout the day. It said on the website there was free airport shuttle bus but again, this is not regularly throughout the day so we had to get a cab to the hotel. 
The staff were not particularly helpful... when asked for some ice and lemon (for drinks in our room), they tried to charge us 5euros for the ice and refused to cut the lemon up but provided us with a knife! Why they couldnt cut up the lemon for us in a 5 star hotel- i do not know! I did not feel they made us feel welcome.
There is a spa attached to the hotel which has an indoor pool but you have to buy 12euros to enter.
Overall it is not best hotel for leisure visit due to its location and staff.",2,2010,05,25

I stayed at the Hesperia Tower with 10 friends and family members, including children. The hotel is very well appointed and very clean ( that means a lot to me). The service at the desk was sketchy. One woman with a short haircut was particularly unpleasant. Their were other staff members who provided good service. The biggest problem was the hotel's shuttle service. Their was only one bus, completely unreliable. Also the hotel is FAR away from La Ramblas, you must take a cab or long train ride to get food. The hotel is clean and the rooms are spacious. I basically enjoyed the stay",4,2010,05,21
30,Avoid at all costs unless you are desperate !!!,"This is undoubtedly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.  Wild horses would not persuade me to return, even if offered free accommodation !  On arrival, the sullen receptionist could not find the reservation.  The room she allocated turned out to be already occupied - luckily by my mother in law.  No apology given when asking for another room.  This room stank of cigarettes, despite being a No Smoking floor.  Meanwhile, my in laws found themselves locked out of their room as ""our"" (their) room key had been cancelled.  The phone did not work in our room and despite asking for it to be mended, it never was in 4 days.  We declined the Evo restaurant at 135 Euros per head minimum, before drinks or tax and opted for the main restaurant.  But no, this was closed.  So we had to eat at the bar, which offered pizzas and hamburgers.  This being a 5 star hotel, this was unacceptable. We had driven from England so used the valet service which was so useless, my husband ended up parking and retrieving the car in the end.  We found ourselves locked out of our room 3 times, for no reason, and no apology at any time.  As our phone was not working, we had to return (from the 21st floor) to reception each time to get help.  We were in Barcelona for a family wedding and my 85 year old mother in law struggled with the trendy computerized lift system.  On the final morning, we gave up waiting for the bell boy afteer 20 minutes - my husband went to reception, found 3 bell boys standing around, and helped himself to a trolley and brought it to the room.   We also found the breakfast Tower room closed, with no explanation.  It transpired breakfast was held elsewhere - we were supposed to be psychic.  For my elderly in laws, this needless to-ing and fro-ing was very frustrating and exhausting.  It was the most infuriating hotel experience I've ever had (and I travel a lot!).  My husband did speak to the Duty Manager on the 3rd day who was apologetic, but the disasters continued until we drove away (never to return!)",1,2010,05,05
30,Shambles,"It started badly. Arrived early and we were informed we could check in. No porter around. In a 5 star then they should be everywhere. I actually don't mind that so didn't bother me. First night woke up at 12am by the alarm. The next night was a Monday. We tried to book into the Evo restaurant but was fully booked and ALL the other restaurants were closed??? My wife and I had to have expensive, bad room service. Thanks. Shower was pretty cool. Took a while to work out but the pressure wasn't great. Plus the shower filled up with water which annoys me. The location is bad and there's nowhere to walk to. The free shuttle into town was very good. Breakfast was good but expensive. Actually everything was expensive as they have a captive audience. Gym was an extra ‚Ç¨12. I don't recommend.",2,2010,05,05
30,"Great hotel, convenient but sterile location","Spent 4 nights, fantastic room and building. Appreciated the shuttles but you have to work around their schedules (i.e. there was a 4 hour gap for airport pick-up around noon...). Bars and restaurants on the expensive side but to be expected for this hotel class. You have to pay to use the pool, which is part of a package.
Helpful and pleasant staff. TV offers 1 american financial channel and 1 british channel.
If you don't take the shuttle to town, there is absolutely nothing to do around the hotel.
Convenient Metro station very near.",4,2010,04,29
30,Quality of hotel makes up for slightly 'out of the way' location,"We booked the Hesperia Tower through Travelzoo and the price seemed too good to be true for what the hotel claimed to be so we were somewhat sceptical prior to visiting.  However, our expectations were exceeded when we got to the hotel.  We figured early on that the hotel was by no means central and perhaps that is why we got such a good price.  We had a fair amount of travelling because we got a super-cheap flight to Girona airport but because we had researched the hotel we were prepared for this.  We had to get into the city centre (vis Barcelona bus) and then use the metro to get to the hotel (which is right at the very end of this metro line).  By the time we got there we were pretty exhausted (I always take an excessively big case so I'd advise a lighter case if you are getting to the hotel via public transport - especially at the hottest time of year!) but upon walking into the hotel you are greeted by a refreshingly cool reception area that has lovely decor and welcoming staff.
Our room was out of this world.  The room itself was massive and had a sofa by the window.  Our view was of the hospital side but this was still a lovely view on a sunny day!  Beside the room was another room just as big which accommodated the shower, toilet and a large sink area and wardrobes...kind of like a dressing area actually.  I could have stayed in the shower for hours it was so good.
We had breakfast included in our deal and the selection was the best selection I have ever had - hot and cold choices of any breakfast food you can think of.  I don't normally bother too much with breakfast but you could not resist here.
Unfortunately we did not find the hotel restaurants for dinner to our tastes and they also seemed pretty expensive so I cannot comment on that.  I was unwell one evening so we had no choice but to stay in for dinner and order room service and the only thing I liked was a plain pizza (but I am a fussy eater so perhaps that's no measure of the choice - menu was quite limited though) and that was quite expensive for what I got.
We did not use the complimentary leisure facilities next door as we were out and about all day every day.  
We stayed for 6 days and the commute (about 20minutes into the centre via metro) 4 times a day (out and back then out for dinner and back) did get a bit tiring so I wouldn't stay here as a tourist for more than about 10 days or you'd maybe start resenting it.  But the quality of the hotel at the price we got it more than made up for the commute.  Plus being so far out meant it had a tranquil 'holiday' feel as opposed to the usual 'city break' bustle.
If you want to go out for nights out you also need to consider this as last metro train is midnight during the week and ten to one on the weekend so we almost missed the last train one night by having a late dinner and stroll along the harbour area.
I would definitely stay here again as it was a great out of the way location but within easy reach of the city centre and the facilities and quality were just incredible.  So long as you go expecting a bit of travelling (not just the one or two stops you expect from a city break) then you will be satisfied here.",5,2010,04,13
30,Great Hotel,"This hotel is a  5 star and I have stayed in some great hotels in the past. The rooms are gorgeous, great bed, ,massive bathroom, electric curtains that keep the light out at all times. Great shower. Very clean.
The only problem with this hotel is that it is literally in the middle of nowhere... You have the metro a 2 minutes walk away which is great but if you want a bottle of water that doesnt cost ¬£3.50 from the hotel u either have to go to the train station vending machine or travel further out. On our last night I was starving and had 2 options, get the metro or pay ¬£30.00 for a room servise hamburger,,,which was lovely but not worth ¬£30.00!
If you stay here u have to be here happy to use the meto frequently during the day and maybe go to a supermarket and stcok up cos there is no restaurants or shops anywhere in walking distance of the hotel.

The number 46 bus from the airport stops outside the hotel- a much cheaper option then a 30 euro taxi at only 1.40.
Also it is a very good idea to get a travel card as soon as you arrived. We got a 3 day travel card that allows you to use all modes of transport for 15 euros and if your planning on staying at this hotel you are going to need a travel card as its the only way out!
 
So to sum i would def reccommend this hotel as it is a gorgeous hotel but only if you dont mind using the metro. The metro is not a problem for me(v easy to use) and my hubby as we are 25 and use the metro alot in london but it does become a bit of an issue if u wish to go out during the day and return to get changed for the evening, as it takes 15-20 minutes to get to catulunya station(la ramblas) I found we stayed out from 10-10pm as it was too much of  a journey to go and come bk to get changed so i didnt get to where my best outfits as i didnt want to wear them during the day!
Great hotel but location is not great!",3,2010,04,05
30,Amazing Hotel with access to city via metro,"On arrival at the airport we took the advice of a previous reviewer and took the 46 bus for 1.40 euroes each. After two stops we arrived at the hotel where we booked into what is an amazing hotel - wonderful architecture and lovely modern rooms with massive shower and a sink each. OK - it is out of town but the metro takes about 20 -25 minutes to get to Plaza de Catalunya on the Red line and a book of 10 tickets costs 7.95. The bar restaurant had a good variety of meals and for 5 nights we paid just over 300 euros for food and wine. I don't think that is too expensive for a 5 star hotel. There is a small supermarket round the corner past the media mart, a fruiterers and a pharmacy. We loved it.",5,2010,04,03
30,Outstanding in every respect,"I went to the Hisperia tower a week ago with a new girlfriend I'm trying to impress. We got a fantastic deal with the suite at the top, which was the best room I have ever stayed in. No noise, amazing views, big suite, fantastic. I picked up tickets for the Barca game and they gave me someone else's tickets, came back, swapped for the right tickets (no big deal). They had champagne, strawberries and chocolate compliments of the house - what a touch! The location isn't great, but you subsequently get more bang for your buck. The taxis are always outside the hotel and they take 10 mins - no worries. 

The staff were always very warm, friendly and helpful. Outstanding!",5,2010,03,27
30,"Very Cool Rooms, great quiet escape.  STAY HERE!!!","We just got back today from a 2 night stay at the hesperia tower.  We found a great rate online and went for it.  

The hotel is very modern and very cool.  My wife and I are 25 and really enjoyed the feel of the hotel.  The lobby has got some cool lights, modern furniture, and is a great place to have a (expensive!) drink.

The rooms are amazing.  They have floor to ceiling windows, soft sheets, flat screen tvs, the most AMAZING shower (rain shower head and hydromassage jets from the side), and a nice couch.  Perhaps the best thing about the hotel is how quiet the rooms are.  Although it's on a busy road, there is absolutely no outside noise whatsoever.  A big plus for us as we were both exhausted from the Barcelona Marathon on Sunday.

The location is outside the city.  It is a 16 minute metro ride to plaza de espana.  The metro leaves about every 4 minutes, so it's usually hop right on, grab a seat (as you will be the first on the metro, end of Line 1), and relax for 15-20 minutes before getting to the city.  This was not a hassle for us at all.  In fact, no matter where you stay in the city you'll likely be taking the metro, so it's not a big deal.   It was nice to have a peaceful place to rest in the evening.

The shuttle to the airport is extremely convenient.  However, I'd recommend taking a taxi to the hotel or jumping on city bus 46 (1.40 euro).

We avoided eating at the hotel bc of the prices, but we found a great cafe about 2 blocks away that is open 7 days a week.  It's called 365 dias, I believe.  Go there for 1 euro cafe con leche and pastries.  

Also, be sure to eat at Crema Canela when you are in the city.  We love it there!  Great food and amazingly low prices.  (Make a reservation, or be prepared to wait)

Last note, all the staff were extremely friendly.  We speak spanish, but they all speak perfect English as well.",5,2010,03,08
30,bait and switch with prices higher than the hotel's 29 floors,"We were told we would have a suite which included breakfast. We arrived the hotel was almost empty and we were given a tiny room.  Despite the fact I had a comfirmation stating I was to have a suite, the hotel would not provide me with the ammenties I paid for.  I actually stayed in the hotel a second time two weeks later.  Again a suite was ordered and paid for.  The room I was assigned to was even smaller than the first room. We could add breakfast for 15 euros each which calculates to $23 American dollars. A pricy breakfast.  There were no bell hops. Basically no service. Dinner could be purchased for two at a mere $500.  There was no service. The hotel is ultra modern. There is no service. Considering this is a five star hotel, I would have had better service at a Comfort Inn.  Stay again NEVER. I would not recomment this hotel to an enemy.",1,2010,02,17
30,"Great value, tiresome location","Got this booking through Travel Zoo. Absolutely no complaints about the price, ‚Ç¨75 per night including breakfast and free soft drinks from the minbar. Rooms well appointed with good views towards the city; slightly unusual layout as you enter through the bathing&dressing area. Staff very polite and helpful. The journeys to and from the town centre by Metro are tiresome (but cheap) but you should have factored this in when choosing the hotel. ...it's a reasonable trade off for the price of the room.  Hotel mini bus to town runs a few times a day and also to the airport (but there's a large gap in the airport timetable between morning and evening and the bus goes only to Terminal 1...Easyjet use Terminal 2, Section A). The route 46 bus stops on the main road by the hotel (use underpass to cross wide dual carriageway) and stops and picks up at Terminal B. Runs about every 20 mins. Didn't use the local shops but picked up any bits and pieces that we needed at the Carrefour on the Ramblas.
Eat out in several places but by far the best was the La Luna Restaurant, Carrer Dels Abaixadors 10...takes some finding but worth it.
The 10 journey tickets for the buses and the Metro can be bought at the Metro 150 yds from the hotel (instructions in English on the machines). The cash machine in the hotel wasn't working when we were there but there is one by the ambulance station just beyond the Metro..worked fine.
Wi-fi was free but cut off after 5 mins if you weren't actively searching.",5,2010,02,02
30,The location of the hotel might be good for business travellers but as a tourist location is just too isolated.,"We were looking forward to relaxing at this five star hotel but were disappointed with the location.  Not only is it too far away from the centre but there are no local facilities.  This means that unless you travel to the centre, that meals etc must be bought as ""extras"" at the hotel.  Breakfast at fifteen Euros per person is too much for what you would expect from an average hotel.  We didn't sample the restaurant after being quoted 135 Euros per person for a fixed menu! The leisure facilities are in a building next to the hotel - again twelve Euros per person for the use of the pool adds to the cost of the stay.  What appeared good value for a five star hotel turned out to be an expensive stay because of the extra cost incurred.  This hotel is definitely set up for business users and not for the traveller looking for a city break.",3,2010,02,01
30,Best Hotel Ever Stayed In,Hotel was excellent!!! The room was gorgeous and the breakfast is the best we've ever had in a hotel.Definitely recommend it!!!,5,2010,01,16
30,Wonderful hotel,"I agree with the comments of the last reviewer and would make the following additional remarks

Obtained a great rate thro Travelzoo

Our suite included access to

the Tower floor with unlimited alcohol and snacks throughout the day

free access to the adjoining spa which was excellent ( and would justify the fee payable in any event )

If you waqnt to stay in the centre or object to 25 mins Metro travel do not stay here

Food / drink in the hotel is expensive

Hotel bus will return you to the airport

Would readily stay again at the price I paid",5,2010,01,13
30,excellent,"Used the 46 Bus from Terminal 2 (Easyjet from Bristol), it's easy to find, literally a couple of stops and you can spot the hotel from the bus, you arrive on the opposite side and take the underpass (as highlighted by other reviews thank you).  It was so quick and easy.
Our room was on the 7th floor, good city views and the beds were really comfy, first time in ages I had slept so well in a hotel, not stuffy like some can be. 

Yes it is not central and you may find this a disadvantage it depends what you are looking for, we didn't mind as we've been to Barcelona  before and liked coming back  after a busy day of walking and sightseeing.  The metro is so close it really makes up for any negatives.  It's the end of the line on Line 2.  

Another thing there is no kettle in the room, so if you like to make a tea or coffee bring your own travel kettle.  
Oh yes one last thing the breakfast is incredible, beat the Hilton in London and we found the staff helpful.",5,2010,01,09
30,Very Nice,"I thought i would write a few lines about this hotel,
Its good value if like us you get a deal off the net.
Breakfast is very good and has lots of choice.
Some people have said there are no shops nearby, we found a fruit and veg shop a small super market ,chemist, and a couple of bars . they are round the back of the electric store next to the hotel . Just walk up to the gap between the two blocks of fats and they are down there.
The Metro can become a bit of a drag when you have done twice a day for 3 days .Use the hotel bus to get into BCN we usrd it and got into the centre in 10 mins, also used it to get to the airport and thats only 15 mins.",4,2009,12,17
30,"Excellent Hotel, well worth a stay","We stayed at the Hesperia Tower for 3 nights prior to a cruise and I found it to be an excellent property. I had read the reviews and had minor concerns but the value was excellent. The rooms were very modern, if a bit unusual. You enter the room and find yourself in the bathroom.  The room was very modern and elegant. The staff was very helpful, especially Roger, who assisted with the shuttle to the cruise terminal and any other wuestions we had. The breakfast buffet was very good with a good selection, although I don't recommend the eggs. The proximity to the Metro station made up for it's out of the way location. On the whole, I found this to be a terrific value and an excellent place to stay.",5,2009,12,16
30,its ok,"I agree the staff are not the most helpfull or polite, but the rooms are nice. especially the bathroom shower! There are no shops / restaurants around it, but the metro station is across the road which will take you anywhere in barcelona. Taxi from airport to hotel is 25euro. But there is a free shuttle which takes you back or into the city.",3,2009,12,12
30,Horrible Treatment,While the hotel is indeed gorgeous architect and design the staff is nasty. Even as my family arrived I overheard other guests complaining about the lack of maid service. It took my mom 2hours to get a small bottle of conditioner and after the second time of calling to remind them (which was after waiting an hour) they would purposely hang up on us or simply not answer. Now because we spoke English we got treated a little better but if we spoke Spanish (my family is American Ecuadorian) they treated us like dirt. Also we found an insect (cricket) in our 15th floor room. Don't how he got up there but he was there. The food is over price and not really anything special...I SUGGEST TO AVOID THIS HOTEL.,1,2009,11,28
30,FANTASTIC and trendy and modern!,"I managed to get this hotel at a discounted rate - online offer - but i think i might have just paid the full rate anyhow, it's a really, really funky place. 

Truth be told, it's situated a bit outside the action of Las Ramblas/Plaza Catalunya, which means a 15-20min subway ride in the morning and evening: in the morning from Hospital de Belvitge, then changing lines and ending up @ Drasannes or wherever you need. But it was my first time in europe, and getting on the subway each day was part of the adventure for me. 

I loved Barcelona anyhow and it was such fun to be there, in summer and eavesdrop on the French girls and the English tourists all looking suntanned and happy! :)

The hotel is super-modern, design and style is awesome, and it's a very unique place - looks like it jumped straight out of Wallpaper or Monocle. Room was a good size, bathroom was all black marble and awesome, fantastic rain-type shower, and stylish wardrobe with mirrors all over the place. the bed was comfy and wireless connection generally good. sunset and sunrise from my window was wonderful.

Added, attached to the hotel, there was a fully-equipped gym with a swimming pool, weights training, cycling machines, tanning salons etc for 12 Euroes (if I remember correctly). very convenient for all those trendy spanish who wanted to look good for summer vacation! service was generally good and prompt, and the staff very helpful in helping me get around.

no stores nearby or cafes, so make sure you eat out or bring back to eat in your room. i didn't try the food in the hotel, but i had breakfast served in the room - it was good! but expensive!

Good luck!

Just across the road from the hotel is a parking lot of a hospital, and the subway station (hospital de Belvitge) is right there - no more than 5 min walk away.",4,2009,11,19
30,One of the best hotels ever stayed,"If you like modern hotels, modern architecture and breathtaking views - this is the right place.  The only negative point is that the hotel is in the middle of nowhere, unless you attend an exhibition at Barcelona.",5,2009,11,17
30,Wonderful Hotel - Highly Recommended,"Lovely hotel to stay in, really modern throughout and well designed. We were upgraded for free and given access to the lounge which included free drinks and food in the afternoons/evenings! The rooms were excellent, huge walk in shower and really comfortable beds. Staff were friendly and really helpful with suggestions and directions - they all spoke good english. The location isnt great - but there is a metro stop only 2 mins away, and its only a 20 min journey into the city centre. Would definitely recommend if you're visiting Barcelona for a long weekend/a few days.",5,2009,11,16
30,Great hotel with some exceptional rates,"3 things you need to know about this hotel:

Firstly, as a building and a business, it's a great hotel.  Views are impressive, rooms fitted out to a high standard, good restaurants, staff helpful etc etc.  The sort of hotel where when you call reception for something, they bring it to your door in 2 minutes, rather than asking you to come down.  Definitely five stars.

Secondly, location is not in the City.  It's halfway between the motorway and the airport.  If you have a reason to be here, fine.  If not, it is a poor substitute for being in the city.  Yes, there is a metro stop opposite but there are many many hotels to choose from in the centre.

Thirdly, the rates can be very good.  We paid ‚Ç¨100 per room, including breakfast, free wifi etc.  It wouldn't make me stay here if I wanted to be in the City, but this hotel would charge at least 2x the price in the city centre.",4,2009,11,12
30,Stunning Hotel - Great Service and Facilities,"I was a bit worried about staying here having read some of the reviews, however, I shouldn't have worried.  This hotel is simply stunning.  Definately aimed at business people more than tourists, but it met our needs perfectly.  The staff were always polite, efficient and courteous and I dealt with several different people throughout my stay.  I cannot agree with reviews of terrible service by the front desk staff.  The rooms are spotless and spacious and the views from the top of the building are amazing.  I opted for the buffet breakfast at 15 euros per person which is worth it as there is no where else close by to eat breakfast and it is served til 11 at the weekends, so it is ideal for brunch before a day of siteseeing.  Yes it is 15-20 mins from the centre of the city but the metro is easy, cheap and convenient and the peace and quiet and luxury that you get when you get in is worth is.  And not everything you wish to see is in one place so you are going to end up travelling around on the metro anyway.  I wouldn't want to stay in the centre of Barcelona anyway as it is very busy and noisy at times.  Got a public bus (no 46) from the airport  upon the advice of other trip advisor reviews, which was easy to find and the hotel shuttle back to the airport when I left.  I honestly don't know how people can give this hotel 1 or 2 stars in their rating as the hotel itself is near perfect.  If I returned to Barcelona I would stay in this hotel again and would recommend it to a friend.  Don't be put off by bad reviews, I can only think someone was having a bad day!  If you stay in this hotel you will love it!",5,2009,11,11
30,Not an Airport Hotel,"Arriving on a late flight and leaving on a 6 am flight I ended up at this hotel. Took a taxi there from T1 and was charged 20 euro's for the 5 min ride as this is the minimum fare. Check in somewhat clumsy with staff discussing internal issues in front of me. Room quite nice, only a shower (but a good one). Good comfortable bed, slept great. Upon leaving the hotel at 4:30 am, front desk arranged for a taxi, despite there being taxi's in front of the hotel and I was 'told'  to wait inside. Taxi finally showed up, it was clear to me that the hotel benefits from this arrangement. Then the driver charged me a flat 20 euro's again. This minimum is only for rides leaving the airport not TO the airport, I am not stupid.  This was a ride arranged for by the hotel, couldn't believe they then scam you. Not in the mood to throw a scene in the early am. Contacted the hotel and told them to sort it out. Received a short email saying not much they could do. I  Won't be back.",1,2009,11,01
30,5 star looks faiding fast and service is a nightmare,"I was very much looking forward to my stay at the Hesperia Tower Barcelona and while the location in the middle of nowhere between the airport and the city was a drawback, the 5 star comfort level, designer looks and also excellent service I associate with a deluxe property should have made up for the lack of things to do nearby. Sadly the Hesperia Tower only scored in the looks department and upon closer inspection, even in that department the wear and tear is already obvious - quite sad after being opened for only year years, the wear and tear on the funky furniture is obvious, the windows and floors need cleaning badly etc. BUT, what will really stop me from ever coming back is the lack of service, attention to the customer and ""so what"" attitude by the front desk staff. Check-in alone for two rooms took over 15 minutes (with no one else in line) and we could not get 1 room with twin beds nor 1 with a king - I don't think the gal even tried.
Porter was also not to be seen again after he loaded the suitcases on the luggage car, so we brought them ourselves to the room - no big deal. Bar service despite hefty prices for drinks/food in lobby lacked friendliness and efficiency - we even had to ask for a pen to sign the bill. WORST MOMENT was when upon return from the city (20 Euro taxi fare), we found a puddle of water in the bathroom coming from the ceiling lights. Reminder, we were staying in a 5 star hotel that is only three years old. The front desk staff didnt react surprised, offered to clean it up, and that was it. WE ARE NOT COMING BACK and you may not want to stay here either. Much better properties can be found closer to town with friendly service and where your business is actually appreciated.
p.s. SPA and GYM does not open til 9 am on the Sunday, so we never got to go.",2,2009,11,01
30,Luxurious hotel with the `wow` factor but difficult to find by car.,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my partner, daughter and her boyfriend , courtesy of a special deal with Travel Zoo of 75 euros including breakfast and free soft drinks mini bar.
We loved this hotel and it was well worth the 25 minute metro ride from the centre. The metro tickets were only 7.65 euros for a book of 10 and could also be used on trams and buses. They ran every 5 minutes or so and we had no problem getting back at 2.30am Sunday morning! 
Breakfast was very good but a meal in the revolving restaurant on the top of the building was 135 euros each and the other restaurant was closed at 9.30pm Saturday evening hence our trip into the centre of Barcelona.
Beware eating at restaurants on the Ramblas, they tempt you in with cheap menus but drinks are extortionate - 7euros for a small beer in some! There are much cheaper and better places to the east of the Ramblas.
We flew into Gerona (Ryanair) and hired a car to get to the hotel. Unfortunately the hotel address didn`t show up on the sat nav and we got hopelessly  lost and stuck in traffic jams both from and to the airport . Next time we will use the bus and metro!
Will definately go again as Barcelona is fantastic and there is so much to do, although it is expensive because of the poor exchange rate at the moment!",5,2009,10,29
30,"Excellent value for money, true 5 star, location not a problem","I stayed here with my husband and our parents. We upgraded to Tower rooms which gave us some really nice luxuries including free use of spa and tower room (free snacks and bar) The hotel is ultra modern very funky and trendy. Breakfast was ‚Ç¨15 extra and well worth it. The rooms are very clean, modern and comfortable. The only slight draw back was the relaxed staff(but that seems norm in Spain)! They were friendly and helpful. The hotel has a very efficient and regular shuttle to airport and city. The Metro is across the road and brings you right into the city centre(red line, last stop on way out). We thoughts location might be a problem for us but it was so handy. For what we got it was worth the move out from the city. Super experience, we all loved it!!",5,2009,10,29
30,Fabulous hotel,"What a room, what a view.  I have nothing bad to say about this hotel except the airport shuttle stops at 8 p.m. and they don't tell you that on the internet site, and the shuttle runs to the airport once every 40 minutes.  otherwise beautiful funky hotel with all the amenities you could want and more.",5,2009,10,28
30,Great Hotel,"Just stayed three for 4 days with OH. loved the hotel. We had a deal through travelzoo which gave us free room upgrade, free minibar and free breakfast only for 69 euros a night. Many 1 and 2 star B&Bs charge this rate so thsi was a bargain. Staff spoke good english (especially when compared to how much spanish we spoke when going to their country) and were helpful.

The room was fab. It had a living room and a bedroom with kingsize bed. Both rooms had TV with pay per view content as well as some satellite channel, however there was only one english channel- BBC World. The bathroom was faboulous with a whirlpool bath a shower and two seperate toilets ! The breakfast was excellent with all usual things.

The location is a bit remote from the town centre but i suggest that if you are getting a good deal dont be put off by this. It is 5 minutes walk away from a metro station on L1 (last stop on L1) and the walk is safe with plenty of lighting in the area. L1 line takes you straight to the heart of barcelona in about 20-25 minutes.

Bus also has shuttle service to airport and city centre. Timings very but bus to city centre starts at 10.20 am and last one is 5 pm and there are total of 5 timings between 10 am and 5 pm. The timetable is clearly marked in the reception lobby. There is only one entrace to the main reception so if someone says they were confused with where the bus leaves from please ignore it. Its not hard at all.

some people have complained about the lift, but we had no problems whatsoever. To go to your rooms you have to swipe your card at lift entrance and then select which floor you want to go to. You will then be told which of the four lifts to use. Its very very simple. 

there is a SPA at hotel but we didnt use it. 

Also if a hotel shuttle is not running when your flight arrives or departs, i would suggest not to do a taxi and waste 20 euros. There is a bus no 46 which takes you from airport to the hotel in about 15 minutes and costs only 70 cents (if you have T10 card) or 1.35 euros if you buy onboard. The bus stops at both terminal 1 and 2 and stops in front of the hotel across the road. There is a underpass to taken when coming from the airport while going back to aiport there is no underpass as you are on the right side of the road. hope that makes sense !! The bus had a lot of luggage space and was quite empty both times we travelled, so dont be put of if you have some luggage. 

A final note that the hotel shuttle to and from the airport stops at terminal 1 only and hence may not be suitable if you arrive at terminal 2 (as we did with easyjet). There is an internal shuttle between terminal 1 and terminal 2 but this is even more reason to use the bus no 46. While going back even though we had a hotel shuttle avilable we chose the bus no 46 to avoid this hassle (and also we had spare jouneys on T10 card)..

This is my first review on tripadvisor and hope this review helps someone and gives some useful info.",5,2009,10,28
30,Disappointing for 5 star hotel,"The location of the hotel is remote, although they do operate a shuttle service to city centre.   There is also a free shuttle to / from airport however the service is unreliable and no one seems to know where the pick up point is.   Rooms are excellent, very comfortable and well furnished with a very trendy bathroom.   The service is poor, staff generally unfriendly and unhelpful apart from the odd exception.   The hotel boasts a swimming pool / gym etc but unless you are on their concierge level you have to pay to use it (12 Euros a day).   Breakfast was OK, but lacked variety and not replenished so many of the buffet dishes were left empty.   Restaurants in the hotel are very expensive, particularly top floor michelin star restaurant (120 Euros per person!!).   There are some very local tapas type bars nearby, but nothing else.   All in all we would not stay here again.",3,2009,10,25
30,simply loved it,"i simply loved this hotel.yeah,its a bit far out,but , when your on holiday you are only looking for a bed for the night.metro 2 mins walk away,taxi into las ramblas,13euros,metro,all-day tkt.5.80euros. only problem is ..if your driving,using a sat nav.dont put in 144 via  gran corts,etc.. put in hospital beltvitge.staff were good.i never ate here,so cant comment on food,etc.  but for a wkend in barcalona..fantastic",4,2009,10,21
30,Great Hotel,"Great hotel with friendly staff.... But there was a new receptionist at the front desk and she gave us 2 very wrong details which cost us a fine from the police cause we parked in a no parking zone ( which we were told was ok by this receptionist) and also paying for the minibar ( which we were advised that it was free) . Apart from that, would love going there again.",4,2009,10,20
30,Great Hotel ..Bad Location,"Hotel is funky , modern and very clean. Try and get a room with a view over barcelona and not in the direction of the airport. Rooms modern and clean, breakfast buffet is great with a good variety.

However, it is too far from the centre of Barcelona. It is exhausting when you have had a full day on your feet sightseeing, then having to get the metro back to the hotel to freshen up, then having to get on it again to travel into town for a night out, then travel home on it again!! It takes about 25mins and stops about 18 times, boring!! Wouldnt travel on own late if single female. 

Free shuttle wasnt running from airport to hotel when we arrived and taxi drivers VERY rude so we hopped on a number 46 bus (1 euro 35..bargain!) which stopped on main road next to hotel.
In short, fabulous hotel, bathrooms funky, breakfast great. Distance too far from centre and took us ages to get back from the beach.",4,2009,10,16
30,Excellent hotel - rubbish location and staff,"booked this hotel via priceline's ""name your oen price"",, but was told that we can only get a smoker's room under that category? Pretty upsettign as a start to your holiday. Staff was polite but not as helpful and the level of service does not reflect the hotel's star ratings.  

Hotel is 30 mintues into BCN city centre by metro. waste of time and money. It is also the last stop on the metro - not recommended for single girls, as it can be pretty scary travelling on the metro in the wee hours of morning alone.",3,2009,10,14
30,Stunning Hotel in a convenient location,"We booked this hotel last minute as it was running a special offer on 4 night stays.

Initially we were a little apprehensive as it was further out of the centre of Barcelona that we had stayed before.

Despite this, we had the most fantastic stay. The hotel is situated opposite Bellvitge Metro station and this will get you into the centre of the city in around 20 minutes. (TIP: buy a Barcelona card, this gives you unlimited travel and discounts on may of the attractions) The metro runs from around 5.30am to 12.30 midnight  (from catalunya) so you will have plenty of time in the City.

The rooms were enormous and absolutely breathtaking, we were luck enough to have a room on the 13th floor with views over the Olymic Stadium and Montjuic palace. The bathrooms have double sinks and the most fantastic shower. They were cleaned daily and were impeccable. Free wireless access is available, you just have to request a password at reception.

The main bar and reception are was lovely for relaxing and even has complementary phone and laptop chargers (a really nice touch!).

The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have had and included a huge selection of hot foods, cerals, yoghurt, fruit, bread and pastries, meats, cheeses and spansh omlettes. There was also a good selection of teas and coffees.

We arrived late on a very cold, rainy day and decided to order room service for dinner. This was also delicious, delivered quickly by an extremely polite waiter.

I would return to this hotel without hestiation and would highly reccommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2009,10,14
30,Convenient,"Have a courtesy shuttle to airport
Near a Metro station (walking distance)",3,2009,10,09
30,Perfect for airport layover or stadium concert,"My husband and I flew into and out of Barcelona within 24 hours, and this hotel was perfect for proximity to airport - take advantage of the free hotel shuttle.  Also across the street from the Metro, which we used to go to a concert at the Olympic Stadium the one night we were there. So convenient.  The room was spacious, well appointed, and very contemporary.  Worth much more than we paid - great value found on Travelzoo.",4,2009,10,08
30,"Lovely hotel, rude service","We had saved up for a holiday to Barcelona and got a great deal with Hesperia Tower. Five start hotel outside the main city of Barcelona. Beautiful hotel with great facilities, rooms are very modern and gorgeous views of the city. Unfortunately the service did not match the hotel. We were treated very badly and ignored on servral occasions.
The check-in was rushed even though it wasn't busy, they did not help us with our luggage to the room, did not wish a nice stay ect. We asked for an upgrade and were promised it on several occasions even by the front office manager, but everyday they 'forgot' to block the room.
There is a Tower Club lounge which is advertised to be open from 11am until 11pm, we paid to get access but were not told that it was only open from 5pm until 9pm at the same price! When we went there, it opened late, and no one was there to assit, a nice looking lounge but there were no bottle openers no cups for coffee, glasses for the wine and no assistance. In addition it is also advertised as providing food, however only a few stale biscuits and nuts were provided. When we called down for a ssistance, they took 20minutes to arrive and were very rude and unhelpful.

Overall, a great hotel, I would recommend to go there only IF you get a really good deal do NOT pay full price, it won't be value for your money! Enjoy the hotel but we vary of the rude staff and less then efficient service.",3,2009,10,03
30,Great 5 Star Hotel to return to at the end of a long day of sightseeing but a bit on the far end of the Metro,"Hotel reminded me of staying at the W hotel.  Trendy Chic and comfortable with luxury amenities.   The rooms were roomy by European standards.  The shower, FABULOUS!  Great water pressure and 3 different shower head options (rain shower head, shower head hose/handle and the car wash option with 6 sprays from the wall) and loved how the water drained from a slit in the marble slab.  I never wanted to leave the shower!  The towels and bed linens were luxurious!  Towels thick and soft.  A frosted door separates the bedroom from the bathroom suite and another frosted door separates the toilet from the rest of the bathroom.  Window curtains opens and closes with a push of the bedside button.   A Plush couch even fits in the room without being too cramped.   

Our rooms included breakfast which had a nice fancy spread with variety.  However the spread never changes and can get boring since the same thing is served everyday.
Also offered is free Wi Fi which we didn't have any trouble connecting into from our room on the 18th floor but they will charge you to use their business center which is kind of lame.

Staff was a bit cold and unfriendly but got the job done.  All we cared about was the comfort of a nice room after a long day of walking and sightseeing.  Location could be closer to the center of town but at least it wasn't far from the Red line (last stop on the Red line at Hospitalet de Belvitge) and you only need to cross the parking lot above the metro and the street to reach the hotel.  We felt safe from the Metro at night to the hotel and was able to lug our bags easily as the entire parking lot and sidewalk is paved.  

The hotel also offered airport shuttle to BCN (which we didn't have any trouble taking to return to the USA).  We didn't get a chance to take the shuttle to the hotel from BCN or the drop off to city center at Catalunya from the hotel but it is a nice option the hotel offers.  However, the drop off into the city does not offer a return to the hotel, which is kind of weird but at least it saves you one trip ticket from the Metro.",5,2009,09,30
30,Good hotel to stay off the beaten path and go into the city for some fun,"I stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights.  The hotel staff were kind and friendly, but I found the shuttle service to be a little less than reliable so my suggestion is to have a """"backup plan"""" and start early when you are making arrangement to get to the airport for your return flight.  Also, beware that the shuttle bus is small and it takes guests to the airport on a first come first serve basis.  So, if you are traveling when there are alot of other guests needing to go to the airport, you could run into a problem.  A second shuttle will not go to the airport until it is scheduled to go.  Although the hotel is not far from the airport, it is a good 15 minutes away.  The shuttle is very infrequent compared to the other airport hotel shuttles.  For example, I stayed at the Renaissance on the back-end of my trip and it makes many stops to the airport during the course of the day.  Also, there is a city bus that stops on the street along side the hotel that goes directly to the airport.

The rooms are spaciaous and comfortable.  The layout of the rooms is a bit odd since when you enter the room, you are standing in the bathrrom.  However, the bathroom is attractive.  It does get some getting used to operating the light switches and the shower (I don't think I ever did completely figure out the shower).  You have a card key to turn on the lights.  If the card key in not in place---no lights. The television is a good place to catch up on your Spanish if you no habla espanol since the BBC and the Geographic channel are the only English-speaking channels.  

I did notice housekeeping cleaned my room eventhough I had √§ ""do not disturb"" sign on the door.

The building is really architecturally different from most hotels you will visit.  At night, it is very attractive.  I did not eat at the restaurant, but noticed the menu was very limited.  It is true that the hotel is on the periphery of the city (about 25 minutes), but there is a shuttle that goes into town, a bus, and the  train (""redline"""").  The train is very convenient.  Very dificult to get lost as the Hospital Bellvitge is the very last train stop.  It is actually across the street from the hotel and very safe.

The elevators took some getting used to also.  There was a swipe card system and then you selected a range of floors and then you selected the floor your room was on.  Selecting your floor quickly enough after you swiped was a challenge because the sensor was a little tricky.  If you are not quick enough--you get to try it again because the elevator will not come until you get it right.  At night, you could see the ground underneath your feet by the elevators.  This was neat and unusualy.

There is a neighborhood near the hotel, but you must walk about 3 minutes away and you will see small stores where you can buy fruit, vegetables, water, drinks, etc.  There is a bakery, and small places to eat sandwiches and tapas. So, venture out.  There is a electronics/media store next door in case you forget batteries, etc.

I had the breakfast buffet each day.  There were plenty of choices, but none of the fruit was sweet.  I thought this was unusual since it was summer and fruit is usually sweet, but there is plenty of food for you to get full and start your journey to see so many wonderful sights!",4,2009,09,08
30,cold burgers & confusing lifts,"the service in this 5* hotel is dire. you are best off ordering 1 hour before you get hungry and whatever you do, don't order food from the bar unless you like your food freezing cold. the hotel uses a complicated computerised lift system which will leave the most seasoned traveler completely baffled. it's ridiculous and unnecessary. it's location is awful unless you need easy access to the conference center. you cannot walk anywhere unless you like walking through social housing. I expected at least a local flavor to the food. there is none. no tapas to be found. I tried ordering a simple green salad at one point and they even messed that up. it came coated in what I could only describe as the the brine from a jar of olives, ie the entire salad tasted of salt. 

there are no coffee or tea making facilities in the rooms. there are no baths in the standard rooms. there are no english language tv channels. there is no iron. there is free wifi but it seems to go out of service past 11pm. all of these things may be too common for a 5* hotel but nevertheless are very nice if you are traveling on business.

I have stayed in 2* hotels that I enjoyed more than this place.

I think the hotel has sacrificed good service in favor of trendiness. 

Although it is very quiet and the breakfast buffet was not terrible.",1,2009,09,04
30,Super price-good hotel,"We went with a liitle boy 6 years. We stayed  for 7 nights with the trvaelzoon deal in Hesperia tower. We went every day to the Tropical Beach club. After  complaining with the managher we get every day free to the beach. At 6.00 pm we always take the shuttle service to the centre of Barcelona. The shuttle always in the middle (Place de Catalunya). It takes 10 minutes from the hotel to the centre. The metro last stop of the red line "" Hospitalet de Bellvitge"". The hotel is really a business hotel, good breakfast, many selections. It was free with the package. For the price of ‚Ç¨60 a room including breakfast and beach club, i think we are never see Barcelona cheaper and better then this. For food is Passeig de Garcia a great street with a lot of shops and tapas restaurants. Please stay away from the Ramblas to eat.",4,2009,09,03
30,I'd probably book this hotel again for future visits to Barcelona,"Booked at the last minute, so took a chance and hoped for the best. Before arriving we'd nicknamed it 'Hysteria Tower' but we were pleased that this ended up only being a pun on its name and not a reflection of the service provided.
There is a courtesy bus from the airport (check for times) and the hotel is only about 15 minutes away. The Hesperia is out of town, but there is a metro station nearby (three minutes walk) and a carnet of 10 tickets costs only seven Euros.
The reception staff are efficient, but we found the swipe-card system for using the lift a bit confusing. However, it doesn't take long to get used to and it does ensure the hotel is secure. The lobby design is great, as is the 'spaceship' on the top of the hotel.
Our room, on the 15th floor, had fabulous views, with floor to ceiling windows and was wonderfully quiet. The bathroom is all black marble and mirrors, but nicely designed and there are bathrobes to use.
We used the spa (12 Euros each) and felt that it was worth it - it has a gym, pool, sauna, steamroom, ice-chamber and spa pool.
Left feeling it was a good choice and I would probably book again if I visit Barcelona in the future.",4,2009,09,03
30,Fantastic hotel,"We found this hotel on travel zoo and as it was very good value we gave it a go. Although it is on the edge of the city, close to the airport, there are fantastic views over the city. There is a shuttle bus that collects you from the airport. It also takes you to the centre of Barcelona and to the beach club, all free of charge. The metro is a 5 min walk away.
The hotel is very modern. We were up graded to a superior room which was lovely.
 We loved the breakfast, although my husband was a bit disappointed with his bacon and eggs, but we were only expecting a continental breakfast, so it was a bonus. 
The down side was the price of drinks in the bar, luckily we are not big drinkers!
The beach club (with free towels) was a nice touch, although not 5*, just what we needed after 3 days of seeing the sights.
All in all, well worth the money.",5,2009,08,27
30,Not for a holiday...just a long weekend!,"Beautiful hotel...great room...but not recommended in August, and take plenty of money.
Breakfast was a feast, but cooked variety was of a poor standard, bacon sittng in 2cms. grease, same menu every day, eggs solid and waited for fresh eggs for 20mins one morning only to find the fresh ones had been cooked at least 10 mins and had congealed. No cereal bowls...it's the little things that were distrurbing for a 5star hotel. They introduced a coffee machine on the last morning but it ran out of coffee pouches very quickly and veru few guests could workout how to use it... and the hot milk didn't work!!
We had read that the reception staff were poor but we found then very helpful.
The Hotel is out in the sticks... and taxis in Spain have doubled in price since we lived there 6 years ago.. the Metro is handy but in the August heat not really recommended!
We were there for 10 days and hired a car ....definately needed! The shuttle bus to the city and the airport runs at inappropriate times.. and there was no bus at all to pick us up, a 7min journey that cost 20 Euros in a taxi. No where to eat in the evening within walking distance. We were told we would have access to their beach club, but not that this access would be once only and then pay 30 Euros a day to sit on their beach...!
The building is magnificent, but in other ways it did not reach the 5 star rating... a couple of nights as a business client -yes, but a holiday stay- definately not!",3,2009,08,26
30,not a family hotel,"Just returned from a four day visit, staying in the adjacent 'suites', very well appointed accommodation but with some small, none the less irritating omissions, no kettle, we're British, for goodness sake, we need our tea.  The only English speaking TV channel was Sky news, even the release of the Libyan 'terrorist' failed to interest after the twentieth viewing!  the TV, in the bedroom, was placed in such a position that my partner managed to cut his head on it on the first night. The maid didn't service the room until around 5.00 in the afternoon, just when you wanted to put your feet up, after a very hot day in the City.
I have no complaints about the breakfast, although getting to the restaurant could be a bit of a challenge because of the lift system.  The hotel was very 'clinical',  the washbasins in the ladies toilets proved to be almost too clever, all I wanted to do was wash my hands, but working out how to turn on the taps, in semi darkness, proved to be not an easy task.
The location was not the best, but we did realise that at the time of booking; we booked through lastminute.com and weren't made aware of the courtesy bus service, which we used on our return journey to the airport, making the process far easier.  It was also useful to get into the City centre.
We had to vacate our suite by midday, our flight was not until 10.30 p.m and, other than a facility to keep the luggage safe, there was nothing else on offer, no courtesy room, no showers, nothing, except the opportunity to keep the suite on payment of 10 euros per hour!   I have stayed at hotels, with much lower ratings than this one, and been offered far better facilities.  All in all, it looks very nice on paper, but is definitely more suited to those on expenses.",4,2009,08,23
30,"Very modern 4* hotel with friendly staff, but I won't be going again!","This is a beautiful hotel on the outskirts of town and I am sure that many people who stay there love it - but - it is not nice if you've ever felt worried by heights.  Normally I am fine with heights and looking out over Barcelona was lovely, (I was on the 13th floor - get an even number or you look out over building areas and carparks) but at this hotel you can only get to your floor by swiping your room key by the lifts and are told which lift to take straight to your floor.  The lifts are on the outside of the building and the only other way of travelling between floors is by fire escape - alarmed glass doors and a metal spiral staircase outside of the tower.  The floors and walls are designed to look reflective and/or transparent and made me feel the need to check where I stepped all the time, though you do get used to it.  In the lobby lift area the floor is transparent so you can see the gravel underneath it, and the bathroom area of the room, which you step straight into from the hall is all black marble and mirrors which takes several minutes to adjust to.  It took me a while to realise that the wardrobe was a hanging space next to the sliding mirror in the bathroom, and not in the bedroom.   All in all I found it rather disconcerting and the effect has disturbed my sleep since I've returned, dreaming of lifts with no sides and falling from great heights through disappearing floors!!!
I cannot fault the staff there though.  They took interest in and helped me with any query and everything was very clean and shiny (!!).  
There are a few things which I feel they need to sort out though to deserve their stars -  on the last day of my stay, I booked out in the morning, spent the day in Barcelona, returning as arranged for the airport shuttle bus and was directed to the lobby toilets when I asked for somewhere to freshen up for the flight home.   These were absolutely sweltering and were impossible to use, really letting the hotel down so make sure you don't need them!  - Oh and have the continental breakfast, don't bother with the cooked breakfast YUCK reconstituted scrambled eggs.......... Top floor and other restaurant was closed the whole time I was there so can't comment on them.  Room service the only other option, was very expensive - about ¬£20 for a club sandwich but was well presented and tasty.",4,2009,08,18
30,Lovely hotel - would stay there again,"We booked this hotel with a travelzoo promotion and were really happy with our stay, especially for the price we paid.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it isn't in the greatest location but the hotel puts on handy bus services into town and the hotel is really close to a metro station - we used the metro a lot.  We really enjoyed the beach club, although on our last day when we had to head off for the airport the bus we wanted to take back was full (the hotel puts on two minibus trips back to the hotel in the evenings) which meant we had to wait for the next one, which put us under a lot of time pressure.  The lobby is lovely and the rooms themselves are also very nice - comfortable beds and lovely bathrooms.    We would definitely consider staying there again if in Barcelona.",4,2009,08,18
30,"Wouldn't say 5 star, but make sure you get a good deal!!","Design, and rooms are 5 star OK!! But nothing else.
Just back after a weeks stay with my wife. Dont take a family, its more of a business mans Hotel. Room keys operate the lift- great fun once you get them to work and start to know what you are doing!
It was only good for us as we booked a deal with travel zoo. This gave us an upgrade to a superior room above 15th floor. Good views provided your facing toward the city. Also breakfast- buffet style, not good, hot food often cold and tasteless, and no proper breakfast teas on offer. Included was free access to the BeachClub with shuttle bus. This however, according to the Hotel was only for 1 days access. On showing them the travel Zoo offer it didn't state this and we blagged an extra day, followed by a computer glitch on their behalf we also blagged a third day!
BeachClub was good as expected near pool and sea. They provided sun beds, parasol and towels. Also close to Bar/Cafe with decent food.
As stated by all reviewers the Hotel is not in the city centre but we used the shuttle to Town and the Metro on return, was really good if not a bit hot, although trains well air conditioned. Restuarants closed during our stay so we had to eat in Town about 25 mins away.
Prior to arrival I emailed as I wasnt sure that we were getting a superior room. On arrival we appeared to have been upgraded to a room on 21st floor. According to the room manual this gave us access to the TowerClub and after confirmation with reception staff we duly obliged with the free bar, cold soup, and small Wontons - definately not tapas! We were pleased but I wouldn,t recommend paying the extra ¬£37 night with travel zoo.
The staff were not always the friendliest or chattiest but they did their job. The shuttle bus to the City, and BeachClub was always on time provided you got there early for a place one bus only took 13 persons. They also appeared to provide complimentary rides to the airport apart from scheduled runs, pick up and return which was good.
All in all, a good hotel provided you know what your looking for, and don't bring Kids!!",3,2009,08,15
30,The rudest staff work at this hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for one night and will never return. Certain members of staff were insulting and rude particularly Miguel and another girl working on reception.
We booked a tjunior suite  room which states on the website that guests can use the tower club room for tapas and drinks from 5 to 11. Firstly, there were no tapas apart from a cold shot glass of soup and a thumbsized mozzerella ball that was hard on the edges. When we asked for tapas, we were told that these were in fact the tapas and they were only served at 5pm. We asked if there was a restaurant near by as we were very hungry at this point, we were told No...We had to wait for one hour for 1 bottle of cava and when we asked for champagne which was given to other guests the previous night, we were rudely asked by a very sulky Miguel if we wanted the cava or not.. Miguel was rude and insulting to our friends on several occasions throughout the night and we are still in shock as to the treatment we received.
Also, at 10pm, the club tower was closed.
On checking out the next day, once again, a rude and unprofessional girl was our point of contact.
We have never came accross staff like this, we have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this hotel is seriously let down by the highly unprofessional staff and because of this we would rate it barely at 3 star.",1,2009,08,13
30,A 3 star experience in a 5 star hotel,"Dear traveler friends, 

I booked a hotel as a package tru the Air France website at a very very reasonable rate.

The hotel is located near the airport in a poor area of Barcelona's outskirts. Not glamorous.

My first impression arriving to the hotel was average as there was no valet or staff at the door and the entrance was poorly lit, one inside I entered a large space that I would define as design-bling-bling.

The architecture of the hotel is about the most interesting thing in this hotel often let down by the choice of cheap furnishings and materials, specially in the lobby.

The staff where harsh and unpeasant, and nobody helped us with our bags or shown us to our rooms.

The rooms where very correct to say the least, nicely decorated, warm and cosy, definetly sound proof and with fllor to ceiling, wall to wall windows, just make sure to be on the side with the city view!!

during our stay we encountered lots of  bizzare situations, such us having to replace our room cards twice per day to gain access to our room.

Many o fthe hotel amenities that make this a 5 star hotel where closed during our stay such as the panoramic restaurant or the hotel massage and beauty spa.

We had read in the hotel's website that there was a suttle service to a nearby beach resort to which we could gain access for an 18 euro fee each day, when we tried to book a day at the resort we where told we had not selected the option from the website and therefore we where not allow use of this service, just bizarre.

do yourself a favor and book elsewhere this hotel is far, far very far fron the city center and even further from the beach, it is a sad ""Ikea style"" imitation of a luxury hotel with poor service and heavy charges.",2,2009,08,11
30,"Superb Hotel, Superb City","Wow, after reading several reviews on here, it was fair to say that I was a little apprehensive before going to the Hesperia Tower with the comments regarding unfriendly staff etc. however I have to say our experience was to the contrary.

I booked the trip as a suprise for my partners birthday and we travelled from the 30th July - 3rd August so had 4 nights.

We arrived late at night so the shuttle wasn't available to us, however no big deal seeing as getting a taxi from the airport is incredibly easy with plenty waiting outside!  The Fare is 20 Euro which isn't too bad and quite frankly, it woldn't have made much sense for the hotel to put the shuttle on just for the two of us!

The hotel is very impressive upon arrival, the design is modern and its very state of the art, definitely what you would expect from a 5 star.  The woman on reception was vry friendly, checked in us quickly and even asked us what floor we wanted to be on and if we wanted a king size bed!  We opted for the 20th floor and the king size bed!  The room was a deluxe so we didn't have access without paying additonally for the pool, fitness, tower club etc. however we found that we didn't even have time to use them seeing as we did so much sightseeing.  A key thing to remember is that you get what you pay for.  Having done a little investigation in advance, we knew exactly what we were getting and quite frankly, didn't want to spend our time in the tower club as its a city where theres so much to see and do during the day and in the evening!  

There was a small bar that did food also in the hotel and we sampled a couple of cocktails, champagne and some Rioja during our stay.  Have to say all were of excellent quality and the bar staff were second to none.  They were friendly, accommodating and more than happy to give advice on the local area or simply just talk about your day!  When they realised it was my other halfs birthday, they brought him out a small slice of chocolate cake with a candle which was a lovely and very personal touch!

The highly rated restaurant EVO and Bouquet bar were closed during our stay.  We think this was down to it being low season in the sense of how busy the hotel was or staff may have been on vacation.  it didn't really bother us seeing as we had planned to eat out every night.

We did order a Veal Burger from the bar and we both agreed that it was possible the best burger that we had ever had - beautifully cooked with perfect garnish.  The other food on the menu also looked fantastic so i'd like to try more if I returned!  its not cheap, however if you pay a bit more then its well worth it!

Several have mentioned the hotel is outside the city centre, however this is very clear when booking the hotel so its not something warranting complaint as it isn't right in the centre.  It is however, very easily and cheaply accessible.  The hotel runs several shuttles into the centre of Barcelona free of charge (just make sure you're there a few mins before to guarantee your place) and the Metro is literally straight opposite and you can buy a 10 trip ticket for just over 7 Euros which is a bargain!  it takes about 15/20 mins to get to the centre and runs till late at night so very easy to use and we had no problems whatsoever.

Back to the hotel, the rooms were beautiful - spotless and modern with nice flat screen tv, two sinks in the bathroom, a very large shower with jets and two shower heads and separate toilet.  The safe was free of charge to use which was handy and the oom was always cool after a long day walking around in the heat.

Overall all, the hotel we thought was very remarkable and the staff we encountered were lovely, friendly and happy to help and would definitely go back again.

I wouldn't recommend it for those wanting big nights out as its a distance to travel late at night and La Ramblas would probably suit better, however for a cool relaxed base in smart surroundings after several busy days, it was perfect!",5,2009,08,10
30,Upper and lower class residents,"If you choose the Deluxe Room (the lowest priced option) you dont get access to the pool area, the tower club, the fitness rooms, and so on.

In fact the staff will constantly ask you ""whats your room number"" and if its below 1600 your pretty much screwed for service and help.

There is a whole community of shops and small eating places nearby, (if you go past the Mediamarkt and to the right). This is great news because the hotels menu suck really bad. Its the same food as the room service offer so stay away from that.

The hotel staff needs a course in English and general behaviour.

Most of the hotels facilities were on a low since its the Spanish holiday season so none of the restaurants were open.

Great breakfast buffet.

Internet access buggy and slow.

The shuttledrivers were really friendly and you can persuade them to set you off at Placa Espana, where theres an Pakistani restaurant nearby with superb food.",3,2009,08,08
30,"Nice hotel, shame about some of the staff and the location","I got a very good deal for this hotel through Travelzoo's top twenty deals, costing ¬£54 per night for an upgrade to a superior double room on the 15th floor including breakfast and beach club access. I had read the reviews on here before departing so I was already prepared to deal with the location issues and the staff! The shuttle was not available to pick us up from the airport so we had to pay 20 euro's for a taxi (even though the meter stated 10.50, the taxi driver pointed to a sign which stated the minimum fare from the airport to anywhere was 20 euros!). We arrived at 11.30 in the morning so was not expecting to be able to check in but Albert on reception was very helpful and friendly and got us checked in quickly. No concierge or porter around. The room was lovely and very nicely decorated but quite small, I expected a little better considering the 'upgrade'. The shuttle bus does run to the timetable stated on the hotel website but if you get it into the centre of Barcelona you're expected to get back via the metro - the metro is easy to use and the nearest station is situated in the hospital car park opposite the front of the hotel. The train carriages themselves are blissfully airconditioned but be prepared to roast whilst walking to the right platform and waiting for the train! It takes about 20 minutes to get back from the city centre. The beach club was quite nice, make sure you get the voucher from reception before going as you need to hand it to one of the staff when you arrive, then they furnish your sunbed with a cushion and give you a towel. There is a outside bar available for drinks, snacks and ice creams and it seemed to be waitress service for the Spanish, but not for English. Like the previous reviewer, we were told the beach club access was only for one day but argued at Reception and eventually won an extra free day - however, having to deal with Elga on Reception nearly caused me a burst blood vessel, I have never had to deal with anyone so rude, petty and petulant in my life! She needs firing, fast! Unlike the previous reviewer, I thought the beach and the sea were gorgeous and didnt come across anything horrible in the sea. In fact I spent a great deal of time in the sea enjoying the big waves that were rolling in. The breakfast buffet was lovely, a great selection of food which was replenished frequently, I was thoroughly spoilt for choice. Apart from the location issue, the other downsides of this hotel were the charges for EVERYTHING and the business feel. However, for the price we got it for it was amazing so I cant really complain. There is a fantastic restaurant perched on top of the hotel in a space age bubble, the chef has 5 Micelin stars......I couldnt wait to treat myself and my partner to dinner and experience the cooking of such a chef......but the restaurant was closed for two weeks for the holidays....!!!

In summary, nice hotel, mostly nice staff (except for evil Elga, watch out for her and avoid if possible), the shuttle does a reasonable job and the rooms are well decorated and comfortable. If you're willing to get to grips with the Metro and dont mind the travelling to get anywhere/everywhere you'll enjoy it. Cant argue if you get it for the price we did.",3,2009,07,30
30,A great short stay business hotel - not an ideal holiday stay,"My boyfriend and i got a great deal here through Travel Zoo's top twenty list. We read a lot of reviews prior to our visit and must say they all rang true compared to our stay.
I sent an e mail to the hotel the weekend before our visit to confirm our booking and have never heard anything back. This sums up the service at the hotel - poor. We were told we would have e free shuttle from the airport but this finished at 8.30pm and our flight landed at 9pm so we had to begrudginly pay 20E for a 10 minute taxi ride to the hotel. Apparently every airport taxi charges 20E minimum! Not a great start to our 5 day stay.
On arrival at the hotel we were not greeted by concierge which was suprising for a five star but pulled our bags up to the desk and up to our rooms without help. As we're in our twenties this wasn't a problem but elderly people may struggle. Check in was very quick and the lobby and our room on the twentieth superior floor were excellent. The architecture and design were stunning as were the views from the fast lifts and our room. This is certainly a fancy, striking hotel to look at.
We were fully aware from other reviews that the location of this hotel was not central and we bought two T10 cards from the handy metro which gave us 10 trips on the metro which was fast to the centre of the city, beaches and sights. After 5 days of getting the metro though we were a bit sick of it and next time would stay more central for a city break of 5 days. Great though for a short stay. The hotel's shuttle bus is fab though, it does trips to the centre of the city, the airport transfer it does however was inconvenient times for us as it does not run all day.
Our deal included 'free access to the beach club' which we expected from this phrase would mean every day, but no, it was only free access for a day. We went one day and it was pleasant and quiet enough but the pool was a little dirty and the sea was foul, two very unpleasant things washed up in front of me whilst i dipped my feet in for 5 minutes! Also, the shuttle only takes 12 at a time so make sure you're there early to avoid disappointment.
The breakfast included was fantastic, a huge selection and very tasty, the mini bar is pricy and goes more expensive at weekends and as mentioned in other reviews they try to rip you off for everthing. The gym was an extra 12E per visit. On our last day we had to be out of our room for 12 but our flight wasn't until 7pm so we went out for the day leaving our bags at the front desk. On return i asked to use the shower facilities which had been promised in the morning. They said no, they have a toilet i could change in but no shower, i was very upset as i felt hot and sticky from the day and needed a wash before i left. They begrudgingly, after talking to three members of staff, gave us a token each for the gym to use the showers there. Very unhelpful staff until you put your foot down and be a little more demanding. 
All in all, the hotel was stunning, cool, luxurious (but no bath in superior room) and very fancy to look at, it's certainly 5 star for appearance. However, beneath the good looks and outer fancy shell, the staff are unfriendly and unhelpful who try to get every last penny out of you. This is definatley a fancy short stay (business) hotel or short city break (great free WIFI) but for a holiday of more than a weekend, no, go more central.",4,2009,07,26
30,"Beautiful hotel, not so nice staff.","Hesperia Tower is not located in the city center but does offer a shuttle 3 times a day there as well as to the airport. The metro station is located nearby and is very easy to use. There are no restaurants or stores other than a Gas Station and electronics store nearby. They take every opportunity to charge you extra for anything. If you want ice, they charge you 5 Euro. Fitness center, 12 Euro. Business center was never open but there was a charge there too. There are no vending machines and room service and restaurants in the hotel are very, very expensive. There is a gas station across the street where you can get a large bag of ice for 1 Euro and snacks for the room. 
It is a very beautiful hotel and our room was comfortable and modern. The only downfall is the staff and the prices for food. If they have the opportunity to charge you extra for something, they will. Our front desk clerk was very obnoxious. I had booked my reservation through Expedia and requested double beds. When my reservation was transferred to the hotel it only listed 1 guest and not my friend. They wanted to charge me 30 Euro per night for my friend. I flat out refused and pointed out the correct reservation on my Expedia print out she told me that it didn't mean anything because for all she knew I could like to sleep on different beds at night. She then took away my free breakfast to make up for the additional guest. I was also expecting a delivery of a package and she didn't even bother to look for it. Of course as soon as I got to my room I had a message that my package was waiting at reception. The only helpful staff member there was the bellman.",4,2009,07,19
30,Definately worth considering,"Hesperia Tower is a luxury 5 star hotel with an ultra-modern feel. The building was designed by Richard Rogers and looks sort of space-age like. The first thing I would say is, yes, it is not near the city centre of Barcelona, but they do provide a free shuttle bus that takes you to the centre of town, 3 times a day. The same shuttle bus also goes to the airport, but rather infrequently so it might not be so convenient.

Breakfast is pretty costly, although they did offer us a discount from 24 euros to 16 euros. Using the swimming pool costs 10 euros per visit.

Some reviews have said that there is nothing in the surrounding area of the hotel, but there is actually a small supermarket (called Caprabo), a fruit and vegetable shop, a cafe, and some other small shops within 5 minutes walking distance. It's on one of the smaller streets so it's not immediately obvious. The underground metro is also 5 minutes away (in the opposite direction to the shops).

They also have a free service that allows you to check in for your flight online using one of there computers in their small business centre. They will keep an eye on you partly to assist you and partly to make sure that you really are using it for online check in and not for checking your emails!

Do take notice of the mini-bar: each drink is on a special tray with sensors underneath. If you remove a drink, it automatically sends a signal to reception that you have removed a drink from the mini-bar, and you will be charged for it. Therefore, you cannot removed their drinks to keep your own drink cool. The same sensors can be found underneath the snack tray. 

So, I would certainly recommend this hotel - there isn't really anything negative to say. For us, it was more or less ideal. But some people might want to return to the hotel in the afternoon either for a nap or to get changed for the evening. It is certainly not very convenient in that sense. A 20 minute car journey from the city centre would make this very time-consuming",5,2009,07,16
30,"Hotel excellent, staff distinctly average","We booked this hotel after getting an excellent deal via travel zoo which offered 50% off the standard rate. We chose to upgrade to a tower club room as this included more amenities.
The hotel is located outside of the main city centre but we didn't find this a problem as the hotel provide a shuttle service to the city centre which runs approx 6 or 7 times a day and also the local metro station is very close to the hotel, this run until approx 12 or 1 in the morning so good for getting back on a night and felt safe. We purchased a 10 journey metro ticket for 7 euros which we thought was excellent value. The journey into town was approximately the same approx 20 mins on the shuttle bus or metro.
As we had paid for a tower club room we expected check in at the tower club lounge, this was not available although check in at main reception was smooth and efficient. Upon checking in to the room, the room was an excellent standard (the largest we have experienced travelling all over the world) with a seperate lounge and bedroom area with two 40inch flat screen tv's. The bathroom was just something else, it was huge, large jacuzzi bath, massive power shower, seperate toilet and large wash basin area with double sinks. The bathroom amenities were all Bvlgari and there was everything we needed, slippers, choice of robes, shoes cleaning kit, comb, brush etc etc. On our confirmation it said we would receive flowers and fruit on arrival, this was not the case and when we asked reception about this they kindly provided us with Champagne and strawberries and chocolate. On our second day in the hotel we had been out all day into Barcelona and came back to find our room door has been left open by the maid which we were not very happy about at all and although all of our valuables were in the safe this was not the point, we immediately complained to reception about this and they said they were sorry and if we needed anyone to come up to the room they would send someone. So we paid a bit extra for the tower club room which was definately worth it as we had access to the tower club lounge which provided free drinks and snacks all day as well as free internet access. The lounge was spacious was comfortable settees and tv and bang and olufsen cd player as well as a range of books and newspapers. At the time we were there it was very quiet so we basically had the run of the place to ourselves. We definately got our monies worth on the free bar. We had slight problems when things needed replenishing as there was no member of staff on the tower club reception which seemed an issue because this meant anyone could use the lounge.The tower club room also got access to the spa facilities although we did not have time to use this. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was served on the fourth floor and there was lots of choice of hot and cold food, pastries and bread, fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, cereals. During the week breakfast finished at 10.30am and a couple of mornings when we went down at 10am there was little choice and when we asked if they had any more produce they didn't so it was worth getting down earlier for breakfast. Again this was definately worth getting it included in the room rate. Staff seemed friendly and pleasant although didn't go out of their way to help you which isn't what you would expect from a five star hotel. 
Overall a room this size and hotel of this quality set in central Barcelona would cost in excess of 200 euros per night so the value is unquestionable however the quality of service and general finishing touches with which you would associate with a five star hotel were sometimes missing in this case. The hotel has the ability to be sensational but only succeeds as average.",4,2009,07,16
30,clean and modern--but a little far out,"We stayed in the Hesperia Tower 5 for a weekend trip to Barcelona because of the great deal we got from their website.  The hotel is primarily a business hotel and so it seemed they were offering summer deals to travelers to try to fill their rooms.  The hotel is very modern and well-designed and even has a 5 star Michelin restaurant at the top of it (in the spaceship-looking part).  

Our room was big and comfortable, and the bathroom was absolutely huge and incredible.  We were on the 20th floor and had a STUNNING view of all of Barcelona, from the Barca FB stadium to the Sagrada Familia to Montjuic--seriously amazing!  Our room was very clean and smelled fine, but our friends just 2 doors away had a room that smelled pretty strongly of cigarette smoke--even when they has specifically asked for a non-smoking room.

The rate we received included a breakfast at the restaurant on their 4th floor, which was very good, and varied.  Definitely worth eating that breakfast to ready yourself for a day in Barcelona.  On the flip side of that,  if there had been no included breakfast there was no way were were willing to spend 24 euros on the continental breakfast (per person)--and there were no restaurants or shops nearby that we noticed to grab anything.  At one point we walked 10 minutes to a gas station to grab a snack while waiting for a friend to arrive from London...

We also had a rental car, which we were able to park for free on the street close the hotel--a real plus for us!

The negative aspect of the hotel was the distance from the center city of Barcelona.  This hotel is really for business travelers that are using its attached convention center, or needing the hospital nearby rather than city tourists.  The Metro was just across the street, however, with a direct line to Placa Catalunya, which is right at the top of the Ramblas.  It did take up about 20-25 on the train, depending on the time of day, to get to Catalunya.  Also, during the day hours there are taxis lined up outside the hotel to take you where you need to go, but at night they need to call a taxi  for you.  This can be considerably more expensive since in Spain the taxi can start running its meter from when it is called, and not just when it picks you up.  This turned a normal 12-14 euro taxi ride into about 20-23 euros to the El Born district for us, which was a bummer.",4,2009,07,13
30,"5* bliss, great service, an enjoyable and romantic stay","I think the title says it all.. 

My boyfriend and I went on our first holiday together.. we opted for a vibrant city where there was lots to do.. & chose a hotel which oozed, class, comfort and good service. We were not disappointed. 

We arrived late night, the service was still offered with a smile and the staff were very welcoming.. 

The room was absolute heaven... We requested a room on a high floor, so that we had a good view.. it wasn't the best view but when the sun was shining we had a great view of Mount Tipidabo (please note if you're to go there, take a warm jumper and be prepared to be ripped off.. not as great as some have said, but has amazing views)...

The room was warm, welcoming, relaxing and very comfortable.. However, I was a lil bemused and surprised, that its the bathroom that you will first see as you enter the room.. slightly odd.. but understandable going on the way it is set up. 
You will fall in love with the Bathroom.. WOW!!!! Black marble, amazing shower, complimentary gowns and slippers.. nice little touches. 

The service was second to none, however, I do think we were the only ones staying there at the time, so I think they were grateful to be called.. It was very quiet, time of year maybe? 

We stayed for 4 nights and after the busy days that we spent out and about exploring the city, we were thankful to return to a room where we could just chill to the point where we didn't go out on some nights, as we slept like babies on our return.. 

As we all know nothing in life is perfect, my only criticisms of the hotel are the shocking prices of the food.. but then again if your staying in a 5* you expect silly prices.. but for the food they were serving, it was not worth it.. so try eating out... 

The shuttle service was not very regular.. We only used it once to the city & to the airport. They do offer a shuttle service to the hotel on your arrival from the airport. Contact the hotel for details and times, however, they stop running at 8.30pm, so it was our luck we had to take a taxi and let him rip us off for about 20Euros for a 10min drive. So plan your days and evenings out according to their schedule or use the metro which is a 5 min walk away.. I would recommend you purchase the 10 journey ticket.. for about 7Euros that does as it says on the bottle. Literally travel around 10 times.. on the metro.. We found it easy, fun and gained so much more, instead of travelling on a tour bus!!!! 

Be warned, Barcelona is ridiculously expensive.. but for a short break, the hotel, city and folk really made it a holiday and our first romantic getaway very very special and memorable. I would definitely stay at Hesperia again...",5,2009,07,08
30,"Nice hotel, but far away from city centre and expensive extra's""","I stayed 5 nights at this hotel in June 2009 after getting a flight and hotel deal on ""lastminute.com.""  This hotel was definetly newer and a 5 star.  However, the location isnt in the city center so its about $12 euro by cab or $2.50 euros by metro (15 minutes and the metro station is right outside).  Some other draw backs were that the hotel incidential / extras were very pricey.  The intenet costs $5 euros for 15 minutes of use.  The pool is indoors and is not included in the hotel stay, it is $12 euros per day of use.  It is $5.50 euros for a can of coke from the restaurant. It is $20 euros for breakfast and $20 euros for a hamburger.  Another tip about this hotel would be to arrange the shuttle from the airport to pick you up, otherwise you may be waiting as it doesn't have a set schedule.  The front desk staff was very helpful in finding things to do.  There are no restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.  I would stay here again but only if there wasn't a decent hotel in the city centre available.",3,2009,07,06
30,Fantastic hotel - although a bit of a distance from the centre...,"We arrived after getting ripped off by one of the airport taxi's. The driver insisted that there was a 20 Euro charge on top of the 13 Euro meter charge for airport service. The trip took no more than 10 minutes which we thought was a rip off. Checking into the hotel at 10:00am we did not expect the room to be ready but it was and the receptionist reduced the price of the breakfast for us to 15 Euro each per day which was very good of her. The room 1412 was very comfortable with a good view over the city. The bathroom was very plush and value for money wise we were well satisfied. We ate out in the city apart from breakfast each day during our 3 night stay but I can tell you that breakfast was very good and the waiting staff were very attentive and helpful. The only downside to this hotel was the location away from the city. We travelled in / out on the metro each day (stop 300 meters from hotel) which was clean and airconditioned and took around 25 minutes each way. Other than that, we could not fault this hotel.",5,2009,07,04
30,...and the best choice for hotel stay iissss NOT this one!,"First let me explain how I came to choose this hotel to begin with. Prior to my arrival I had researched on tripadvisor several different locations. I finally made my choice which was not this hotel. I arrived 3 days prior to my departure for a cruise and was to remain for an additional 5 days after my return. I decided prior to my arrival that I would chose a different hotel for the second part of my stay in order to properly experience Barcelona.

When I left the cruise I still had not made a reservation at any hotel so in my haste I returned to my first hotel only to find that they did NOT have availability at the end of my stay. I asked the concierge for a recommendation figuring I should stay somewhere closer to the airport, and she recommended this hotel. I had read the reviews, seen the website, and was completely sold!

I decided to treat myself and stay in a suite. With all of the amenities, the service the website boasted, and the visual excitement the pictures showed I knew this was the best choice and I had made the right decision!

Upon my arrival, the bell guys showed attentiveness, and I immediately felt embraced. Once I began to check in I felt a little uneasy. I figured it was me and blew it off. The girl (Laura) at the desk checked me in, upsold me, handed me my key and shoed me off. I was famished and was left to asking the bellman where there was to eat. He recommended the resturaunt on the 3rd floor and I tipped him appreciatedly and departed.

The resturaunt was busy as it was lunch time (3:00pm). After a few minutes I was seated. After a few minutes more I was brought a menu. After a few minutes more my order was taken. Now if you see where I'm going with this...eventually I got up and left. On my way out the girl at the door explained that they were busy and she could write down my order. I told her there was no need and proceeded to the bar. I only knew that was an option because I had read an earlier review where a couple was told their kids would not like the food and they were sent to the bar.

The bar food was fine. Quick, and well done. I decided to go to the spa..figuring maybe I was a little stressed. (You have to go to the front desk to receive a token if entry to the spa is included with your room.) I proceeded to the front desk and was given directions on how to get to the Metropolitain Club/Spa which is attached to the hotel. Now in my haste I forgot to mention that I had stopped by the front desk prior to going up to my room, which is how I knew to stop by and receive a token. I had also been told at that time that I would have to walk outside and down the sidewalk to get to the spa. I thought that was crazy for the mere fact that I wasn't used to going through all of that trouble in a five star hotel.

The Metropolitain Spa/Club was nice. I could not read a lot of the signs as my spanish is not great and there were no english translations so I guess you can say that's my fault. Not as many people here speak english as I had read prior to my arrival, but that may have been that they just didn't speak it to me, which I will write about in a different review.

That evening I found out about a lot of things that were not explained to me concerning my room. I found these things out by visiting the website. Like my fresh fruit and flowers, that by the way I am still waiting for.... I requested a pink room prior to my arrival, and my room was made pink after I mentioned it to the front desk.

I requested non-smoking and walked into a room with an ashtray and a cigarette burn on the couch. The bathroom was very clean and the amenities in there were very nice, although I did not arrive to a fully stocked room. The robe I received for the ""pink room"" had a faint smell to it...not musty, but as if someone had used it that was wearing perfume, and it had not been washed afterwards.

Everytime I went to the club tower, which was always stocked very lovely with sweets, drinks, and alcohol, there was never a concierge present, and the occasions that there was, I was questioned as to my room number. Now I do understand that the floor is only for certain guests, but you would think that by my 4th night(which was my last), they would not ask again!!!!

I did make mention of my unhappiness on the second night of my stay. There was no Manager available and the man at the desk (tall, skinny, dark hair), began to go out of his way to make my stay better. The girl (Laura) who had originally checked me in began to give me the cold shoulder. On the third night of my stay I was able to speak with the manager who sent champagne, water, chocolate and strawberries up to my room. Then he said he would speak with his general manager and get back with me on my last day, which at this point has not happened. 

It is actually my last night. I stayed in, and when housekeeping called I told them I would leave in an hour so they could clean my room. I returned two hours later to a still dirty room. I tried to look on the bright side and be understanding, but I can't help but note that my exceedingly high expectations of a five star hotel had to be lowered. 

What I expected from this hotel I did not receive. I felt the service was as if I were staying in a regular room in a 3 star. Maybe my expectations are too high, but what does that say of this property? I can only say, the hotel is beautiful, with great new technology. The gym, and jacuzzi are wonderful, and the Club Tower lounge food and beverage selection is remarkable. If that's all you need for your hotel stay then I recommend you stay here. Unfortunately the location is a bit distant, with employees who are incapable of giving solid directions. The language barrier (to include the lack of a presence of at least one english speaking channel that is NOT the news!!! i.e. FOX, which the other hotel did have) is difficult. And the overall service is just not to standard. I am still a little upset with the curtness of Laura at the front desk.

I have to mention the Flamenco show she scheduled me for was awesome! The only problem is that when I asked to move up the time, or see if dinner could be added she said it was impossible without even calling. I asked her to call and she said she already knew. Unfortunate for her, when I arrive 45 minutes early for my show and 30 minutes late for dinner, they were able to seat me for dinner....makes me wonder...especially since I was given the same run around for a massgae and manicure the following day, which I had told them two days prior I would want to have done.

Bottom line, I guess in this case you don't get what you pay for!",2,2009,06,26
30,"Nice room, but don't ask for anything$$$$$","The rooms are nice but bad location to start, 12 Euro each to use pool/gym, nice large ice bucket that they will fill for a 5 euro charge, no ice machine, breakfast no problem, 24 euro each. ie. better off going to a 4 star instead of 5 with a better location and free services. Also offered me a upgrade for 50 euro to a ""junior suite"" when the sign clealry said 40 euro, i would not recomend this hotel.",1,2009,06,05
30,Really nice but,"This hotel is nice-really nice in an odd way.  Doors in the hall are all highly polished dark wood and match the surronding wood perfectly but--Halls are very very dark.  Bathroom is as nice as I have ever had in a hotel but--dark marble and very auster feeling.  Elevator system is good but--certainly different from any I have experience before.  No buttons, you slide your room key a card reader and from a computer screen, select t he floor you want to go to.  It tells you which elevator to go to.  Was fast but--you can't change your mind if you forget something, you have to ride to your destination, then slide your card again to go back to your room to get your camera.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the subway but--it's a 20 minute subway ride to Las Ramlas.  From the outside this hotel looks like the hotel of the future but--it's not the future and its kind of odd looking.  But--the staff is friendly, the rooms are very nice, the beds are really comfortable, the shower (no bath tub in our room, fine with me, wife unhappy) is great.  There are no nearby restaurants that we found but you are just a fairly close taxi ride to the airport.  Overall experience was pleasant but a little cold.",4,2009,06,03
30,Great value - do your research and you will know what to expect!,"The hotel accommodations are beautiful. The lobby, rooms and bathrooms are spectacular and clean. The service from the staff was excellent the moment we arrived (we got to the hotel around 10 a.m. and were immediately able to get into our room; this would never happen in the States!). The location is very convenient to the metro (Hospital de Bellvitge stop on the L1 ‚Äì red line). This is the last stop on the line and it‚Äôs about a five minute walk to the station. Depending on where you are heading you can expect a 20-40 minute ride. The hotel has a shuttle service that runs at least three times daily into Pla√ßa Catalunya (check the hotel web site for the schedule). You are also able to get the shuttle back to the hotel from the same location it drops you off. When you arrive at the Barcelona airport go to the information booth and they will call the hotel and have the shuttle come get you. On two occasions we took a taxi from downtown to the hotel because we were out later than the metro was running. Both times we paid less than 15‚Ç¨ to get to the hotel from the Born neighborhood. 

I have only a few suggestions for hotel improvements. They seem to be lacking in some standard services (that I am used to in cheap US hotels). I expected to have an iron, ironing board, and hair conditioner. I would recommend you bring your own conditioner because I wasn‚Äôt able to find any small bottle at the grocery store. Also, the wireless internet signal is extremely poor in the rooms. The only place we were able to get a good wifi signal was in the lobby on the chairs near the elevator bay. Most of the nights we spent downtown, however a couple times we attempted to go to the bar on the third floor, it was practically empty (even on the weekends) and while it looks very trendy you can have a better atmosphere for less money in the city.",4,2009,05,29
30,Wow!!!,"We stayed here for 2 nights and were taken by extreme suprise at the very high standard and quality of the hotel! The staff and overall cleanliness of the hotel were good. although the hotel is out of the centre of Barcelona, it is very near to the tube station- which is handy! The only bad thing I would say about the hotel is the astronomically priced meals in the hotel's EVO restaurant - 135euros EACH!!",5,2009,05,26
30,"Well worth the stay, do your homework first though","Just got back from 3 nights Hesperia Sat,Sun and Monday.

The hotel is about 5 mile outside the main centre, but you can travel about on a relatively low budget. Yes the taxis do charge a fortune from the centre our was about ¬£20 from the interchange.

However there is a metro underground stop (5 mins from front door), literally across the road situated in hospital car park. The Metro line is the Red Line and is the last stop on the line (about 9 stops from goth quarter). cost ¬£7.00 for 10 trips = 70p. Takes about 25 minutes. I would class it as safe but watch your pockets especially at busy times, fortunatley i caught the one who tried to get mine !, its hard enough at the best of times getting brass out out of a Yorkshireman !. That aside i would use it again tomorrow.

The hotel does run a free shuttle bus to the centre at 10am and then again in the evening, which is also handy, check with reception for times, discount vouchers and maps before venturing into the centre.

People have put on here that there are no shops around and that the hotel is in the middle of nowhere, we had a fab meal at a typically spanish restaurant not 10 mins walk away, there is a nice town 2 stops away at La Hospitalet, discovered after we got off the metro at the wrong stop, took 20 mins to walk back to hotel from there.

As for the hotel staff excellent, we upgraded to the tower club which is a little expensive but well worth it if you want to add a bit more to your stay. Basically it gives you a free bar and tapas for your stay along with swimming and gym etc..

A member of staff  called Roger looked after us and he was brill, as really were the rest of the staff but reckon he derserves special praise.

Breakfast are very good, however for some reason they reduce the amount of cooked options from week days to weekends, you get more at the weekend.

Def 5* and highly recommended.",5,2009,05,19
30,The best in Barcelona!,"I stayed 7 days at the Tower Hotel. We loved every minute of our vacation. The Staff went out of their way to help us. The hotel was beautiful. The metro was one block away for easy access to ""La Rambla"" the center of the city which was approximately 20 min away. On the fourth day I rented a car (front desk) which cost me $249.00 euros includes all fees and insurance w/unlimited mileage. The hotel has parking but it's 24 euros per day. However, there is plenty of free parking on the side of the hotel. There is a restaurant one block away where we had breakfast for 14 euros for two. The breakfast was two eggs (ala plancha) and five sausages with coffee, tea and bread. Loosing too much money from dollars to euros I needed to preserve not spend. Like any other five star hotel in the world it is always pricy. Nonotheless, If you don't want to be in the center of the city and need a little bit of privacy, this is the place to be..................",5,2009,05,13
30,Shame about the area,"If you are looking to sight-see Barcelona..think about booking a good 3/4 star hotel in the centre, possibly just off the Ramblas which is the main area in Barcelona centre.  We thought we could get away with booking the best hotel and not be bothered by the distance between the hotel and the centre...At the end of a busy sight seeing day it would have been wonderful to have been able to pop back to our hotel for a rest and change of clothing......this was virtually impossible with the Hisperia Tower.... Do not believe that this hotel is only a short distance away....or that the Hotel has a shuttle bus...(This bus was never available during the hours 10am to 7pm.)We used the metro which was a good walk away but always punctual and clean.  This would then take us to the centre in about 20/25 mins. but add to this waiting time and access to metro and the whole return trip is about 90 mins... far too much to be bothered to come back into the centre when you are really tired.... A taxi would cost 25euros and take at least 25/30mins  as we stayed for 5 nights this could have cost ¬£250 euros for 5 return journeys.  We would stay out all day and eat in the centre...then returned to the Hotel for a night-cap..this in itself was an experience.... Non-one seemed to want to stay for a drink because the surroundings are so clinical and not at all relaxing...  Why was this hotel built on a Motorway surrounded by a Hospital..Hospital car park...garage.. and tower blocks..There is absolutely NOTHING near this hotel that would interest a traveller ...not even a shop!!   We would only recommend this Hotel as a Conference Centre near the Airport.  On the positive side...the breakfasts were the best we have ever eaten !!!!",3,2009,05,05
30,Wonderful Hotel!!,"My husband and I spent 1 night at the Hotel before our cruise, which we selected based upon Tripadvisor recommendations, and we were not disappointed.  Very friendly staff, and nothing is too much trouble. Good  service, great catalan breakfasts. 10 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from La Rambles and the port. We had a wonderful suite and have nothing but wonderful memories.  Nothing negative to report.  Look forward to returning and staying longer.",5,2009,04,09
30,WE`LL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My friends and I visited Barcelona for my 40th birthday and I wont forget the experience.  The hotel is amazing, we had a brilliant deal through Travelzoo.  None of us have any complaints and there were 6 of us.  5 Star hotel with 100% star staff.",5,2009,04,03
30,Stylish & modern luxury! Shame about the food...,"my boyfriend treated me to weekend in Barcelona, so when we pulled up to the Hotel in our over-priced taxi (20euros for a 10 min drive!) - I was AMAZED! The reception is a grand contemporary space with friendly, smiling staff. It's size is a little overwhelming and can make one feel a little out of place - but I just stuck on my over-sized glasses and put on my wannabe celebrity walk as i sauntered across to the desk.
The room matched the chic, modern style of the hotel - lots of sleek black marble, mirrors and chrome. Again - spacious! The bedroom part is a luxury design with a HUGE comfy bed and all the fancy technologies of a 5* hotel. Open the curtains and WOW! Floor to ceiling window giving you a lovely night view of the motorways - with the backdrop of Catalan hills, which is gorgeous to wake up to. You're not there to stare out the window all day now,  are you!
Pay 12euros and get access to the gym and luxury spa - it's worth it!
Unfortunately - the food doesn't match the standard of the style of the hotel. As it's about 15/20 minutes from the city, we decided to treat ourselves and eat at the award-winning restaurant at the top of the tower - EVO. The service and view were excellent, but the food was NOT worth the 135euro price tag. I'd be happier spending that at a good restaurant in London and enjoy the food - but it really wasn't enjoyable here unfortunately. The next night, we ordered room service for a quick bite before heading back into town. Their idea of a veg and prawn stir fry - was just soaked in Soy sauce! Totally inedible! I was gasping for water after the first bite - so we sent it back, got ready and grabbed a lovely paella on the port front. That same morning, we have to pay 20euros for the breakfast buffet. Again NOT worth it. The scrambled eggs were powdered! Gross! Not impressed at all - a total rip of for 20euros, when you think for ¬£20 in London would by you 2 decent full english breakfasts!
My recommendation - gorgeous place to stay, but the food really lets it down.Especially, when you're so far out of town and you don't have any choice.",4,2009,03,27
30,Not great location,"Stayed here for 1 night for a business trip as my regular hotels were fully booked. The facilities, including bedroom, are above average, but wouldnt categorise them as luxurious. Two points of note:

(i) hotel is very isolated and overlooks the main dual carriageway from the airport to the city. Its a ‚Ç¨10 taxi ride into town.   

(ii) dining facilities are not cheap. I paid ‚Ç¨65 for a meal without drinks

Overall, ok for a quick business trip, but certainly not for a romantic weekend away.",3,2009,02,08
30,Loved it!,"This was our first trip to Barcelona.  We booked through Priceline so did not know what to expect.  When we arrived in the hotel, we were very excited at the choice of hotel.  It was beautiful - very classy but chic.  It was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in.  The elevators were actually a nice feature of the hotel.  You just tap where you want to go and voila, it tells you which elevator you will take.  The pictures posted are basically the same that i took so you will get what you see...

ROOM:  The rooms were fantastic!  Great design and very spacious.  The bathroom is black granite with 2 sinks; separate toilet from the shower and large spacious closet.   They provide slippers and a robe for you to use while you are there.  Then a door that separates your bathroom from the bedroom - very nice!  Large bed, very very comfortable and chair, desk, large flat screen TV or plasma (not sure).  Then a 2 person sofa in the room.   Be sure to order from the pillow menu...yes try out some different pillows!

SERVICE:  The service was good.  Easy check-in and check-out.  We called to front desk two times for something and they were up to our room within minutes.  The hotel was not fully booked so that may have had some bearing on the promptness.  The only complaint was the room stayed pretty cool even after we asked to have it fixed.  

We were all pleased with our stay and hope we can stay here again on another visit back to Spain.",5,2009,01,26
30,Style over substance,"We stayed in the Hesperia Tower for 3 nights. Not my idea of 5 star luxury. No bath, just a shower. We were promised a city view, but got a motorway view. But worst of all, on our last night we requested an early wake up call for the following morning as we had to catch our plane home, and they failed to do the call. When we came down and complained to the duty manager, he and his reception staff did not seem at all bothered by this critical failure of service. And forget about the spectacular views from the glass dome at the top. Guests are forbidden to enter unless they eat there. So, if you like lots of  snazzy mirrors and black granite over good service then this is for you.",2,2008,12,27
30,absolutely loved this hotel had an amazing time,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel, and WOW is the opinion!! We updated to the tower club and was so well worth the 60euros per night!! We drunk the best champagne (yes champagne not cava) every night included in the price and when we finished one bottle they opened another. The express breakfast was lovely, a choice of cereals, fruit juices, cold meats, croissants and pastries. You could call in anytime in the day for drinks, coffee and snacks. Also included in the upgrade was membership to the Metro club next door which was a fabulous spa (small tip if you care going you need flip flops and a bathing hat for the pool). The staff at the hotel could not do enough for you and found them to be most helpful and tried very hard to get their english correct. The room was fabulous with a gorgeous view of the city, and the shower was out of this world.
Although a few kilometres from town centre it is on the metro line and we got a 3 day ticket at very reasonable cost that enabled us to use the metro and buses to go anywhere in the city. Book this hotel you will not regret it!!!!",5,2008,12,13
30,LOVED the Hesperia Tower!!!!,"I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Hesperia Tower and thoroughly enjoyed the stay! I cannot recommend this hotel enough, and we will certainly be visiting again!! 
Upon checking in, the receptionist noticed it was my boyfriends birthday the previous day. Just as we settled into the room there was a knock on the door and we received a lovely letter from the hotel manager congratulating my boyfriend on his birthday together with a bottle of champagne, strawberries and chocolate. A lovely gesture we thought. 
The bedroom is a good size for a modern hotel. Although the hotel is near a main road there was no noice what so ever. The bed was very comfortable as was the sofa. The floor to ceiling window allowed great views of the city and the automatic curtains was another unusual touch. Obviously the plug sockets are European, and fitted all our appliances perfectly well, no issue there. There are various sets of lights to accomodate for bed time reading, The heating system was easy to use, with a fan, cool and heat system, which you could set to high, medium or low. We found ourselves using the fan a lot of the time, even though it was November!
The bathroom really does make the room though, the shower was fantastic, we couldnt get enough of the power jets. Very luxurious. A wide range of toilitries were topped up every day including shampoo, body lotion, shower gel, soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, shower cap, shaving set, shoe shine.
The bathroom is more suited to couples however, as there are mirrors everywhere and you can see into the bathroom from the bedroom if you sit at the wrong angle! There are two door in the bathroom, one for the shower, the other for the toilet. The photographs really dont do the bathroom enough justice! 
Unfortunately we had to move rooms as the glass on our shower shattered when we were out, but this was not a big issue. The staff were apologetic but it was a matter of health and safety anyway.
We booked this hotel on lastminute.com as a secret hotel. However, it is extremely easy to work out which hotel it is seeing as there arnt too many 5* hotels in Barcelona with 40 odd reviews! At ¬£200 for 3 nights for two people it was a bargain!!!",5,2008,11,16
30,Great looking hotel but lacking,"We stayed here for two nights and paid the extra for the club room. The hotel looks great and the rooms look very welcoming. The club check-in was very relaxing with us being sat down and enjoying a coffee while the rooms were sorted out.

Our initial thoughts on the rooms were wow. Large, clean and packed with extras as you would normally find in most 5* hotels.

The room has a large foyer area that leads to an open plan bathroom vanity area with a large walk in shower and seperate closet for the wc. The bedroom leads on from the bathroom where there is a comfy kings size bed and sofa. The literature states that the rooms have extras such as Bang and Olsfen sounds system but this is not correct. However there is a large plasma screen tv (but the dvd played that they advertise is not in the room). There is a multifunctional alarm/cd/radio/mp3 however our time was wrong on the clock and there was no instructions on how to change the time or set an alarm. 
The electric sockets do not fit most UK adaptors which also proved a problem.

The rooms have free wifi but our room was obviosuly too far away to receive it which seemed really strange. The evening proved to be very disappointing in the club lounge. They offer tapa in the evening designed by the renowned chef Santi Santamaria. They were very disappointing and consisted of a glass of cold mushroom soup, a bite size wonton and a cheese stick (see picture). We asked for somemore as they had run out and waited 45 minutes for the same things to come out which seemed a little excessive.
The restaurant offered a very limited menu and the award winning restaurant was fully booked. The room service menu was ok but didn't seem value for money.
The bed was very comfortable with a selection of pillows available. The shower offered three types of jet but took ten minutes for us to figure out how to operate despite the instructions as some of the fixtures wouldn't move as the diagrams said they would.

I think that the hotel is very good on most things but the small things proved too much inconvenience for what is a 5* and would not stay here again.",2,2008,11,02
30,"Nice hotel, but way out of town","Stayed here for a long weekend in September. Mainly chose this hotel because I got it from Expedia for a great price for a five star hotel.

The hotel its self is way out of town, but there is a metro station two minutes away (It is the first stop on the red line, the station is through the large car park across from the main entrance of the hotel). It took 25 minutes to get to the middle of town.

The Hotel was very modern and cool. It has a very highly rated and expensive resteraunt called Evo on the pod on top of the building but this was closed during our stay. Given its location it is mainly a business hotel. It was quite close to the airport - cost about 12 Euro. The hotel also runs a shuttle bus to the airport 2 or 3 times a day at specific times - so it is useful if your flight times tie in with the bus schedule - we used it for a late evening flight - it left the hotel at 3pm,

All the staff were very good and frendily with the exception of a young woman who was at reception in the evenings who was quite unhelpful.

The rooms nice, you come in the main door into the very nice bathroom then there is a further glass door into the bedroom. The bathroom had the best shower ever - very powerful and lots of different jets.",4,2008,10,17
30,Hotel with Wow Factor!,"Best features:  Efficient & pleasant concierge and hotel services, efficient Reception staff.  The rooms are worthy of a modern 5*. The beds are so comfy - real quality.  The view from the 18th floor is stunning (not so great when on the ground).  The lift system is the best yet!  There is a Shuttle bus service to main tourist area.   Jordi Vincente - the restaurant and Bar Manager was very helpful - thank you. 

Worst Features:  No shuttle bus service from the main tourist area.  Little bit out of the way when on a short visit to Barcelona.  It takes a couple of days to realize that the metro is so near and so easy.  The breakfast, although good quality food and of reasonable variety - there were no bowls for cereal, no plates for hot food, no side plates and this was when there were only 6 people in the restaurant.  I complained to the management and the next day the manager and all the waiting staff were on their toes - determined to please.  However, at 22 euros per person it was not my favourite part of the day.  Worth noting the swimming pool is not included and a fee of around 12 euros per person per visit is charged.

To sum up:  I got a great deal on the stay and it was generally a lovely hotel so yes, I would stay again and if the breakfast service had been better I would have given it a 5.",2,2008,10,02
30,Great hotel fantastic service,Just back from a romantic weekend in Barcelona stayed at the Hesperia tower. We upgraded to the tower club. Fantastic great value for money. Beautiful room with fantastic views. Not pretty as it is in a built up residential area lots of tower blocks but dramatic. Service impeccable. I told the reservations when upgrading it was my husbands birthday they left us a lovely welcome letter with birthday greetings. Roses on the bed at night chilled cava with strawbwrries and chocolate sauce!!!!! could you ask for more The sixty pound up grade included  a lovely buffet breakfast in  a fantastic lounge tapas and champagne  or whatever you wanted to drink at seven untill eleven. So you could pop in for a nignt cap on return .The excellent metro is accross the road so ultra convieient. This is a great hotel.I left my coat behind and they are posting it as we speak no problem. The modern decor is amazing.  Enjoy.,5,2008,10,01
30,Wonderful Staff and an amazing hotel,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and cannot emphasise how amazing it is.  Yes it is a little way from the city but the courtesy bus is so frequent and on time.  We took our nephew with us who lives in Canada and we booked a suite with access to the Tower Club.  WE arrived in Barcelona with no luggage - thanks to BMI BABY.  The hotel arranged extra toiletries as ours had been lost with the luggage - they then led us to the lounge where a large glass of champagne was poured.  They were so sympathetic to our situation even though in this beautiful hotel we only had the clothes in which we stood.  Having stayed in many fine hotels around the world this one ranks up there as one of the best.  The whole ambience you cannot appreciate until you are there.  We were on the 19th floor and my nephew was able to spot all the major landmarks from his window.  Breakfast was made to order  and the Tapas range in the evenings spectacular.  Although my Canadian nephew had not had Tapas before - they brought him plate after plate - and were so sweet.  
The hotel is a joy, the staff are some of the nicest I have ever experienced throughut my travels.  Please do not hesitate to book this hotel - you will not be sorry",4,2008,07,21
30,Excellent Hotel,"Ok so it is out of the city but that was quite nice.  Yes it is a business hotel but it has great rooms, fantastic restaurants and the staff were very attentive.The metro stop is just outside and the journey is 15 mins  and taxis were only 7 euros.I do agree it is in a very strange neighbourhood.There is a supermarket nearby  Visit the restaurants at  Port Olympic.  You have to do the bus tours but it does take two days.  Visit the spanish village on the blue route it is worth it for the restaurants.",5,2008,07,18
30,Design over function,"As other reviewers have stated, this is more of a business than a holiday hotel. 10 minutes from airport. Not a place you would want to stroll around outside, as surrounding area is not very nice. For a holiday I would not recommend it, most definitely. For business, or a conference, yes. Design seems to take precedence over functionality. For example the lobby bar seats look great, but try sitting in some of them....The washrooms on the ground floor look great, but no-one had taken into account that women might want to put their handbag or make up bag down somewhere. And the lifts were in a class of their own, they drove me crazy for the whole time. You cannot just get in a lift, you must state on an LCD which floor you want to get out at and you get assigned a lift. OK, but when there is a queue of people it can get chaotic. And sometimes it gets more complicated as you also have to swipe your room card and then choose the floor. As the lifts were packed one day and I wanted to get to the 4th floor I tried the stairs. Only to find that they only go as far as the 2nd floor and had to get the lift...
The rooms were very nicely designed, slightly different than the bog standard business hotel. No kettle or iron. 
And the 3rd floor bar is beautifully designed and quite comfy.
Bar prices quite steep, but a tip is to order a bottle of wine at the bar, approx ‚Ç¨22 which is reasonable.
Food good, no complaints there.
Don't get me wrong, despite my criticisms above, it is a very nice hotel to stay at, but I would not choose it as a tourist to Barcelona.",3,2008,05,24
30,Not a vacation hotel,This is a conference/business hotel about 25 minutes metro ride from Barcelona city centre. It is not a holiday hotel. The area is not pleasant with hardly any shops or restaurants. The hotel looks completely out of place in a relatively run down area. Everything about the hotel is modern and cutting edge state of the art. Whilst everything about our room was comfortable the overall hotel experience was sharp rather than holiday relaxing. Breakfast was OK but our scrambled eggs on the first day were horrible and we could not eat them and did not try eggs again. The one dinner we had was 5 star expensive and lousy. On one day there was no hot water at shower time in the morning. This  in a virtually empty 5 star hotel. A small bus shuttles between the airport and into town. However on the Saturday that we left there were very few shuttle buses and we had to resort to taking a taxi. The shuttle bus goes into the city but does not return. So unless you take a taxi it can be a little unnerving using the metro late at night. Taxi - 2 staff involved - one to wheel our small cases and the second to put them into the taxi and of course both were tipped for little or  no effort or work. However all the staff who served us were very helpful and polite. We chose this hotel because it had a special offer - 5 star hotel for 4 star money and even then it was nearly empty. For a holiday in Barcelona I would not recommend this hotel. Barcelona itself is well worth a long weekend with stunning architecture.,3,2008,04,08
30,stunning modern architecture,"We loved this building.  Go to Madrid to see outstanding building design in Terminal 4 of the airport.  Go to Barcelons to experience the pure pleasure of state of the art design, luxury quality materials and exciting spaces in Hesperia Tower.  This is a must for anyone who loves architecture and enjoys new thinking on making buildings.  We went Barcelona to see Gaudi buildings  - quirky, packed with visitors even in raining weekday January.  Opposite end of the design continuum is the Rogers and co Hesperia Tower, with some echoes of the Modernist Mies van der Rohe Pavilion in the Exposition Park.

Hesperia Tower is a tube ride from central Barcelona, but the panoramic views, the sheer enjoyment of the black marble, stainless steel and 'inside out' design reminiscent of the Pompidou Centre is so worth the out of town location.  We're going to Barcelona again, to see it in sunshine and to stay in this hotel  again,  Best breakfast I have ever had and the most delicious evening meals we had in Spain!",5,2008,01,24
30,"Beautiful hotel, let down by a few niggles","We stayed in the Hesperia Tower for a short break in Barcelona in 2007, and overall would recommend it as a luxurious hotel which hits most of the 5* points.  

We wouldn't worry about the location, while it is not city centre, the metro is reliable and cheap and runs until late so this did not pose any problems.  This certainly did not impact on our stay, in fact it was nice to escape the hustle and bustle at the end of the evening.

With regard to the hotel, everything is immaculately put together in terms of the way things look, but unfortunately there are a few things that let it down.

Firstly, the lifts are a nightmare at busy times.  They operate on a swipe card system so when everybody swipes their cards to go/come back from breakfast they go mad and you are left waiting for one for ages, then it stops at all the floors!  We resorted to climbing 21 flights of stairs back to our room as we couldn't get a lift!  We felt a bit peeved at having to do this in a 5* hotel.

Secondly, we felt that the spa had been overadvertised.  Although we were aware that there was an additional charge for the spa which some people have complained about, there is basically one pool, one turkish bath bit with some jets in and the obligitary sauna and steam room.  It is no different to the Next Generation health club round the corner from our house.  If you are looking for a proper spa hotel you will be disappointed. 

While we were there there was a big conference going on, and the breakfast restaurant was closed, presumably being used for delegates.  Normal hotel guests had to eat at large tables of 10 in the conference suite a bit like a wedding, and the food was not refrigerated so was starting to sweat a bit!  When you are paying a premium for the food, this is not really satisfactory.

Generally we couldn't fault the rooms and the views over Barcelona, but there were a few little things that would be so easily corrected that made a fairly big difference to our perception of the hotel.  It's definitely set up for the business traveller, which may be worth considering before booking.",3,2008,01,17
30,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed at the Hesperia Tower over New Years 2007/2008.
Absolutely beautiful hotel, rooms felt very posh, lots of mirrors and fancy lighting.
Hotel restaurants are quite expensive - burger and chips for two cost ‚Ç¨30! But we have to say it was the best burger of all time!!!
Location is very odd, set in a residential area there is not anything around to do or see. We did venture to the residential area on our  first night in search of food and discovered a few little shops - all closed - hence the ‚Ç¨30 burgers.
Petrol station to the left of the hotel is handy for sweets, juice, water and nibbles - open 24 hours
Breakfast was expensive so we ventured to the residential shops and in daylight found a patisserrie, fantastic giant chocolate croissants ‚Ç¨1.10 each. Lack of tea making facilities had me on a Starbucks hunt , but had to wait until we got into town to find one.
Metro station is right on the doorstep so it was really easy to get into town. T10 ticket for ‚Ç¨5.90 was fab and you can use it between a few people. Metro runs all night.
Hotel room made you feel special as soon as you walk through the door. Glass lifts and glass floor with japenese garden underneath are fantastic. Fabulous views of Barcelona from the floor to ceiling windows. Great hotel away from the hustle and bustle with the comfiest beds ever.
Highly recommended.",4,2008,01,12
30,Really good time at the Tower,"We wondered what the catch was when we booked a 5* in Barcelona for considerably less than a chain hotel back in Brum however we pleased to say there wasn't one.

My wife and I concur with all the positives that have been mentioned in other reviews.  Amazing architecture in the lobby, courteous staff, extraordinary comfy beds and a brilliant shower.  
One thing I would say to other normal folks like ourselves who consider stopping in the Tower is to remember that it is 5 star  Therefore everything that isn't included is very expensive.  Breakfast at 28 euros and ¬£¬£¬£ mini bar means that unless you are very rich you need to eat and drink elsewhere.  The problem with this is the Tower is nowhere near any other amenities.  Not a great problem as the city is quite close but if you need a soft drink you need to make sure you buy one at the metro station or in the city before getting back.

I am a man of simple means so the following did not bother me at all, but if you were the sort who frequents a lot of 5* hotels I think there were some small issues that would have pushed you into thinking this was only a 4.

1) There is a glass everywhere (which makes the hotel so iconic) However one major flaw with this is that it gets dirty!  Our ceiling to floor window was very unclean, as was the lift glass
2) I ordered a bottle of wine by e-mail prior to my arrival and it wasn't in our room.
3) No gym/pool included in price
4) No coffee making facilities (take a kettle)
5) A chip in the mirror of the vanity unit.
6) They didn't leave a choccy on the bed after our very last turn down service! Disgraceful.

Don't get me wrong, Hesperia is a great place, we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. In all honesty we spent very little of it in the room because there is so much to see and do in Barcelona it would be a travesty to spend it stuck in the confines of your hotel.

One last point don't let the location put you off stopping here.  The metro is very close by and most of the time it is extremely efficient (one every 5 minutes).  The metro is a good way of getting around the city as is the tourist bus which runs from the centre of Barcelona.",4,2007,10,28
30,Five star hotel for sure...,"I won a gift certificate for one night at this lovely hotel on eBay which I used for my last night of a month-long European Tour and was rewarded with a stay far above my wildest expectations!

I had a Tower Club room, which meant I had access to a special club with a full bar and a buffet of wonderful tapas all day. This also included free access to their spa which I didn't use, and why would I? The room had the greatest bathroom I've ever seen in a Hotel (and I've stayed in a number of 5-star hotels).

The bed and furnishings were excellent, the staff exceptional and the food at both the Club Room and in the restaurant was outstanding (if slightly overpriced- even for a 5-star hotel).

It is really outside the cuty but very close to the airport and Metro. However, since the Metro closes at midnight, my guess is staying here for a Barcelona extended stay would rack up the Taxi charges.

But overall, a very fine hotel!",5,2007,10,17
30,An Architect/Designers Dream Hotel.,"We spent two wonderful nights at the Hesperia Tower Hotel en route to our holiday.  
The design of the hotel inside and out was brilliant and ultra modern, an added bonus for an Architect!  The room was very light and had wonderful views of Barcelona.  The breakfast was excellent with a wide selection of hot and cold dishes as well as cereals.  
We also had a very pleasant meal in the bar area when we arrived late in the evening.  
One problem we had was finding the stop for the Courtesy bus at the airport and had the misfortune of seeing it drive straight past us so had to take a taxi.  
With regard to the Hotel being out of the City, we found travelling to and from the City was no problem although we found it quicker to get a bus rather than the metro. 
All the staff were very courteous and extremely efficient and we look forward to returning for a longer stay.  We would not hesitate to recommend the hotel.
",5,2007,09,20
30,Absolutely Fabulous,"This is a very posh hotel, extremely well done, v courteous staff and fabulous rooms. The bathroom had the best shower I have ever been in and all bvlgari toiletries. Yes it does have a rather funny location but its only 2 minute walk to the subway and a straight train from there goes to the center of town (total journey time is 20 minutes). The breakfast is quite pricey but absolutely gorgeous spread - full english breakfast plus mounds of excellent cheeses, nuts, salads and cold cuts with all kinds of fresh juices, so well worth it. 

Only drawback, for a five star, this hotel doesnt have a pool or a gym. They do have an agreement with a fitness center behind the property, but charge guests 12 euros for its use? I thought this was a basic feature of a five star. Didnt bother us too much as we spent our time out in the city.

Overall, we would definitely go back.
",5,2007,07,18
30,Remote but luxurious,"Wonderful hotel for a conference. I stayed there for a banking conference in February and am finally getting around to writing a review. Staff is great, property is lovely and luxurious. However, it is a long train ride to downtown, probably about 30 minutes. You are close to the hard to find station. If you can get a great price and don't mind a bit of a trip to go downtown each time, this would be an excellent choice. Barcelona is a great city.
",4,2007,06,05
30,"Great Hotel, Great Value (on a weekend), Bit Far Out!","We found this hotel to be great value for money on a weekend and it is a true 5 star experience. The rooms are modern, very comfy and very stylish indeed. Breakfast is an expensive extra, so we choose to head into Barcelona on a morning and eat breakfast there, so can not comment on food. The only problem is location... it is very near the aiport and has a very regular free shuttle bus service (contact the hotel direct prior to departure for details) but it is quite a way outside of central Barcelona. 

That said the metro station is just across the street, is great value, runs from 5am till 2am each day and it only takes 20 to 25 mins to get to most central tourist spots. You will pay twice as much (on a weekend) for a central hotel which is only half as good! 

If you don't mind the metro and want a 5 star hotel that is a bargain... stay here!
",4,2007,05,22
30,Best hotel I ve ever stayed in,"I am not a connaisseur of hotels at all but have stayed in quite a few and i thought this place was excellent. Me and my boyfriend loved the deluxe room, with a great shower, views over Barcelona, plasma t.v and automatic curtains. The room service was great, with robes and slippers left by our bed every night. The staff are extremly helpful. the breakfast was pricey at about ¬£15 each per day but it was totally worth it as there was a great array on offer and it filled us up till dinner time so no need for money on lunch. (just an ice cream or snack) It was aggreed that the location was not the best , but this did not matter the metro was so cheap and easy to use and its only about 20  mins from the centre. It was actually nice to get away from the busy streets and retire at this great hotel, not without a drink at thier very plush bar first!
",5,2007,05,15
30,Great hotel in the middle of nowhere,"Stayed here for a long weekend and was very impressed by the hotel, modern, fun and great rooms sizes although it does have a bit of a conference centre feel to it. Had a room on one of the top floors which offered the most spectacular views. 

The restaurant on the roof is excellent and well worth a visit.

Only set back is that it is 25 mins cab drive from the centre and there is nothing to see in the immediate area.
",4,2007,05,14
30,"good hotel, not so good location","hesperia tower is a 5 star  hotel in a 100mr high  tower.
all very modern and stylish, you can see that it must have been designed by some famous architect . There is a famous restaurant on top of it . I did not eat there but heard enthusiastic comments about food and the spectacular view.

The hotel has some odd features like elevators that one controls from touchscreens placed on each floor. You select your destination and get in, there are actually no push buttons inside the lift. 

Rooms are spacious and comfortable - as stylish as the rest of the hotel and as odd. The entrance door opens ion a first area all steel and glass where you find  lavatories and various glass doors opening respectively on  the toilet, on a jacuzzi shower with water massage etc. , a cabinet and also the beautiful room.

The only problem of this hotel is that it is not really in barcelona, but more on the outskirts, and it takes 15-20 minutes approx. by cab to get to the city center.
",4,2007,05,10
30,Great hotel but 30 mins by metro from centre,"The hotel itself is great, we booked a 'deluxe' room not realising that this meant we would have a huge suite with lounge, dressing room, two toilets (how many hotel rooms have 2 toilets?!), a huge hydro bath tub and a fantastic shower.  There was a plasma tv in the lounge and the bedroom.  We felt thoroughly spoilt. 

We were on the 25th floor and the floor to ceiling windows were great. 

We were a little disappointed with Room Service - it was very slow - 40 minutes for a bottle of cava (and that was after we chased).   We used Room Service 4 times and the average wait was 30-40 minutes.  

The big downside of this hotel is the location.  It is very convenient for the metro (literally 3 minutes from the hotel in the car park opposite) but once you're on the metro you are talking a 30 minute (many stops) journey into Plaza Catalunya.  

There isn't much else around the hotel, just a micro mart next door (a sort of pc world crossed with currys and hmv) but no restaurants or bars.  

If you're willing to cope with the long journey into the centre then it's a great hotel.
",4,2007,05,06
30,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed at the Hesperia Tower for 4 nights at the beginning of July.  It is a wonderful hotel.  The architecture is modern and incredible.  The rooms and the public rooms are all designed to an exceptionally high modern standard.  The staff are all friendly, helpful and professional.  The staff knew us by name and they always greeted us and found us taxis etc with the utmost of courtesy.  The hotel is far out of the centre of Barcelona, but it is only 10 minutes in a taxi (‚Ç¨15) or 25 minutes on the subway (‚Ç¨1.25 single trip).  There is also a free shuttle bus service to and from the airport provided by the hotel.

We went to the hotel restauarant EVO, on the 27th floor.  An absolute experience for anyone into their food.  Expensive but worth every penny to experience Santi Santamaria's menu.

The rooms in the hotel have electronic blinds, massage shower, towelling robes, slippers, bulgari toiletries, plasma tv, but the only faults I can find is no ironing board or iron or a complimentary coffee and tea facility.  These are replaced with the rather expensive laundry service and the room service menu.  However, these are minor complaints in the grand scheme of things.

An on site spa and gym is available but there is a cost to this.  We  looked around and it did look spectacular.  

If I was to offer the management some constructive criticism it would be for them to provide the iron and ironing board, complimentary tea and coffee in the rooms.  Let the guests use the pool and gym for nothing ( I am sure they could come up with some corporate deal with the metropolitan spa next door) and also for the shuttle service to take guests into the centre of Barcelona.

Providing these extras would make this hotel  truley spectacular.  We would definately return when we go back to Barcelona.
",5,2006,07,08
30,"Fantastic Hotel, Strange Location","My wife and I stayed for long weekend at the Hesperia Tower.
We had a room on the 9th floor with far-reaching views. The hotel is new so the rooms are very modern with everything you would expect including a great walk-in massage shower. The linen and pillows were wonderful and the mini-bar fully stocked - Also had nice quiet air-con.
The piped music between your room and the lift could do with being lost however.
All the staff were very attentive and friendly.
The hotel is about half way between the airport and the city centre just off a dual carriageway and beside a large hospital. Strange location.
I suspect they are waiting on the corporate crowd to find the venue for conferences etc.... It was a bit rich to call the hotel 5 star when we were there as It was evident some of the facilities are still being built (including the rooftop restaurant)
Cabs cost between 15 and 20 euros and take 20-30 mins to the City Centre.
If you walk out the hotel and across the hospital car park there is a metro station - We bought 6 trips for less than 5 euros and the train was quicker to get to town.
As we got a great last minute deal I cannot grumble as we were paying less than average for an above average hotel - albeit halfway out of town.
Would definetley consider a re-visit - certainly if I was arranging a conference for work.

Sitting down to have a drink on the 29th floor there are always excuses that it is reserved or such, we have been there until 8:30 and if there were two tables occupied there were many. We already asked if it was from the hotel and they told us that it was external to the hotel. I hope they have more consideration for the guests. Thank you.

30,Bittersweet feeling,"My partner and I went to celebrate the end of the 2023 year, and it has been a bittersweet feeling.
We took the package that included accommodation, New Year's Eve dinner, party at the Skyfall, breakfast and brunch.
The price was really good.
The dinner was not spectacular, but it was correct.
After dinner they gave you, theoretically, a drink, party favors and grapes, to celebrate in the lobby, on a huge screen, the 12 bells.
The problem began when they also had reservations for people who were not staying at the hotel, but who later went to the party, and when we arrived we did not have party favors, because they had given them to other people.
After the grapes, supposedly when you stayed at the hotel, you could go directly to the Skyfall, where they played music, drinks, and you could dance. Our unpleasant surprise was that there was a huge queue, and they rudely told us that we had to wait in line like everyone else.
We complained to reception, because it was not logical to have to stand in the same line for people coming from outside, waiting for them to pay, when we had already paid for everything.
From reception, I have to say that they are professional and very friendly, they explained the problem to Skyfall and in the end, with a bracelet they gave us, we were able to go up.

Another problem, and this one seems serious to me, is that when we sat at a table with another couple, those organizing the party came to us, who we later learned was independent of the hotel, in a very disrespectful and rude way, they told us that We had to leave the table to other people because they had paid a fortune for that table.
We were very surprised and in order not to argue we got up.

On the other hand, in such a small place, they cannot accept so many people, since we practically couldn't move.
We ordered caipirinha and mojitos and they didn't have them.
People smoked electronic cigarettes, when theoretically it is prohibited, and they didn't say anything.

From here we want to thank Jaume, who was more or less the coordinator of everything, because he was incredibly patient, kind and professional at all times with us.
There were quite a few people who complained about the treatment received at the Skyfall, and all the help received from Jaume is appreciated.

For Skyfall my score is a resounding 0, and because I can't give a lower score.

Regarding brunch, for me it was perfect.
Very good food, lots of variety, and excellent service.

I know that Jaume informed us that Skyfall was an independent company from the hotel, but we already told him that it does not help them at all by having them in the hotel, so I really don't think we will return to the hotel.
A shame.",3,2024,01,30
30,"I recommend this hotel whether you go alone, as a couple or as a family. The next time I go to Barcelona I will definitely repeat.","My stay at this hotel has been incredible. From the first moment, unbeatable treatment from the employees. The rooms are fantastic, they have very comfortable beds and huge bathrooms. Thanks to Iv√°n for making everything so simple and pleasant for you.",5,2024,01,29
30,Awesome,"We stayed the entire weekend in a suite located on the 24th floor, the views were exceptional and the room itself was a real luxury. Apart from the accommodation we also enjoyed the breakfasts (complete and included) and visited the wonderful skyfall (stop at the obligatory hotel, a real blast) And since the best is left for last I want to make a special mention to all the staff who assisted us during our stay, from Roger, who greeted us at the door upon our arrival to the reception team through the girls who served us at breakfast, and that is if I don't want to forget the exceptional treatment we received from the director of operations Ivan Castro, always making an effort and treating us with the biggest smile, you can see that he puts a lot of care into his work and it is contagious. therefore to the rest of the staff.

We were two friends, but I think it is ideal for families and couples.

The experience is very complete, starting with a cocktail and ending with a surprise and coffee. Everything was delicious, the rice pudding dessert surprised us and we really liked it.",5,2024,01,12
30,The worst New Year's Eve of my life.,"My opinion is directed to those responsible for the management of the hotel. Because they have been the ones who have not known how to carry out or manage the New Year's Eve event, they have only cared about the monetary issue. We reserved the New Year's Eve pack because since the COVID-19 pandemic Covid we didn't go out and we thought that the hotel offered a very good option. We had been there three times when it was Hesperia Tower and we had a great time. So we didn't think about it and decided to book. The room was good, the workers were all very correct, reception, waiters and concierge. The problems started first with the welcome drink in the lobby, it was at 8:00 p.m. We went down at 7:50 p.m. and now There wasn't even room for a pin, we had to find a place to have a snack anyway. We went up to the dining room and the correct dinner, nothing out of this world. When we wanted to go down 10 minutes before 00:00 for the chimes in the Lobby, it was completely full, watching from the stairs how the people from outside were sneaking in. Taking the party favors and the free cava and those of us who had paid were disappointed by these people. But then the chaos arrived for the supposed mask party. They made us believe that In the pack we had a great New Year's Eve party. A real disaster, they made us stand in line with the people who had reserved entry to the Skifall, kids with very little education. Once at the top we sat at a table and, having the drink, they came to us Hacer telling us that it was reserved. That it had cost them 4000 euros and that we only had the right to stand on top with very bad manners. I don't know where they thought they were putting us but we saw everything and it was only for a while. They could have made us a party for all the people who booked the package in some room of the hotel and there were many of us. But they already had everything reserved privately with a few extra parties and we went to bed at 2:30 a.m. They only looked at the money and the clients that we have left money on the mmmmmm. You are going to forgive me but apologies are of no use to me. I am a Hyatt member but I am not going to return to any of your hotels. As I said, I thought I was going to have a great night but it was my worst New Year's Eve ever. Brunch is the only good taste we have had in our mouths.",3,2024,01,06
30,"Good hotel and service, chaos in the end of year package","The organization of the end-of-year package was horrible, access to the sky lasted more than an hour, with drunk external people and even worse, without anyone indicating anything or knowing how it was going (there was chaos when getting on). They asked us to leave the room before 1:00 p.m., when a late check-out until 4:00 p.m. was included. Then they acknowledged that it was their mistake. The hotel and staff were very friendly, but the organization of the package was chaos.",3,2024,01,04
30,Barcelona like you've never seen it,"The experience is great, it's like being in Alice in Wonderland, people from all over are friendly and surrounded by beautiful things, the restaurant, the spa, the surroundings. It is a unique experience. I think you experience Barcelona in a different way from this tower. Personally, I thought it was fantastic.
Waking up in the morning in this environment, observing the room and what surrounds you makes you live in a dream world.",5,2024,01,01
30,everything very good,"A very nice hotel, modern and functional with luxury everywhere.

30,Spectacular,"I recently had the opportunity to spend a night in this spectacular hotel, I must say that the treatment received by the staff was worthy of the stars it has.

30,Exceptional experience,"Last November 20th I had the pleasure of spending 1 night in this wonderful hotel. The facilities are very luxurious and the treatment of the employees is excellent.

We will be back!!",5,2023,12,02
30,Customer treatment leaves a lot to be desired for a 5 star,"My wife and I stayed for our anniversary, with a Brunch Package and Romantic Pack included. The treatment received was not what was expected of a 5 star hotel. The reception staff were very friendly, the problem was with the staff at Terrum. The hotel had a problem in its system and apparently it didn't show that we had the Brunch Package, the girl responsible for reservations in Terrum that day (November 19) instead of asking us to show her our reservation so she could check the information she easily questioned it our word, he made us wait and sat us down in a bad way. When we left the brunch they stopped us at the door and in front of everyone they said that we had not made a reservation and that they had to escort us to reception - a regrettable and 0 respectful treatment. The guy who checked us in was at the reception and immediately remembered our reservation, but his person in charge that day came back to question our reservation again, and made us show it to us several times even though it clearly said that we had the pack. We usually go to hotels in this range, I have never received such terrible treatment. Anyone can make a mistake and it is understandable, but the forms were not correct. They made us feel like we were trying to scam someone.",1,2023,11,21
30,gluten free food,"We loved the hotel, the room is great and one of us is celiac and they provided us with many facilities so that we could eat at brunch, thanks to the pastry chef and the cold room manager for their great help!!!",5,2023,11,20

30,"Hotel with high expectations, but with major flaws that should not occur in a 5-star hotel","The suite's windows were completely dirty on the outside, the sun reflected in them and you had a view of Barcelona with the dirty windows.
The welcome message was in someone else's name, I don't know if the suite was cleaned thoroughly or it was just a quick cleaning because there was dirt on the mirrors inside the room.
Ask if there is no rooftop reservation that day, we were excited to find out and it turns out that they had the entire terrace reserved and they did not notify us at any time of the suite reservation. We were left unable to go up.
Staff and attention very polite and very friendly at all times.",4,2023,10,11

Und ich fragte nur ob wir ein Zimmer in einem m√∂glichst hohem Stockwerk bekommen k√∂nnten.Das wir einen sch√∂nen Ausblick an unserer Hochzeitsjubil√§um haben.

Das Bett war auch super gem√ºtlich und einen eigenen abgetrennten Wohnbereich gab es in dieser Suite auch.

Zudem bekamen wir das Fr√ºhst√ºck f√ºr den gesammten Aufenthalt kostenlos.

In diesem Hotel ist ausserdem ein super Spa mit riesen Sauna, riesen Dampfbad, grossem Pool und grossem Jakuzzi ist im Preis inkludiert . Wie auch das Fitnesscenter.
Einfach Weltklasse.

Weiters fragte uns der Herr Rodrigo immer wieder wie es uns geht und ob wir etwas ben√∂tigen.
Egal was, wir sollten nur zu ihm kommen. 
Das nenn ich Luxus. Wenn einem jeder Wunsch erf√ºllt wird und man sich immer gut aufgehoben und beherbergt f√ºhlt.

Wir hatten eine Traumreise und sind sehr froh, sie in diesem Hotel verbracht zu haben.

Es ist noch anzumerken das die Ubahn nur vier Minuten zu Fuss vom Hotel entfernt ist. Das Ubahnnetz in Barcelona sehr gut ausgebaut ist und man nur 10 Minuten in die Stadt f√§hrt.
Kein Taxi notwendig.
Es ist auch nach den Stadtbesuchen aufgefallen, das ea besser ist wenn das Hotel ein wenig von der Stadt entfernt ist.
Denn Barcelona ist eine sehr belebte Stadt. Besonders im Ortszentrum. Das bedeutet es ust im Zentrum bis sp√§t Abends sehr laut.
So ist die Lage dieses Hotels sehr gut und mit bedacht gew√§hlt.

Ich empfehle es wirklich jedem.

Es war Ph√§nomenal.
Danke Hyatt Regency Barcelona Tower Team.

30,Muy buen hotel,"Hemos estado alojados unos d√≠as en este hotel por motivo de un evento de empresa. Las instalaciones son espectaculares, la recepci√≥n, el skyfall‚Ä¶ 
El desayuno creo que no estaba a la altura de un 5*. Faltaban cosas que suele haber. El caf√© muy mediocre. Pero el zumo muy bien. La boller√≠a era muy floja, de poca calidad. 
Sobre las habitaciones est√°n muy bien mantenidas pero est√°n algo anticuadas. Las vistas son muy buenas. Siendo hu√©sped del hotel puedes entrar al Metropolitan de al lado que es un gym y spa, que est√° muy bien. 
La limpieza durante la estancia fue perfecta tambi√©n. 
Hay que tener en cuenta que est√° bastante lejos del centro de BCN y cerca hay poco para comer. Pero est√° a pocos minutos del aeropuerto.",4,2022,10,26
30,Due notti a Barcellona nello Hyatt Regency Tower Hotel,"Le due notti passate nello Hyatt Regency Tower Hotel sono state assolutamente positive. Cordialita' e professionalita' contadistinguono il personale di questa struttura. Bellissime stanze, Colazione abbondante,  ampi spazi nelle altre aree dell'hotel tutti elementi come da tradizione negli Hyatt Hotels.
La vista dalle suite ubicate nei piani alti della struttura (io ho alloggiato al 24 piano) che si affacciano verso la citta' offrono un bel panorama , specialmente nella visione notturna. Stessa cosa dallo Skybar ubicato al 29 piano che consiglio di visitare per prendere un drink in un ambiente confortevole.",5,2022,10,24

30,Si pero No,"Llegamos casi a medianoche al anular nuestro vuelo saliendo del Prat. Fantastica la ayuda del equipo de recepcion, no recuerdo nonbres pero la chica en Recepcion lo mejor de la corta vista. La habitacion pobre, muy pobre teniendo en cuenta el precio......lo siento no fotos porque estaba cansado pero el desgaste es demasiado obvio, si quiere ser un Hyatt necesita renovar urgente. Puerta de ducha casi desplomandose de la pared...peligroso. Lastima no tener ni una miserable cerveza fria en el minibar llegando a la habitacion a esas horas en Agosto despues de estar horas en el aeropuerto. Desayuno fantastico como es habitual en Hyatt....me quedo con eso pero no volveria si no es por una urgencia como fue en esta ocasion.",3,2022,08,24

Inconveniente que tuvimos,  que el Room Service solo estuviera disponible en unas determinadas horas en lugar de las 24h de ser un hotel de 5 estrellas, por lo que al llegar tarde del aeropuerto no pudimos tomar nada hasta el d√≠a siguiente ya que se encuentra en las afueras de Barcelona y no tuvimos  tampoco ninguna otra opci√≥n cerca que no fuera ir al centro d ela ciudad, estando cansados del viaje..

30,Necesita mejorar la limpieza,"Falta de limpieza de la habitaci√≥n adecuadamente, que rezumaba olor a tabaco. En el detector de humos, estaba enrollado un calcet√≠n para inhibir su acci√≥n. La habitaci√≥n no estaba adecuadamente limpia y no hab√≠a sido debidamente revisada como corresponde a un hotel de 5 estrellas. Nos ha resultado una experiencia decepcionante. Hemos de hacer la salvedad del excelente trato de la camarera de cafeter√≠a, que ha sido exquisita en trato, como corresponder√≠a a un hotel de esa categor√≠a",2,2021,12,07
30,Ideales Tagungs- und Veranstaltungshotel,"Das Hotel liegt am s√ºdwestlichen Stadtrand von Barcelona bei den Universit√§tskliniken (Belverdere), nicht allzu weit weg vom Flughafen. Dieser l√§sst sich mit dem Bus 46 oder Taxi in 10min erreichen. Der Anschluss in die Innenstadt ist mit der U-bahn bequem m√∂glich (Linie 1). Die Station ist dem Hotel direkt gegen√ºber. Fahrtzeit  zum Plaza Catalunia ca. 30 min. In der direkten Umgebung des Hotels gibt es einen kleinen Park und einige kleine Gesch√§fte sowie zwei lokale Restaurants, ansonsten ist die Umgebung aber nicht sehr attraktiv (Plattenbauten, Hauptverkehrsstrassen). 
Das Hotel ist sehr gro√üz√ºgig gestaltet und ideal f√ºr Veranstaltungen. Die Zimmer sind ger√§umig und sehr gut gepflegt. Der mit schwarzem Granit gestaltete Bade- und Ankleidebereich ist sehr sch√∂n. Die Aussicht aus den bodentiefen Panoramafenstern ist gerade aus den oberen der 25 Stockwerke atemberaubend. Ein Highlight ist sicherlich auch das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet, das nicht nur internationale Speisen, sondern besonders auch regionale Spezialit√§ten bietet.

En rescepcion no querian hacer nada, pusimos libro de reclamaciones, llamamos a sanidad. Un hotel de lujo no puede tener este descuido. Ademas, en vez de pedir perdon.o arreglarlo sin mas nos han dicho que ya nos dirian alguna cosa, pero yo he tenido que pagar como si estuviera en condiciones.  y no pondre nada mas ya que se encargara sanidad de ir",1,2020,02,16

30,5 stelle fuori Barcellona ,"Qualit√† prezzo √® un hotel eccezionale. Lussuoso, camere molto spaziose (nonostante non abbiamo preso una superior), reception gentile e cortese, non abbiamo provato i servizi collegati visto che dovevamo visitare Barcellona. La metro Hospital de Bellvitge (capolinea linea rossa) si trova a 300 metri nel parcheggio dell'universit√†. Unica pecca la distanza dal centro, 20 minuti di metro per arrivare a piazza Catalunya, ma la metro a Barcellona funziona benissimo.

30,Solo para negocios,"El hotel esta lejos de todo salvo del hospital de Bellvitge. En cuanto a las habitaciones est√°n muy bien, amplias, limpias y c√≥modas, el ba√±o tambien muy amplio. En cuanto a las zonas comunes tengo q decir q cuenta con varios restaurantes, un bar en el hall y en el √°tico un restaurante que pasadas las 12:00 se convierte en un bar de copas, eso si muy desanjelado y y frio, las dos noches q fui no hab√≠a nadie.
El bufet de desayuno correcto sin mas. El servicio de recepci√≥n muy atento y servicial.
Lo dicho salvo q vayas al hospital esta muy desubicado de todo.

30,Sehr sauberes Hotel,Wir waren f√ºnf Tage in diesem Hotel. Wir hatten eine Suiten-Duplex King im 25 Stock mit einem traumhaften Blick in die City. Die Suite is zweist√∂ckig was mir sehr gut gefiel und es gibt eine Badewanne mit Ausblick. Sehr sauberes Zimmer. Wir benutzten jeden Tag die Tower Lounge wo es ein kleines aber feines Fr√ºhst√ºck gab. Da das Hotel sehr nahe am Flughafen ist mussten wir jeden Tag die Metro in die Stadt nehmen. Metro Station 5min zu Fuss man ist in 25 min in der Stadt da die Verbindungen super sind hat uns das nicht gest√∂rt. Ein Kompliment an die Mitarbeiter des Hotels sind alle sehr freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit . Ich w√ºrde es sofort wieder buchen.,4,2019,05,29

Non una vista mozzafiato ma dall'alto fa effetto. Stanze molto belle, curate in ogni dettaglio! Prezzi in linea per essere un 5 stelle. Sicuramente ci tornerei.",5,2019,05,14
30,ottima base vicino all'aeroporto,"L'albergo √© abbastanza isolato ma in ottima posizione per andare all'aeroporto. Offre molti servizi di buona qualit√† sia come ristoranti sia come bar. La suite al 25 piano era molto grande e ben curata, il bagno era ampio con una bella vasca ed una doccia separata. In pi√π aveva una vista ampissima su Barcellona. Peccato per√≤ che non ci fosse modo di cambiare aria facendo entrare aria fresca. Bisognava necessariamente usare l'aria condizionata e francamente dall'odore non mi sembrava pulitissima. Ho preferito lasciarla spenta. Il problema del mantenimento della pulizia dei filtri dei sistemi di aria condizionata di ampie dimensioni √© un tema che andrebbe curato maggiormente negli alberghi per ovvi motivi di igiene. In generale poi preferisco sempre le normali finestre per il ricambio d'aria. A parte questo aspetto l'esperienza √® stata piacevole",4,2019,04,18

30,Nah am Flughafen,"Das Hotel ist nah am Flughafen, also nichts f√ºr Leute die zu Fu√ü oder Public in die Stadt oder an den Strand wollen. Die Zimmer sind gro√ü aber bei Tageslicht schon ganz sch√∂n sch√§big, inclusive jede Menge Flecken auf dem Teppichboden. Schlimm fand ich die Aufz√ºge die morgens komplett √ºberlastet waren. 10 Minuten Wartezeit + Anhalten auf jedem Stockwerk und das bei 24 Stockwerken ist richtig nervig. Wenn man in der N√§he einen Businesstermin hat, ist das Hotel ok. Aussuchen w√ºrde ich mir das Hotel nicht.",3,2019,02,13

Cenamos all√≠ mismo y estuvo todo correctisimo a muy buen precio",5,2019,02,07
30,19 ore da sogno!,"Ho scelto questo albergo per la vicinanza all‚Äôaeroporto visto che il nostro scalo a Barcellona era di 19 ore e alle 4 dovevamo recarci in aeroporto.
l‚Äôalbergo √® bellissimo √® dotato di tutti i confort, le parti comuni sono accoglienti pulite, il personale della reception √® molto gentile e sempre disponibile per le mie richieste. 
la stanza molto bella con una vista sulla citt√† incredibile mi dispiace non aver goduto dei servizi per il tempo limitato.
Anche se distante dal cento ha la metro vicino e quindi in 15-20 minuti sei in centro 
lo consiglio per due motivi 
1 rapporto qualit√† servizi-prezzo 
2 √® molto vicino alla stazione.",5,2019,02,04
30,Auf den ersten Blick ok aber dann.....,"√úber Geschmack l√§sst sich angeblich streiten. Modernes Hotel mit 28 Etagen. Alles sehr dunkel gehalten. Die B√§der in den Zimmern sind total in Schwarz gehalten und verspiegelt. Man kommt sich vor wie in einem Spiegelkabinett. In einem Hotel bei dieser Preislage bei dem man Sauna und Gym extra zahlen muss und das Fr√ºhst√ºck f√ºr 23‚Ç¨ nicht dem Preis entspricht, kann man sich nicht wohl f√ºhlen. Das Hotel war vielleicht mal gut aber die Tage sind vorbei. Die Teppiche in der Lobbybar stehen vor Dreck und sind √ºberflutet von Flecken. Die Sitze der Lobbybar sind so abgenutzt das man schon die einzelnen Webf√§den sehen kann. Die Bedienung an der Lobbybar ignoriert den Gast und man muss sich schon bemerkbar machen wenn man etwas bestellen will. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist durchschnittlich. Es gibt zwar fast Alles aber mit Abstrichen. Keine frische Butter. Wenig Auswahl an Brot und Br√∂tchen. S√º√üe St√ºckchen und Kuchen dagegen in Massen. Joghurt aus Bechern ist Chemie pur und M√ºsli gibt es nicht frisch. Nur Fertigprodukte wie gezuckerte Haferflocken oder Crisps. Ok - Obst gibt es frisch aber auch wenig Auswahl. Marmelade sind Fertigprodukte in Sch√ºsseln oder in abgepackten kleinen Gl√§sern. Alles im Allem nichts f√ºr den Genie√üer. Zudem ist die Lage eine Katastrophe. In einem abgewrackten Viertel mit gro√üen Wohnblocks. Viele Hunde und sehr schmutzig. Wenig einladende Restaurants eher Schnellimbiss Charme. Also Fr√ºhst√ºck drau√üen auch nix.
Eben ein Hotel nahe am Flughafen und am Messegel√§nde. Ausgelegt f√ºr Businesskunden, Messebesucher und f√ºr den Kurzaufenthalt zwischen zwei Fl√ºgen. Die Hotels in der Stadt haben da mehr zu bieten f√ºr den gleichen Preis. Keine Empfehlung.",3,2019,01,29

30,Parking deficiente,"Mi opini√≥n es exclusivamente del parking. Lo uso varias veces por semana as√≠ que mi valoraci√≥n no es por algo puntual.

Puedo asegurar que de las 3 maquinas que tiene para pagar, la que est√° ubicada en el acceso al gimnasio, lleva mas de un a√±o en el cual no ha estado un mes entero sin averiarse. De hecho, ahora lleva estropeada unas dos semanas, que yo sepa.
Las otras dos maquinas est√°n en la otra punta del parking y casualmente ahora mismo solo funciona una. 

As√≠ que nos encontramos en el aparcamiento de un hotel de 5 estrellas en el cual actualmente a 24/01/2019 solo funciona 1 de las 3 maquinas de pago; una de las cuales est√° estropeada habitualmente.",1,2019,01,24

un ottimo ristorante al 2nd piano e drink club in attico credo 30esimo piano.

Como sucede en estos casos de caos total, la regla dice que hay que culpar al sistema de c√≥mputo y eso hicieron. Me dieron otro cuarto, pero esta vez un empleado me acompa√±√≥ para cerciorarse de que estaba vac√≠o. Me qued√© con la idea de que me podr√≠a pasar algo similar esa noche m√°s tarde: una visita inesperada. Los elevadores merecen menci√≥n aparte. Se controlan con una pantalla y resulta dif√≠cil entender el funcionamiento. S√≥lo para apantallar... Otro detalle inaceptable: alfombras en las habitaciones muy manchadas. Da cierto asco.

30,Cinque stelle? ,"La capacit√† ricettiva di Barcelona √® davvero grande. Questo albergo delude un po' per la moquette abbastanza usata di alcune camere, i rumori degli scarichi della doccia, i costi esagerati del frigobar.

30,Hotel de lujo para negocios.,"Me hospedo en este hotel un par de veces al a√±o desde hace alg√∫n tiempo y puedo decir que lo conozco bien. As√≠, voy a contaros lo que conozco de un establecimiento elegante, espacioso y acondicionado para el viajero de negocios. 
Una de las primeras cosas que un viajero se pregunta cuando busca un hotel es si su ubicaci√≥n es buena; en √©ste caso la respuesta es ¬∑depende de ""para qu√©"". El hotel se encuentra en Hospitalet de Llobregat, muy cerca del recinto ferial Fira de Barcelona pero no se encuentra especialmente bien comunicado  si el objetivo no es hacer negocios y s√≠ llegar cuanto antes al centro de Barcelona. Es un hotel muy visible desde muchas partes de la ciudad dada su altura, aunque las vistas que ofrecen las habitaciones m√°s altas no son una maravilla. Pero entremos al hotel y lo primero que gusta es un hall amplio, elegante dotado de un bar, zonas de espera y ocio y zonas donde reunirte para charlar lejos del ajetreo de las horas punta de check in y check out. El precio de las habitaciones es razonable y su dise√±o confortable, con buenos acabados, decoraci√≥n moderna y ba√±os completos con amenities de calidad. Pero sin duda, son dos cosas las que hacen de √©ste hotel una joya interesante. En primer lugar, el establecimiento dispone de una modalidad de habitaciones en las plantas superiores que ofrecen acceso a una zona privada dotada de salas de reuniones independientes, espacios para leer o relajarse y una zona de barra libre de bebida y algunos aperitivos, todo gratuito. Esta misma categor√≠a de habitaciones ofrece acceso gratuito al Metropolitan, una mezcla de Spa y gimnasio que se encuentra en un edificio anexo comunicado con el hotel. Unas instalaciones muy completas a las que se suma una excelente oferta gastron√≥mica y un desayuno en la c√∫pula del edificio que completa una experiencia diferente.Visitad tambi√© el bar de las planta superior, que ofrece una panor√°mica de 360 de la ciudad y unos c√≥cteles acepetbles calidad/precio. Recomendaci√≥n: si os pod√©is permitir pagar un poco m√°s elegid las habitaciones con acceso a esa zona VIP y al Metropolitan porque sea un viaje de negocios o una pareja que quiera pasar un fin de semana rom√°ntico sin tener que salir del hotel, la exclusividad y la calidad siempre se agradecen.",4,2018,10,08
30,Un lujo a precio asequible,"Hotel moderno, amplio y con excelentes vistas de Barcelona, esta alejado del centro pero bien comunicado y con un amplio parking. Dispone de todas las comodidades y habitaciones para todos los gustos y precios. Personalmente reserve una Suite y estuve muy a gusto disfrutando de su comodidad, sus vistas, la tarjeta club Tower y el acceso al Metropolitan GYM con su SPA.
La relaci√≥n calidad / precio de este emblematico hotel me parece excelente.
El unic√≥ punto negativo es que el acceso al Club Tower presenta dificultades a la hora de abrir la puerta que cuesta de abrir y puede parecer que esta cerrado.",4,2018,10,08
30,convention,"la struttura √® davvero bella ed originale. per le stanze, io ne avevo una al 13mo piano,  si deve fare un distinguo: la zona bagno moderna e bellissima mentre la zona notte andrebbe rivista quantomeno per togliere la moquette che ormai √® obsoleta e poco igienica. Altro neo per un turista che sta solo un we √® la distanza dal centro che si raggiunge comunque facilmente con la metro (1/2 ora + 5 minuti per raggiungere la stazione) o con i taxi che impiegano pi√π o meno la met√† del tempo.",4,2018,10,05
30,Viaggio di lavoro,"Ho soggiornato qui per 4 notti per una convention con camera al 16imo piano.
La hall √® molto accogliente, gli ascensori computerizzati per velocizzare l‚Äôattesa (non si velocizza nulla)
Appena sono entrata in camera ho borita a destra il bagno, molto spazioso ma senza una porta d‚Äôingresso, diciamo a giorno,con pavimento nero a specchio. Se avessi condiviso la camera con una collega non sarebbe stato molto comodo.
In camera c‚Äô√® una moquette datata con diverse macchie e odore di polvere e di chiuso.
Il suggerimento √® di sostituirla con un pavimento diverso perch√© √® un peccato che una bella camera perda il suo fascino per questo problema",3,2018,10,02
30,convention,Albergo vicino alla metro ma lontano dal centro se volete andare con i mezzi. alternativa √© il taxi con un costo medio di 10 euro .

30,Location non turistica,"Ogni 40‚Äô c‚Äô√® una navetta gratuita da/per l‚Äôaeroporto a circa 10‚Äô d‚Äôauto dall‚Äôhotel (ma nelle camere non si sente alcun rumore degli aerei). Parcheggio a pagamento. Passando dall‚Äôesterno si accede a una ampia e molto attrezzata spa/ palestra/ estetica aperta anche a esterni (Metropolitan) che agli ospiti vista 12‚Ç¨, a mio avviso ben spese vista l‚Äôofferta di servizi presenti ma piuttosto affollata. Solo nel weekend √® aperto il ristorante a cupola al piano pi√π alto, per gli altri giorni c‚Äô√® il bouquet al secondo piano, molto buono anche se non certo economico (difficile spendere meno di 35‚Ç¨/testa). L‚Äôhotel √à di fronte all universit√† e a pochi passi dal capolinea della metro rossa che porta in centro ma non lo consiglierei per un turista che vuole vedere la citt√† in quanto nelle vicinanze non c‚Äô√® proprio nulla. Molto pulito e camere ampie con finestre da soffitto a pavimento (vista traffico della gran via e zona residenziale popolare). Buona e basta in offerta la colazione a buffet. Ottimo personale.

Sehr gutes reichhaltiges Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet und die Bar im Ufo auf dem Dach ist ein Highlight und die Drinks nicht zu teuer. Wenn es halt nur nicht so weit von der Innenstadt weg w√§re.

30,No est√° a la altura!,"Despu√©s de hacernos perder un d√≠a de nuestras vacaciones, Vueling nos hizo pasar la noche en este Hotel cerca del aeropuerto. En un principio piensas que como es un 5 Estrellas quieren compensar el da√±o que te han causado pero luego salvo por las instalaciones, el trato recibido deja mucho que desear... La cena que nos ofrecieron no es propia de un establecimiento de esta categor√≠a, a decir verdad fu√© mucho peor que en cualquier Fast Food de la ciudad, y por la ma√±ana tras el madrug√≥n al que nos obligaba el nuevo vuelo, el desayuno que ten√≠amos encargado no estaba preparado y tuvimos que marcharnos en ayunas!!!

Una vez hice el cheking tuve q seguir cargado con el ni√±o y nadie me ayudo a llevarlas al ascensor ni con las mochilas, algo que te esperas de un hotel de 3*, no de uno de ‚Äú5*‚Äù. Luego en la habitacion lo mismo, nadie te explica nada y tienes que andar buscando las cosas interruptores, persianas, etc.
En fin, un desastre. Como 3-4 estrellas no me parece mal, pero 5 estrellas no tiene ni de lejos, en barcelona por el mismo prexio tienes muchos mas donde te hacen sentir una verdadera experiencia de 5*, no recomiendo este hotel si lo que buscas es sentir que estas en un hotel de lujo.
Lo unico que estuvo bien fue el desayuno.",1,2018,08,30
30,Horrible experiencia,"Hicimos la reserva con desayuno incluido y al llegar nos dijeron que a ellos no les constaba. De muy malas maneras nos instaron a contactar con la plataforma mediante la cual hab√≠amos hecho la reserva, quit√°ndose todo tipo de responsabilidad. Hotel de 5 estrellas muy justitas. Todos los servicios eran de pago, incluidos la piscina y el gimnasio, que adem√°s est√°n en local aparte. Publicidad enga√±osa mediante fotograf√≠as que te hacen pensar que esos servicios est√°n incluidos. Pedimos las hojas de reclamaciones oficiales y en un principio nos sacaron unas hojas de sugerencias internas.

30,Vistas impresionantes desde un hotel muy recomendable,"Pasamos s√≥lo una noche en el NH Collection Tower, pero nos qued√≥ mucha pena cuando nos fuimos. El d√≠a de llegada se complic√≥ un poco y al final ser√≠an las once de la noche cuando hicimos el check in. Para nuestra sorpresa, a pesar de que ten√≠amos una reserva normal, nos asignaron una suite d√∫plex situada en la planta 25, con unas vistas incre√≠bles. Jacuzzi al lado de una velux enorme, etc, etc. Evidentemente, no es f√°cil describir con palabras algo tan impresionante, con lo que no cuentas y que, adem√°s, te sale completamente gratis.

¬øQu√© puedo decir acerca del personal de recepci√≥n despu√©s de que nos diese esa habitaci√≥n? Perfecto!!

En cuanto al desayuno, muy completo y bien atendido.

Nos alojamos en una de las habitaciones superiores y tuvimos que averiguar por nuestra cuenta con qu√© privilegios cont√°bamos. Ten√≠amos las expectativas muy altas y nuestra estancia result√≥ decepcionante.",3,2018,08,02
30,¬°Muy bueno! Con servicio gratuito al aeropuerto,"Si bien el motivo del viaje fue para descansar previo para un vuelo, elegimos este hotel por una buena oferta en booking.

Las habitaciones muy bien acabadas con una excelente cama, un cuarto de ba√±o de lujo, con complementos como el bat√≠n, toallas, zapatillas, entre otros elementos.
Los/las recepcionistas fueron amables y atentos en todo momento y cabe destacar el servicio gratuito al aeropuerto que aunque te deje en la T1, pues viene bien en verdad.

30,Vistas espectaculares,"El hotel se encuentra a 5 minutos a pie del Hospital de Beltvitge. Estuve con mi madre, que ten√≠a una cita en el hospital temprano por la ma√±ana y vive en Zaragoza. La experiencia fue muy buena, sobre todo las vistas desde el piso 22 donde estabamos alojadas. La ventana ocupa toda la pared de lado a lado y de suelo a techo por lo que si mantienes abierta la cortina parece que estes durmiendo en el cielo.
Las sabanas, colchones y almohadas de calidad, muy c√≥modo. No se oye ni un ruido.
La disposici√≥n del ba√±o, que precede a la habitaci√≥n en un espacio abierto, es muy original, sin embargo al ser todo espejos y superficies negras reflectantes se hac√≠a un poco dificil para mi madre con visi√≥n reducida. 
El desayuno muy bueno, personal muy atento.",5,2018,07,25

30,Espectacular servicio y estado de las habitaciones,"Suelo viajar a menudo a Barcelona, y creo que este Hotel es la mejor opci√≥n  para hospedarse por servicio, estado de las habitaciones y ubicaci√≥n.

30,"Fuimos por un concierto, visita express","Hotel muy bonito, habitaci√≥n propia de un 5 estrellas, ubicaci√≥n alejada de la civilizaci√≥n, a unos 7 kms del centro. El bar es muy sobrio, sin vida, carta excesivamente cara. La habitaci√≥n no hab√≠a sido revisada, pues faltaban productos en el minibar y alg√∫n que otro detallito, cosa que no nos import√≥ pues apenas pasamos tiempo en el Hotel. El hotel cuenta con un servicio transfer al aeropuerto, por cierto, el chico muy profesional y majo.
La limpieza impecable, tanto en habitaci√≥n como en zonas comunes, el mobiliario quiz√°s un pel√≠n anticuado pero muy bonito, el colch√≥n muy c√≥modo. La √∫nica nota negativa que en cierto modo ha oscurecido nuestra fugaz estancia ha sido la misma ma√±ana del checkout, una de las chicas ha entrado a comprobar el mini bar, faltando una de las bebidas, seg√∫n nos dec√≠a, consumici√≥n que no hemos hecho. Esta chica se va y nosotros seguimos empacando, entonces para nuestra sorpresa viene otra chica a comprobar el minibar, sin permiso entra y una vez dentro nos explica el motivo de su entrada ( en ese momento vest√≠a una toalla). La situaci√≥n ha sido muy violenta y mi pareja le ha pedido que volviera una vez hubi√©ramos salido, (pues ya nos hab√≠an revisado el bar y no hab√≠amos consumido la coca cola que dec√≠an faltaba). La chica se marcho inmediatamente. A excepci√≥n de este episodio, el personal es correcto, amable aunque no se siente cercano.
Sobre las dem√°s prestaciones, restaurante, gimnasio-spa no sabemos por falta de tiempo pero nos hubiera encantado conocer, quiz√°s con m√°s calma, en nuestra pr√≥xima visita a esta bonita tierra.",3,2018,07,11
30,Piacevole sorpresa ,"Letto comodo, colazione abbondante e ottima,  ma cena in hotel cara e niente di speciale. L‚Äôingresso alla spa, palestra e piscina costa 12 euro al giorno, ma ne vale la pena, attrezzi modernissimi e tutto ben organizzato . Sulla destra dell‚Äôingresso ci sono delle case e nella via pedonale situata in mezzo, tanti negozietti di frutta e vari generi alimentari di ottima qualit√† e a prezzi bassissimi. Dall‚Äôaeroporto navetta gratuita molto comoda. Per andare in centro metropolitana vicino, ma per arrivare in piazza Catalunya ci vuole un po‚Äô di pazienza, circa 15/20 minuti. Il venerd√¨ e il sabato sera dalle 10:00 pm alle 3:00 am √® aperto il piano bar panoramico al 29esimo piano ... ne vale la pena fare un salto.",5,2018,07,06

Repetiremos pronto!",5,2018,07,02
30,Carencias,"Me qued√© un poco decepcionado por una publicidad algo incompleta respecto a los servicios que prestan. La elecci√≥n del hotel la hice por su servicio de transfer con el aeropuerto, y oh sorpresa!!!, solo va a la T1 y con un horario bastante reducido, el √∫ltimo bus es 19:30-20:00h , as√≠ que a pagar taxi!! Y el horario de la ma√±ana tambi√©n es bastante limitado, no permiten reservar el horario del bus, as√≠ que hay que hacer cola anticipadamente para no quedarte en tierra! Las habitaciones est√°n francamente bien, muy buenas vistas y muy c√≥modas y completas, el entorno del hotel invita poco a pasear y la c√∫pula con las mejores vistas la ten√≠an cerrada un domingo tarde! La relaci√≥n calidad precio es muy buena , pero si sumas taxis y distancia a cualquier parte ya cambia la cosa... De todas maneras lo recomiendo si vas de paso para el aeropuerto o para alguna gesti√≥n r√°pida en Barcelona. No tiene piscina ni terrazas exteriores o yo no las vi... ",4,2018,06,28
30,Gesti√≥n lamentable del p√°rking del hotel,"He pagado con un billete de 10 euros el coste de 4 euros de p√°rquing y la m√°quina no me ha devuelto el cambio de 6 euros. Cuando he llamado al timbre me han dicho que fuera a la recepci√≥n del hotel. Despu√©s de hacerme esperar 15 minutos all√≠ me han devuelto 4 euros en lugar de los 6 que me correspond√≠an. Cuando luego en casa he hecho cuentas y he visto que en recepci√≥n se hab√≠an equivocado he llamado para que me devolvieran los 2 euros que faltaban y, a pesar de darme la raz√≥n, me han dicho que la √∫nica manera de recuperarlos era ir personalmente al hotel. Obviamente, por esa cantidad no voy a hacer un viaje de ida y vuelta de m√°s de una hora. Replant√©ense su pol√≠tica de atenci√≥n al cliente.",1,2018,06,27
30,Hotel recomendable ,Muy buena la habitaci√≥n y limpia. El personal muy amable y atento. El √∫nico pero el cuarto de ba√±o falta algo de luz. Muy buenas las almohadas que para mi son importantes. La habitaci√≥n bien insonorizada y el aire acondicionado bueno.,4,2018,06,24
30,Quando cancellano il volo e ti piazzano,Gran bel posto molto curato . 29 piani da bocca aperta. Unico punto nero che si trova lontano dal centro. A suo favore i vari autobus che ti portano in centro o alla metropolitana . La vista dai piani alti e da mozzafiato .,4,2018,06,18
30,Zwischen Flughafen und Stadt,"Ich war im Rahmen einer Konferenz im NH Barcelona Tower, hierf√ºr ist das Hotel eine geeignete Location. Nur ein paar Kilometer vom Flughafen entfernt und an der Haupteinfallstra√üe gelegen ist man in 10-15 Minuten dort. Das Hochhaus mit viel Glas und dem ""Dome"" mit einer Bar oben drauf sieht man schon von weitem und ist eine architektonische Besonderheit. 

Die Zimmer sind ger√§umig und modern eingerichtet, das Fr√ºhst√ºck vielf√§ltig und dem Hotelstandard angemessen. Wenn man etwas bem√§ngeln will, dann ist es die Anzahl der Aufz√ºge. Gemessen an der Zimmeranzahl und der Stockwerke sind die vier Aufz√ºge bei gr√∂√üerem Andrang schnell √ºberlastet und das gro√üe Warten beginnt ...

F√ºr touristische Aufenthalte ist das Hotel ohne Frage auch geeignet, liegt jedoch ein ganzes St√ºck von der Innenstadt entfernt in einer insgesamt unattraktiven Umgebung. Praktischerweise liegt die Endstation der U-Bahn Linie L1 nur ein paar hundert Meter vom Hotel entfernt, sind dann aber 20-25 Min Fahrt bis in die Innenstadt.",4,2018,06,17

30,Hotel raffinato,"Causa sciopero dei controllori di volo, ci hanno fatto pernottare all'NH Hotel, la struttura √® maestosa e molto elegante. Camere spaziose e comode con un vista, per noi che stavamo al 23esimo piano, davvero mozzafiato su Barcellona. La cena offerta la sera faceva ridere e conisteva in una pizza surgelata una mela e dell'acqua, ma non √® da imputare all'hotel ma bens√¨ alla compagnia aerea. Colazione ricca e a buffet. Sicuramente non √® l'hotel ideale per una vacanza a Barca perch√® l'hotel √® dislocato nella peferiferia di Barcellona, ma almeno c'√® vicino la metro e in 20 minuti circa si arriva in plaza de catalunya.",4,2018,05,30
30,Entrare nella stanza √® un altro momento da ricordare.,"che dire? Alloggiare al ventesimo piano?
Gli ascensori ‚Äì soprattutto in discesa ‚Äì si comandano per mezzo di un computerino posto tra le 4 cabine.

Si trova di tutto, l‚Äôatmosfera √® calda e ombrata, gentilezza aleggia nell‚Äôaria.
Entrare nella stanza √® un altro momento da ricordare.
Dopo aver introdotto la card, ci si ritrova in un bagno di specchi, legni, riflessi, dove alcuni elementi emergono da un‚Äôovattata oscurit√†. Specchi scivolano su s√® stessi per rivelare appendiabiti e cassetti, uno spogliatoio.

30,Muy bueno!,"Me hosped√© 3 noches. No frecuento esta calidad de hoteles habitualmente. Lo hice porque no hab√≠a lugar a buen precio en hoteles c√©ntricos ya que era un fin de semana largo, y este hotel, estaba con una buena promoci√≥n. Si bien est√° alejado del centro de Barcelona, se puede llegar en 25 minutos en subte, que est√° a pocos metros.. (Tampoco tomo taxis. Prefiero el transporte p√∫blico). Es un verdadero 5 estrellas. Tiene gym; pileta. Las habitaciones amplias, con batas. No contrat√© desayuno .Sal√≠a car√≠simo!!! Debo decir que al contratarlo en promoci√≥n, me dieron una habitaci√≥n con la alfombra manchada, lo cual no era problema para mi, pero en esta categor√≠a , deber√≠an cuidar los detalles.

y la tercera  aunque por ella el hotel dira ... vaya si esta aqu√≠ el SR ..  ejem .. 
Continuo de la primera aunque  hospitalet  no es el sitio mejor para ir a tu ciudad de vacaciones PERO eso no es lo importante tu llega , que si estas un poco lejos sonm capaces de irte a buscar ...
la segunda con 5 dias por que su acceso a ese club que tienen hasta pistachos pelados!!!
y la tercera por que ellos mismo se encargaron de tramitar resolver y gestionar  mi entrada y sal√≠a del hotel y es mas de llevarme en un taxi a mi domicilio.
no sabr√≠a que definir del hotel 
LO PRIMORDIAL ES QUE GRACIAS A SITIOS COMO NH TOWER

30,Escapada en NH Collection Tower,"Buen hotel y buen servicio en general.

- Check-in/Check-out: R√°pido, √°giles y muy atentos con el hu√©sped.
- Habitaci√≥n: Alojado en la Suite D√∫plex y pr√°cticamente en lo m√°s alto de NH Collection Tower, te encuentras una habitaci√≥n dividida en dos estancias. La sala de estar y un ba√±o sencillo en la planta inferior, y la planta superior dotada de cama y ba√±o completo. La verdad es que teniendo una ba√±era de hidromasaje a pies del Sky-line de la ciudad es un plus importante. La habitaci√≥n y sus vistas ganan y se disfruta mucho m√°s de noche que de d√≠a. Como aspectos de mejora que aprecio claramente en la habitaci√≥n es plantearse sinceramente una renovaci√≥n/actualizaci√≥n parcial. El desgaste del mobiliario y habitaci√≥n al cu√°l el paso de los a√±os ha sido sometida es m√°s que evidente (No s√≥lo por marcos de puerta bufados de humedad cercano a la ducha...). Seguidamente, el tipo de mueble en los que el color tan oscuro no le da el toque moderno, actual y vanguardista...as√≠ como sof√°s y elementos de decoraci√≥n. Por √∫ltimo, la habitaci√≥n tuve la sensaci√≥n que llevaba tiempo cerrada por el polvo que presentaba. Desde mi punto de vista, deber√≠an a√±adir un control para asegurarse de limpiar/repasar de nuevo las habitaciones antes de asignarlas a un hu√©sped aunque ya estuviera preparada. Adicionalmente, una papelera del ba√±o su pedal de apertura estaba con suciedad incrustada. Son por ejemplo detalles que en un cinco estrellas y en una de las mejores habitaciones no te deber√≠as encontrar nunca. Por √∫ltimo, la cama y pese a que el sue√±o fue correcto, ech√© en falta un colch√≥n mucho m√°s c√≥modo y unas almohadas de m√°s calidad.
- Instalaciones: En general, preciosas y muy bonitas. Ascensores potentes y muy r√°pidos.
- Restauraci√≥n: Para m√≠, lo mejor con mucha diferencia del hotel. Tanto el restaurante Bouquet que tuve una cena exquisita, deliciosa y con personal muy atento, as√≠ como el Restaurante Buffet de desauyuno que gozaba de gran variedad de productos fr√≠os, calientes, boller√≠a, pan, etc√©tera. 

En resumen: Notable experiencia en los que salvo los detalles rese√±ados de la limpieza de habitaci√≥n que deber√≠an revisarse y adaptar dada la categor√≠a del hotel, es una apuesta que cumple aunque es necesario apostar por la mejora cont√≠nua.",4,2018,05,07
30,Experiencia pat√®tica,"Mis amigos de Vueling nos alojaron en este ""maravilloso"" hotel despues de hacernos perder todo un dia de vacaciones, sin ning√πn tipo de informaci√≤n. Tenemos cena y desayuno incluidos.
Llegamos en autobus al hotel a las 22.15 de la noche y lo primero que nos dicen al registrarnos es que la cena es hasta las 22.30.
El hotel tiene veintitantas plantas y nos envian a una de las √πltimas, osea que tenemos 15 minutos para pelearnos con el ascensor, encontrar la habitaci√≤n, dejar las maletas, encontrar el comedor y cenar....... sube , baja,  uffff, de infarto total.

La cena.... bueno, sin comentarios, pero despues de todo el dia en el aeropuerto, sin probar bocado, menos es nada.
Al final nos dieron un poco mas de tiempo de las diez y media, pero se notaba a las leguas que estaban deseando que nos fueramos. Por cierto al comer tan r√†pido me sent√≤ fatal.

Me imagino que saben lo que pasa en el prat, y si se comprometen a dar un servicio a las compa√±ias aereas tendr√†n que amoldarse un poco a la situaci√≤n en la que nos encontramos los viajeros.... que bastante puteados estamos ya.
Nada, cero comprensi√≤n.

Ahora viene lo bueno; nos meten en una super suite con vistas, enorme, impresionante, pero que apesta a tabaco , apesta ya desde el hall del ascensor.
Me sorprende bastante que lo primero que te encuentras al entrar en la habitaci√≤n es un cartelito diciendo que est√†n comprometidos con el medio ambiente, blablabla...que no cambian las s√†banas ni las toallas a diario  blablabla.... pero en cambio su compromiso con el medio ambiente, permite fumar y que tu sin comerlo ni beberlo tengas que soportarlo, pat√®tico.  

No se si el hotel tiene alguna zona exclusiva para fumadores, pero lo l√≤gico es que si te van a meter en una habitaci√≤n as√¨, que te avisen o te consulten por lo menos, ya que existe una ley que protege a los no fumadores.

Alguien debi√≤ de llamar a recepci√≤n para quejarse porque abren una puerta  exterior en el hall del ascensor, pero solo airea el pasillo. Yo iba a llamar tambien pero ya ni me molesto, porque son las 12 de la noche y a las 4 me tengo que levantar,  y lo √πnico que quiero es dormir.

En definitiva, la experiencia pat√®tica y lamentable, porque no pegamos ojo en toda la noche con el pestazo a tabaco impregnado en toda la suite,en las cortinas, en el sof√†,en la moqueta..... Vaci√® medio bote de rexona y ni con esas. 
El ba√±o, precioso, por cierto, ten√¨a los cercos pegajosos de botes de champ√π o cremas... sobre la encimera negra, como si no hubieran limpiado.
Lamentable para un 5 estrellas.

He estado recientemente en otro NH en el extranjero, menos lujoso, y la experiencia ha sido de 10.

La habitaci√≥n individual es bastante amplia, muy moderna y bonita, buena ducha, y en general todo limpio... Y el desayuno con mucha variedad y buena calidad. 

Pero no todo es bueno, yo en un hotel de 5* podr√≠a esperar, qu√© menos, que una botella de agua peque√±a gratis. Aun siendo una habitaci√≥n individual, la cama podr√≠a ser de matrimonio, en vez de dos individuales, y sobre todo que no chirriasen tanto cuando nada m√°s te sientas en ella (no entiendo que este hotel tenga estas camas tan malas o ruidosas). Tambi√©n en los servicios del hotel dice que tiene gimnasio, spa, etc... S√≠ y no, no s√© si el gimnasio ser√° del hotel, pero que tengas que pagar 12‚Ç¨ por d√≠a... Mi gimnasio me cuesta 25‚Ç¨ un mes... Si no anunciara que tiene gimnasio o √©ste fuera m√°s barato (o gratis) y no tuviese esas camas... Le dar√≠a mayor puntuaci√≥n, pero para ser un 5*...tiene deficiencias. ",3,2018,03,08
30,Restaurante Bouquet,"Atenci√≥n excepcional por parte de Jordi/Julio!!! Muchas gracias por hacer tan grata nuestra estancia en el restaurante. Platos perfectamente presentados y de gran calidad. Muy bien atendidas. Sin duda, volveremos.
",5,2018,03,04
30,Le sobran estrellas ,"Hotel en el que se nota la desmotivaci√≥n del personal por la raz√≥n que sea. Habitaci√≥n sucia. Lo peor que te puede pasar en un sitio donde vas a dormir. Todav√≠a no me ha quedado muy claro lo del parking. Deber√≠an hac√©rselo ver. Llegamos de noche y nadie nos ofreci√≥ la posibilidad del desayuno. Error. Cuando llegas de viaje y tarde, es posible que aceptes un servicio que no ten√≠as contratado. Me pareci√≥ sorprendente que teniendo mi reserva duplicada en booking con un minuto de diferencia y con los mismos hu√©spedes, en recepci√≥n me dijeran que probablemente tuviera que pagar doble. En ese momento pens√© que se me caer√≠a la primera de las cinco estrellas de este hotel encima. No se ofreci√≥ nadie a ayudarnos con las maletas y la recepci√≥n est√° siempre vac√≠a hasta que buscas a alguien en el backoficce. Personalmente, no me ha gustado nada. Mucho tienen que cambiar si quieren seguir publicit√°ndose como un cinco estrellas. ",1,2018,03,04
30,Muy bueno,"Se pasa muy bien , est√° bien ubicado, desayuno muy bueno, la atenci√≥n es perfecta sobre en la recepci√≥n , te atienden bien y sobre todo cuando est√°s perdido por  no eres de all√≠, en sentido general los,precios son bastante m√≥dicos teniendo en cuenta q todo es caro en el mundo del turismo.",4,2018,02,24
30,Excelentes instalaciones pero ubicaci√≥n mejorable,"Excelentes instalaciones y trato.La habitaci√≥n y las vistas espectaculares. La ubicaci√≥n no es √≥ptima a menos que viajes por negocios. Pocos servicios alrededor, no hay buenos restaurantes ni atracciones, por tanto el taxi se hace indispensable.",4,2018,02,19
30,Bonito.  Pero..,"Me hosped√© en el hotel por 4 d√≠as, a mi arribo un check in flu√≠do, arquitectura impresionante, moderno.  Las habitaciones c√≥modas.... los espejos dan una sensaci√≥n de amplitud, me  desorient√© un poco con ello. Me toc√≥ d√≠a de Champions en el que jugaba el Real Madrid (vs. PSG).... en las habitaciones no entra el canal del partido y este solo se puede ver en el bar del lobby (Axis)..... pero verlo SIN SONIDO!!!!!!, en un √∫nico TV.   Para colmo, para cenar hay que irse hacia las mesas del fondo porque no nos pudimos hacer frente al TV.    Realmente me molestaron, eso que no ten√≠a mayores pasiones alrededor del juego.  Algunos Espa√±oles Madrilistas presentes estaban realmente molestos.   El TV queda enfrente de la entrada al lobby y cada que la puerta se abr√≠a entraba un chorro de viento polar..... y es el √∫nico sitio para ver el partido en todo este hotel!!!! 5 estrellas.  
Una paella aceptable, porci√≥n generosa all√≠ mismo en dicho bar.  Los ambientes son s√∫per tranquilos, el vecindario solo, seguro, silencioso, no hay nada que hacer en los alrededores pero se puede uno movilizar f√°cilmente. 
No hice uso de ning√∫n servicio aparte de la zona de auditorios que queda en el sotano y que son bastante c√≥modos.  El Gym al que se puede acceder por 13‚Ç¨ es muy moderno, bien dotado.  Cerca hay algunas panader√≠as y caf√©s (400 m) donde se puede ir a desayunar por mucho menos de lo que cuesta en el hotel (5‚Ç¨), sin embargo se puede preferir la comodidad de desayunar aqu√≠ (25‚Ç¨), depende de cada quien.  Muy cercanas las estaciones de Bellvitge y la del hospital, en este √∫ltimo se puede tomar el bus al Prat.  Recomendado. ",4,2018,02,17

30,muy bueno,"Estuvimos alojados por trabajo. El hotel es muy completo y con unas muy buenas instalaciones y muy cuidadas, solo indicar que seg√∫n su web dispone de gimnasio, aunque en realidad se trata de un gimnasio que esta muy cerca con el que tienen un acuerdo, pero tengo que reconocer que el gimnasio es muy completo. El personal muy agradable y profesional. Las habitaciones muy c√≥modas, confortables y limpias. Las vista desde los pisos altos son espectaculares.",4,2018,02,06
30,Genial,"Muy buena eleccion, hotel con instalaciones inmejorable, trato s√∫per correcto, amables.

30,AUDIO VISUALES,"La pantalla en las salas de reuniones no ten√≠an luz suficiente para que se vieran con nitidez. Los t√©cnicos de audio visuales dec√≠an que era por las dimensiones de la sala, pero es inc√≥modo no ver con suficiente luz determinadas √°reas de la pantalla en las presentaciones, m√°s cuando est√°bamos 8h diarias viendo diapositivas.",4,2018,01,31
30,Magn√≠fico hotel ,"Gran hotel que emos ido varias veces, nos gusta sobre todo la amplitud y las vistas de las habitaciones, s√∫per confortables y silenciosas. El desayuno de los m√°s completos que e visto y provado, con un personal muy profesional",5,2018,01,30
30,Gutes & sch√∂nes Hotel,"Hotel liegt nah am Flughafen und hat einen Hoteleigenen Shuttleservice. Die Mitarbeiter arbeiten alle h√∂chst professionell und sind sehr hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war gro√üz√ºgig und gut eingerichtet. Der Ausblick aus dem Zimmer war gut - aus der Tower-Bar im 29. Stock mit Rundumblick √ºber Barcelona grandios. Die Restaurants im Hotel sind sehr zu empfehlen und bei der Qualit√§t und dem Service recht g√ºnstig. In Summe eine Empfehlung mit einer kleinen Einschr√§nkung, dass man rund 15 Minuten vom Stadtzentrum entfernt ist. ",5,2018,01,27

30,Trabajo,Gran ubicaci√≥n a escasos metros del hospital . Gran cena en su restaurante. Personal algo exigente pero amable  de la cena llam√≥ la atenci√≥n el jam√≥n y el surtido de resecados as√≠ como el pastel de carne,4,2018,01,19

30,Lo que se puede esperar,"Un hotel con las comodidades propias de su categor√≠a. 
Estuve alojado all√≠ por un congreso y las facilidades son m√°ximas. 
El desayuno es muy completo, las habitaciones super espaciosas y no tuve problemas de ruido por la noche. 
Recomendable",5,2018,01,17
30,CORRECTO,"El trato del personal fue excelente y el precio que tuvimos de la habitaci√≥n muy bueno, tirando a excelente. Pero, por ser un hotel de tanta categoria, creo que le falta un poco  m√°s de calidad. El dise√±o del hotel esta muy bien, pero a mi gusto, las habitaciones estan ya un poco pasadas. La situaci√≥n tampoco es muy optima para ir a Barcelona, aunque dispones de una boca de metro practicamente enfrente del hotel y eso hace que sea f√°cil desplazarte al centro de la ciudad en 30 minutos. En resumen, el hotel esta muy muy bien, pero me esperaba un poquito m√°s",3,2018,01,15
30,Escapada pareja,"Muy buena experiencia.
Tarde en el spa, buena cena acompa√±ada de un gran vino recomendado por el somelier Cristian y para acabar una copa servida por la amable bartender Maria en el Dome con unas vistas espectaculares y un ambiente tranquilo. 
Un trato exquisito de todo el personal.
Mi reserva de habitaci√≥n tenia incluida una botella de cava que trajeron acompa√±ana de unas fresas con chocolate espectaculares.
Antes de irnos hemos pasado a hacer una visita al Tower club exclusivo para clientes a tomar un vermouth y un snack. 
Muy recomendable todo.

30,Location di lusso,"Ho soggiornato per quattro notti durante un viaggio acquistato sul web in promozione.
L'albergo √® lussuoso e confortevole e dotato di una vista mozzafiato sulla citt√†.
Molto buona la prima colazione e i servizi extra.
Non ho dato il massimo dei voti per due motivi: assenza del bid√® nonostante avessi una camera superior con un ottimo e spazioso bagno e per la lontananza dal centro citt√†, circa 20 minuti di metropolitana che pur essendo di fronte all'hotel alla lunga penalizza la vacanza, infatti direi che si tratta di una sistemazione pi√π adatta al business, vista anche la vicinanza all'aeroporto.",4,2018,01,08

30,Muy bien en general,Estuve s√≥lo una noche. Y bastante bien. Solo una pega: el sistema de llamar a los ascensores no funciona muy bien. Es un poco l√≠o. Deber√≠a haber algun panel en cada planta sencillo para explicar de c√≥mo funciona. ,4,2017,12,19

L'auditorium √® molto grande e adeguato ad una conferenza con molti utenti, noi eravamo circa 120 ed almeno met√† dei posti disponibili era vuota. Le stanze sono un po' vecchiotte, ma ampie e pulite, purtroppo entrando si sente un forte odore proveniente dal bagno (tubi). La colazione √® a buffet ma non √® molto ricca, durante gli spuntini ed il pranzo hanno portato tanta roba, parecchia in termini di quantit√† ma poca variet√†, la qualit√† del cibo in compenso non era male.

El personal es muy muy amable y eficiente.
El hotel est√° un poco apartado, genial para quienes acuden al hospital de Bellvitge o al oncol√≥gico, pero alejado para el resto, aunque lo cierto es que hay autobuses y metro cerca, en 30 minutos ( o un poco menos) est√° uno en plena plaza de Catalu√±a.por 2, 30‚Ç¨ en bus...y lo mismo al aeropuerto..10 minutos y esta uno ahi, genial...

30,p√©simo trato con el cliente,"El hotel es excelente. No obstante, con nosotros han tenido un comportamiento p√©simo por una actitud poco profesional cuando pedimos una camisa que nos olvidamos en la habitaci√≥n y consideraron que al no haber recibido ninguna comunicaci√≥n por su personal de ello, era nuestra palabra contra la de aquellos. No lo entiendo. no tengo pruebas de haber dejado la camisa en la habitaci√≥n. Pero as√≠ no se trata a un cliente. Pido que entreguen el valor de la camisa a una ONG o asociaci√≥n de caridad. No vuelvo m√°s a un hotel de NH. Saludos. Joaquin Collado",1,2017,10,21
30,Excelente hotel ejecutivo,"Habitaci√≥n excelente, muy amplia y confortable, con excelente vista. Desayuno bueno, atenci√≥n del personal excepcional. Parking disponible con acceso directo a las habitaciones, pago a parte. Internet de buena velocidad.",5,2017,10,20
30,FANTASTICO HOTEL CON PERSONAL MARAVILLOSO Y FUERA DE SERIE,"En nuestro caso, la visita fue debida a una operaci√≥n de mi hija y debo decir que lo mejor de todo fue la atenci√≥n del personal en todas sus dependencias y estamentos, siempre pensando en como satisfacernos debido a las circunstancias.
Alberto Falseta (Director de Operaciones) fue el primero que se intereso por nuestras circunstancias y puso al corriente a su personal. Elena, (Gobernanta), es una persona maravillosa, siempre atenta a cualquier necesidad y a llevar siempre detalles a mi hija, no falt√°ndole ning√∫n d√≠a unas flores en la habitaci√≥n, que siempre se encontraba limpia y ordenada.
Debido a que √≠bamos a estar bastantes d√≠as y las circunstancias de mi hija, nos asignaron una habitaci√≥n en el piso 24, con lo que las vistas eran especiales y el servicio de habitaciones siempre a punto.
La recepci√≥n del hotel, siempre atenta y a punto, para ponernos al momento una silla de ruedas con la que pod√≠amos mover a mi hija y bajar al restaurante cuando las circunstancias ya se lo permit√≠an. Roger y Eric siempre al tanto de lo que necesit√°ramos.
El restaurante AZIMUT, adecuado para el desayuno, bastante completo y donde Joan, Carlos y Maite te hacen disfrutar de un inicio del d√≠a agradable y atento a cualquier necesidad que te pueda apetecer.
El servicio y los platos que preparan en el restaurante BOUQUET  son muy bien elaborados y presentados.
El hotel esta ligeramente retirado del centro de Barcelona, pero ello le da varias ventajas.
Tiene servicio shuttle que conecta con el aeropuerto en 10 minutos y con el centro.
Tiene enfrente del hotel la parada del metro de la l√≠nea 1 que te conecta (sin trasbordos) con la Plaza de Catalu√±a.
Esta en un lugar muy tranquilo lo que permite descansar sin ruidos, adem√°s de que el hotel es muy tranquilo. En la parte trasera hay un peque√±o parque que te permite descansar y que a su vez evita casas pr√≥ximas que puedan producir ruido. Ello unido a la altura de las plantas pues tiene 29 plantas.
Resumiendo:
Desayuno excelente con zumo de naranja natural y variado apto para todos los gustos.
Restaurante BOUQUET bueno, variado y buena presentaci√≥n de los platos 
Recepci√≥n siempre atenta y muy eficiente( pedir planta alta) para tener vistas de la ciudad excelentes.
Habitaciones limpias ordenadas y con excelentes vistas.
Bien comunicado con el centro de Barcelona.
Posibilidad de Piscina y SPA.
Excelente Pub los fines de semana en el piso 29.
Pero sobre todo, sobre todo, la atenci√≥n del personal que se desvive por atenderte y tenerte siempre satisfecho. He destacado algunos nombres de los que me acuerdo porque el trato ha sido mas estrecho ( sobre todo con Elena y Roger), pero debo indicar que con todo el personal contactado ha sido y actuado de manera excepcional y lo digo con conocimiento de una persona que ha viajado por todo el mundo, tanto por mis labores profesionales como de turismo.

Das Personal ist freundlich beim Empfang und Check-In war fr√ºher m√∂glich.

Die Zimmer sind ok, allerdings teilweise nicht ganz sauber in den Ecken und das Mobiliar zeigte starke Gebrauchsspuren. 

Die Bedienung an der Bar war nicht ganz aufmerksam und es hat l√§nger gedauert (es war nicht voll).

30,Five stars?,"Le camere possono definirsi accettabili, gli appartamenti non sono neanche da 4 stelle secondo me. Il personale si fa in 4 come √® giusto che sia in hotel di questo tipo. Il bar a piano terra √® da evitare assolutamente se avete fretta! voto 6--",3,2017,08,26
30,aniversario de bodas,"hotel muy bonito y con bellas vistas.
a destacar la atenci√≥n del personal del restaurante.
la habitaci√≥n duplex confortable pero una renovaci√≥n de algunos muebles no les ir√≠a nada mal.
hab√≠a un escal√≥n en mal estado, la moqueta ya bastante pisada y algunos detalles m√°s que deber√≠an de ser arreglados por el precio que se paga  por noche.
por los dem√°s hemos disfrutado mucho.

30,Excepcional a precio asequible ,"Estuvimos 4 dias en julio por trabajo y nos encant√≥ el hotel. 
Adem√°s de notarse que es un hotel nuevo y con mucho estilo, la habitaci√≥n es muy grande y con todo tipo de comodidades: cama king size, sof√°, ducha con hidromasaje.... 
El buffet era muy completo y acorde a un hotel de esta categor√≠a. 
La √∫nica pega que pondr√≠a es que el hotel no dispone de gimnasio en sus instalaciones del hotel sino que tiene acceso a un Metropolitan que est√° justo al lado y por el que se cobra una tarifa de 12 ‚Ç¨ diarios. 
Por lo dem√°s, repetir√≠a mil veces. ",5,2017,08,14

Desayuno bueno y variado.
La piscina no estsba incluida en la tarifa normal del hotel.",4,2017,07,27
30,Buen Hotel,"Muy buena atenci√≥n, muy buenas vistas y bien comunicado. Son pocos los detalles a mejorar ,para una estad√≠a de pocos d√≠as esta bien. El Bufet es muy variado. No hay peine y pasta de dientes. El jamon nos dijieron q era cortado pero no lo era. Pero est√° bien.",5,2017,07,27

Habitaci√≥n muy espaciosa repartida en dos estancias, abajo una sala de estar con servicio y arriba la zona de cama, vestidor, ba√±o y jacuzzi con buenas vistas. La habitaci√≥n no es nada ruidosa, tuvimos la sensaci√≥n de estar solos en el edificio en todo momento. Las camas son amplias y comodas.",5,2017,07,25
30,Buen servicio.,"Prever la contingencia de que un cliente llegue en un vuelo nocturno -muy retrasado- y que llegue a medianoche. Por la ubicaci√≥n del hotel no se puede encontrar nada abierto por las inmediaciones a ciertas horas. En mi caso no fue un desplazamiento por ocio o placer, fue por una intervenci√≥n ambulatoria de oftalmolog√≠a en el Hospital de Belvitge, ubicado junto al hotel. Nos enteramos de la existencia de un servicio de shuttle al aeropuerto  por casualidad, falt√≥ esa informaci√≥n al hacer el chek-in.",4,2017,07,20

30,Mejor opci√≥n cerca del aeropuerto de El Prat y de la Fira Barcelona,"Como viajero muy frecuente, me gusta tener buenas opciones de alojamiento cerca de los aeropuertos. El Hesperia Tower (NH Collection Barcelona Tower) es el mejor ejemplo de un hotel 5 estrellas cercano al aeropuerto y lleno de servicios a un precio razonable. Habitaciones espaciosas y muy c√≥modas. Con todos los servicios que uno espera de un hotel de esa categor√≠a. 
El personal de servicio, excepcional. Todos son destacables en sus responsabilidades. Su buen humor y disposici√≥n para servir al hu√©sped exceden las expectativas 
F√°cil de llegar a la ciudad y al aeropuerto gracias al transporte gratuito ofrecido por el hotel. 
Volver√©!",5,2017,07,20
30,Buen Hotel,"El Hotel es muy c√≥modo, sin embargo la direccion que se encuentra en la pagina web no es real, ya que no se encuentra en la gran v√≠a y esta bastante apartado de Barcelona, ya que ni siquiera esta dentro. Obviamente esta informacion no la conociamos y fue un poco decepcionante al llegar y enterarte de esto, creo que deber√≠an hacer mas hincapi√© en la ubicaci√≥n de este Hotel, ya que la mayor√±ia de los viajeros desconocemos el movimiento y distancias de cada ciudad que visitamos. 

En general el Hotel esta muy bien, buen servicio, en especial quiero reconocer el que hayan respetado mi solicitud antes de mi llegada, ya que avise que llegaria temprano y que necesitaba 2 habitaciones cercanas con diferentes tipos de camas, las cuales ya estaban justo como las solicite a mi llegada. La limpieza es muy Buena y las vistas desde la habitacion son espectaculares por la noche. 

Muchas gracias por el servicio del shuttle complementario del Hotel a las Ramblas, en definitiva esta fue la razon por las que les doy un 4, ya que en cierta manera compenzan el estar tan lejos de la ciudad de Barcelona. Mi unica recomendacion es que deber√≠a haber un ultimo servicio un poco mas tarde, ya que el Turibus termina el recorrido cerca de las 8pm y a esta hora ya uno tiene que buscar como vovler y en taxi son cerca de 20‚Ç¨. ",4,2017,07,19
30,Hotel de ensue√±o,Es el mejor hotel de Barcelona con diferencia. Las mejores vistas de la ciudad con unas instalaciones nuevas y una habitaci√≥n con jacuzzi de m√°ximo lujo.

30,Gran hotel,"Un hotel magn√≠fico, buen servicio a la habitaci√≥n, un desayuno fabuloso aunque el precio es algo elevado pero vale la pena. Muy buena limpieza y gran amabilidad del personal del hotel. La √∫nica ""pega"" es que las ventanas no pueden abrirse.

30,UNA TOWER PARA SO√ëAR Y DESCANSAR,"La Tower es una aut√©ntica maravilla. Pasamos un fin de semana perfecto. Empezamos comiendo en el Restaurante del hotel...y fue una delicia de servicio y calidad. Gracias Edwin!!!!! El cocinero es un genio de la gastronom√≠a. El precio del Restaurante no es caro comparado con la calidad de la comida y del servicio de mesa....est√° sobre los 40‚Ç¨ tomando cava o vino. Los calamarcitos con arroz negro chapeau!!!! El hotel es precioso, amplio, lleno de luz y muy confortable. El precio no es caro...teniendo en cuenta que es un 5 estrellas. El Room Service es perfecto...y m√°s cuando la cocina te env√≠a un cava fresquito para aguantar la noche. En definitva, es un Hotel muy recomendable para pasar unos d√≠as....calidad, buen servicio y atenci√≥n al cliente. Seguro que volver√©. Gracias Tower!!!!!",4,2017,07,10
30,Buono per una notte,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per una notte e devo dire che non √® male.
 Vicino all'aeroporto di BCN e con  servizio shuttle gratis ( controllare gli orari ); suggerisco di  essere alla fermata un po' prima dell'orario di partenza dato che la disponibilit√† dei posti nel pulmino √® limitata. Camere ottime e pulite. Colazione ok. Prezzo un po' sopra la media....ma li vale tutti. Personale troppo giovane e inesperto ( motivo per il quale non do le 5 stelle) che stona parecchio in una struttura simile; gli apprendisti dovrebbero sempre essere affiancati da persone senior.In sintesi....buono. Ci ritorner√≤.",4,2017,07,07
30,Hotel moderno acorde a las 5 estrellas,"Hotel muy bueno, decoraci√≥n muy moderna aunque el hotel ya tiene alg√∫n a√±ito, en su d√≠a ser√≠a muy rompedor, servicio recepci√≥n correcto, habitaci√≥n muy confortable, con todos los detalles, el √∫nico pero es que cenar en la cafeter√≠a es realmente caro, hamburguesa 19 euros, el desayuno s√∫per completo y bueno",4,2017,07,05
30,"Bell'hotel, location da dimenticare","L'hotel e' molto bello, le camere sono spaziose e ben pulite. E' vicino all'aeroporto ma distante dal centro storico, nel senso che senza auto o taxi e' difficile arrivarci. Il prezzo convenzionato con l'azienda non lo definirei propriamente economico, ma va anche detto che il buffet colazione e' ampiamente soddisfacente",3,2017,06,30
30,Faltas en el aseo,"El desayuno lo considero en mi opinion corto con poca variedad para ser un hotel de 5 estrellas,no hab√≠a en el cuarto de ba√±o zapatillas,peine, pasta de dientes,maquinilla de afeitar ni para limpiar zapatos",3,2017,06,29
30,Designer-Hotel mit M√§ngel,"Wir waren Mitte Juni hier. Man gab uns das Zimmer 1603. Hier fanden wir gro√üfl√§chig Schimmel an der Duschdecke vor und baten um ein anderes Zimmer. Man gab uns das Zimmer 1702. Hier stank es nach Urin und so stark nach Schimmel, dass es einem im Mund bitter wurde.

Ansonsten war das Fr√ºhst√ºck sehr gut und das Personal professionell. Preis war f√ºr Barcelona ok.

Liegt au√üerhalb der Innenstadt. Man hat mehr Ruhe, zugleich muss man eine Strecke von ca 25-30 Minuten mit der U-Bahn zur√ºcklegen.

WLAN-Daten musste man des √ñfteren eingeben.",3,2017,06,28
30,Hotel espectacular,"Este hotel fue una sorpresa por parte de mi pareja, el a√±o pasado.
Un regalo que uno no olvida f√°cilmente.
Nos ubicaron en la planta 15 con unas vistas espectaculares de BCN. Casi todo el piso de la habitaci√≥n con moqueta, una sala de estar que parece la de tu casa, tv plana, muebles, l√°mpara, vamos que es un sal√≥n. Al lado entras ya a lo que es la habitaci√≥n, bien, grande pero sencilla, sin recargar.
Luego entras al lavabo y es enorme; dos picas, ducha con mampara perfecta para ""jugar"", un lavado de pel√≠cula. 
Pero lo mejor fue su desayuno: hab√≠a de todo y de calidad, jam√≥n del bueno, pastas de calidad, no industrial. Leche de todas clases, sin lactosa, de avena, semi etc... 
Un servidor ha estado en muchos hoteles y algunos bastante buenos, pero nunca he visto un desayuno tan bueno, variado y de calidad.",5,2017,06,28
30,Bellissima struttura peccato per la posizione ,"Ottima struttura, camere lussuose e confortevoli, squisito il personale eccellente la colazione. 
Peccato per l'ubicazione, ma fortunatamente vicinissima la fermata della metro. Abbiamo fatto un pochino di fatica a trovarlo perch√© la facciata non riporta ancora il logo Nh.",4,2017,06,24
30,El para√≠so de los hoteles,"Sin exagerar, este hotel me pareci√≥ de lo m√°s agradable.. tanto la ambientaci√≥n, el dise√±o del lobby las habitaciones, los pasillos, y la atenci√≥n de cada una de las personas que nos atendieron, en el bar del lobby, en la recepci√≥n, en el spa, los mozos del sal√≥n de desayuno (solo recuerdo el nombre de Javier) de la gente de limpieza.. todo nos pareci√≥ impecable, reglas claras y excelente informaci√≥n. 
Pero adem√°s, quiero darle un particular agradecimiento a la atencion y calidad del servicio que nos brindaron en el restaurante Bouquet. Pedimos vino, una entrada de ib√©rico riqu√≠sima.. y luego paella  , la porci√≥n fue muy abundante y exquisita. Entre tanto nos entretuvieron haci√©ndonos degustar aceites de oliva, sales y aceitunas.. un encanto..  gracias ",5,2017,06,19
30,Sra Gladys Patricia Jaramillo,"
Doy Gladys Jaramillo 
Es un hotel que no tiene ning√∫n tipo de seguridad para los hu√©spedes   Fuimos con la familia (12 personas) el d√≠a 25 de Mayo de 2017.  Al momento de registrarnos y presentar el pasaporte en la recepci√≥n  le robaron la cartera con el iPhone, iPad, dinero, etc  a uno de nosotros. Sin que nadie de nosotros nos percataramos que all√≠ adentro estaban 2 delincuentes Esto sucedi√≥ en 3 minutos.  
El hotel no se hizo responsable de nada y por el contrario nos mandaron hacer una denuncia y perdimos mucho tiempo de nuestro viaje de turismo.  Finalmente cumplido todo el proceso del reclamo, su respuesta fue que el hotel no se responsabiliza de los  robos en las √°reas comunes y que en el video vieron que alguien ingreso a robar  y sali√≥ enseguida . 
No recomiendo llegar a este hotel,   Al d√≠a siguiente nos enteramos que robaron una maleta a otro hu√©sped 
Es incre√≠ble , no tienen ning√∫n tipo de seguridad y no entiendo c√≥mo es posible que estando dentro del hotel ellos no se responsabilicen .

30,"Lujo, calidad, modernismo y comodidad","El t√≠tulo lo resume todo. El hotel es espectacular. El edificio es, arquitect√≥nicamente impresionante y es muy moderno y original. Una pasada que recomiendo visitar a cualquiera. La habitaci√≥n era perfecta: moderna, comida, limpia y con unas vistas espectaculares. El personal de recepci√≥n es muy atento al igual que el servicio en el restaurante para el desayuno. Uno de los camareros record√≥ que ped√≠ un capuchino y me lo trajo el segundo d√≠a sin que yo lo pidiera. Eso es atenci√≥n. Felicidades porque volveremos SEGURO. ",5,2017,06,18
30,Ni una pega,"Muy buena experiencia.
Llegu√© tarde y me hicieron en check in muy r√°pidamente, con upgrade a habitaci√≥n superior. La habitaci√≥n estaba en el piso 25, eran dos plantas, con sal√≥n y jacuzzi al lado de la cama. El colch√≥n comod√≠simo, el ba√±o y las amenities genial y el servicio de habitaciones bastante r√°pido.
El desayuno tambi√©n muy completo. Por ponerle una pega, estaba cerrada la mitad del sal√≥n de desayunos y hab√≠a mucha gente (asistentes a un congreso), con lo que hab√≠a bastante barullo y mi mesa, que estaba junto a la zona de paso, la mov√≠an bastante al pasar. 
Lo recomendar√≠a sin dudar.",5,2017,06,12
30,EXCELENTE HOTEL,"Tanto el check-in como el check-out fueron r√°pidos y el trato dado por el personal fue excelente en todo momento.

Buenas instalaciones para los que les gusta el deporte.
Muy recomendable para los que van de viajes de negocios!!

30,Asombroso dise√±o en una localizaci√≥n intermedia,"El hotel tiene un dise√±o espectacular y est√° situado en una zona intemedia entre el aeropuerto y la ciudad, en el √°rea de la Fira. Los servicios de spa, gimnasio y piscina pertenecen al centro deportivo que est√° en el edificio anexo al hotel, con el que tienen acuerdos, pero estrictamente est√°n fuera del hotel.

Nos mejoraron la habitaci√≥n, d√°ndonos una suite, en lugar de la doble normal que hab√≠amos reservado, as√≠ que ten√≠amos sal√≥n, vestidor y un ba√±o con ducha de chorros y jacuzzi, adem√°s, al estar situados en la planta 13, las vistas eran espectaculares. 

En la recepci√≥n intentan ayudarte en lo que pueden y tienen a disposici√≥n de los clientes agua con lim√≥n, chuches y otras amenities.",5,2017,06,07

30,Recomendable,"El hotel tiene unas vistas espectaculares, las habitaciones est√°n bien. Nos alojamos en una suite y era muy amplia y con todos los servicios necesarios.

Prezzo del parcheggio 15 euro. 
Wifi gratuito.

Empezando por la llegada, nadie se ofreci√≥ a ayudarnos con el equipaje,tuvimos que esperar media hora para que nos atendieran en la recepci√≥n (lo entendemos porque era el fin de semana de la formula 1 y hab√≠a mucha gente). La habitaci√≥n tenia una importante falta de mantenimiento, el ba√±o no dispon√≠a de ning√∫n colgador para las toallas, el ambiente parec√≠a que estaba cargado de √°caros, el colchon y las almohadas no eran nada c√≥modos y la se√±al wifi no llegaba bien. El d√≠a de la salida lo comunicamos en recepci√≥n, tuvieron el detalle de no cobrarnos la bebida, los recepcionistas muy amables. Encuentro que el hotel, para estar al nivel que pretende estar, necesita un buen repaso en cuanto a mantenimiento, se empieza a ver antiguo y mal cuidado.

30,MUY BUEN HOTEL CON VISTAS MARAVILLOSAS.,"De los mejores que he estado √∫ltimamente, tiene unas habitaciones espectaculares, unas instalaciones inmejorables, y el desayuno de lo bueno lo mejor, no tengo duda que cuando vuelva a Barcelona me alojare en este hotel.",5,2017,04,27
30,Muy buen hotel con ligeros detalles a pulir,"En general el hotel es impresionante, lejos de lugares muy tur√≠sticos pero a 5 minutos de la parada del metro. Nos alojamos la semana del 17 al 23 en una de las suites duplex, la cual tiene un dise√±o moderno y poco convencional en su planta superior, con la ba√±era hidromasaje separada del resto del ba√±o que, por otro lado, permite disfrutar de las vistas mientras uno se relaja. Se aprecian ligeros desperfectos y detalles, al parecer, fruto del poco cuidado de otros clientes. Claramente la vista es mejor en una de las caras del hotel que en otra. A nosotros nos toc√≥ el lado que da al hospital de Bellvitge, que es algo peor dentro de lo impresionante. La limpieza bien, con algunos descuidos, por ejemplo en la reposici√≥n de tazas para la cafetera o hervidor. Buenos amenities, aunque algunos albornoces necesitan jubilarse.

    El personal muy correcto y amable, sobre todo Mayte, la cual nos sirvi√≥ atentamente en los desayunos. El √∫nico ""desliz"" se produjo justo cuando nos √≠bamos. Decidimos hacer el check-out y antes de partir tomar un caf√© en el Axis bar detr√°s de recepci√≥n. El caso es que era hora de cambio de turno y el caf√© fu√© abonado a la camarera saliente, d√°ndose la situaci√≥n de que el camarero entrante no sab√≠a de dicho abono. √âsto produjo que cuando nos √≠bamos un compa√±ero de dicho camarero se tuviera que ver en la tesitura de interceptarnos fuera del hotel para preguntarnos si los caf√©s estaban pagados, lo cual fue un poco vergonzante tanto para √©l como para nosotros. Por lo dem√°s, impecable tanto en recepci√≥n como en restaurantes.

   Menci√≥n destacada al Tower club, el cual desconoc√≠a completamente. Una estancia privada a la que pueden acceder los hu√©spedes de determinadas habitaciones. Un sitio ideal para relajarse escuchando m√∫sica y tomando algo. Tambi√©n tuvimos la suerte de que, siendo el 23 la celebraci√≥n de San Jordi, la c√∫pula superior estaba abierta al p√∫blico la noche del 22. Si se tiene opci√≥n, es de visita casi obligada. Es preciosa y con tremendas vistas.

    En res√∫men, un hotel excelente con peque√±os detalles f√°cilmente solucionables.",4,2017,04,25
30,nada especial,nadie ayud√≥ con el equipaje a la llegada en coche a la puerta. No es muy l√≥gico que nadie est√© en la puerta para ayudar con el equipaje siendo un hotel de 5 *. Una vez dentro y descargado y entrado el equipaje por nosotros mismos. Tampoco nadie atendi√≥ como m√≠nimo para ofrecernos ayuda para subirlo a la suite.,3,2017,04,25

30,"Ganz ok, aber sicher keine 5 Sterne ","Check-in und Check-out verliefen unkompliziert und problemlos. Das Zimmer war leider etwas abgewohnt, die Aussicht aus dem 21. Stock jedoch top. Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet war nett, jedoch w√§re es toll, wenn man auch (wie angegeben und somit erwartet) bis 11 fr√ºhst√ºcken k√∂nnte. Stattdessen wurde das Buffet um halb 11 geschlossen und um kurz vor 11 Licht und Musik abgedreht - obwohl wir noch da sa√üen. Service war leider nicht erkennbar...

30,staff muy hospitalario y acogedor,"Hace unos d√≠as, 5 compa√±eros y yo, pas√°bamos al rededor del hotel y quisimos curiosear un poco viendo la entrada principal.
Nos asomamos y enseguida vinieron a atendernos muy cort√©s y educadamente. Dijimos que est√°bamos estudiando turismo y que s√≥lo est√°bamos echando un vistazo pero enseguida nos atendieron muy gustosamente. Incluso un miembro del departamento de food and beverage, Javier, nos invit√≥ a ver las instalaciones del hotel. Fue una visita inesperada pero muy amena, nos encant√≥ las intalaciones. pudimos ver su famosa c√∫pula acristalada, una de sus suits, el auditorio, su restaurante...
Salimos del hotel encantados por el trato y por el ambiente que se respiraba. Sin duda un buen hotel a recomendar si desean hospedarse en Barcelona

Muchisimas gracias

Entgegen den letzten Bewertungen √ºber das Hotel muss ich sagen, dass wir mit Service, Freundlichkeit, Fr√ºhst√ºcksangebot, Sauberkeit und Zimmerausstattung sehr zufrieden waren.
Es gab sogar zum Geburtstag meiner Freundin eine kleine selbst gemachte Torte was sehr gut ankam.

Das Hotel selbst liegt zwar etwas von der Innenstadt entfernt, welche jedoch gut per Metro in ca. 20 Minuten Fahrzeit erreichbar ist. Kosten pro Fahrt schmale 2,40 EUR.

El desayuno esta muy acertado tanto en boller√≠a en donde destacar√≠a las ensaimadas, como con la variedad de embutidos, quesos, etc, tambi√©n hay comida caliente.

30,Lujo√ç,Me encanta este hotel porque es lujoso y muy acogedor. Las suites son muy amplias y las paredes del ba√±o de cristal le dan m√°s amplitud. El √∫nico fallo es la ubicaci√≥n si el viaje es de ocio y no de trabajo.,5,2017,03,03

El ba√±o de la habitaci√≥n muy amplio, con jacuzzi y ducha. Amenities, agua, y varios detalles que marcaban la diferencia. El lobby bar est√° bien para tomar copas tranquilos hasta la madrugada. La habitaci√≥n estaba en la planta 20 y ten√≠a muy buenas vistas. Plazas amplias de garaje. Personal de limpieza por todo el hotel durante todo el fin de semana, y todo el personal siempre recibiendo con una sonrisa. Especialmente agradecer a Sr Roger y Diego por su amabilidad en el check out y check in. As√≠ dan ganas de volver, repetiremos sin duda.",5,2017,02,28
30,Deficiente ,"Principalmente me molest√≥ la falta de delicadeza para con el descanso. Argumentando cosas sin sentido para llamar a la puerta antes de que hayas hecho el check out. Te bombardean desde las 8 de la ma√±ana haciendo ruido alrededor de la habitaci√≥n, ya sea la se√±orita de la limpieza, los del minibar y finalmente en recepci√≥n. Parte de mi tiempo de descanso lo perd√≠ hablando con cada uno de ellos y bajando a recepci√≥n porque a√∫n despu√©s de argumentarles que con una lista de check-out se puede evitar estas incidencias, siguieron haciendo ruidos. Realmente no es un hotel para descansar que es lo que yo necesitaba. Me ofrecieron sus disculpas pero hay palabras que est√°n vacias. Quer√≠an regalarme una tarjeta para el parking pero ya les dije que las disculpas eran suficientes, ni ellos tienen que arrastrase ni yo tampoco. Si pagas por un servicio ese el que tienes que obtener, ni m√°s ni menos. La amabilidad brilla por su ausencia, paga, no manches mucho y vete pronto y sino te aprieto para que te vayas. Penosamente es com√∫n a muchos hoteles. Y algunos clientes tambi√©n dejan que desear, pero este no es mi caso. Ya lo dije en recepci√≥n, yo no he venido aqu√≠ para esto, he venido a descansar y parece que soy vuestra jefa. De verdad, doy gracias de haber dejado el mundo del turismo despu√©s de haber hecho pr√°cticas en el Hotel NH Numancia y en la agencia Racc Viajes, en busca de algo que se adecuara m√°s a mis necesidades. No dej√©is que os echen de habitaciones que hab√©is pagado antes de tiempo y reclamad que se respete vuestro descanso, cayarse o hacer oidos sordos, no es forma de vivir, es una forma de consumirse. Por supuesto que dejen de llamar a tu puerta no es una soluci√≥n si siguen limpiando en las habitaciones contiguas a golpes o arrastrando las camas o las sillas para limpiar, de peque√±ito te ense√±an a levantar la silla y no arrastrar cosas por casa, es tan dificil, por favor. Tambi√©n hay que decir que la estructura es importante y si es defectuosa o vieja es m√°s propensa a generar ruido, esto hay que tenerlo encuenta para avisar de, esto me molesta, se puede arreglar, me puedes cambiar de habitaci√≥n, todo depende de la hora a la que suceda. Por ejemplo: Los aires acondicionados, extractores que en este caso se encend√≠an solos de repente cuando ya llevabas un rato en la habitaci√≥n sin haber tocado nada. Puesto que prefiero ponerme una manta que aguantar el ruido ambiente de un climatizador. Realmemte si se pone atenci√≥n y voluntad de mejorar las cosas se puede, las prisas son malas consejeras, ya me lo reconocieron en recepci√≥n aunque s√≥lo les dur√≥ un segundo, luego ya vieneron de nuevo las disculpas y las compensaciones excesivas, que por supuesto no acept√©. Con una disculpa sincera es suficiente, porque recibes disculpas pero o son excesivas o se kes nota en la cara y en los ojos que sentir no sienten nada. S√≥lo queria estar tranquila y eso es mucho pedir.Eso no tiene precio.",2,2017,02,25
30,Hotel impresionante,"Hemos estado el fin de semana en una suite junior maravillosa, muy espaciosa, con un jacuzzi increible, una cama enorme, nos facilitaron la cuna para la peque, realmente nos sentimos como en casa, las vistas espectaculares, el desayuno de reyes, los ascensores muy originales... el metro a 2 minutos por lo q fuimos a Bcna ciudad sin ningun problema a pasar el dia.... en fin todo genial, volveria sin ninguna duda",5,2017,02,21

La habitaci√≥n en la planta superior tiene un jacuzzi perfecto junto a un ventanal de pared a pared que hac√≠a que pudieras disfrutar de las vistas de Barcelona desde una planta 25. Realmente impresionante. 

El desayuno es muy completo y hay para todos los gustos. Lo que me sorprendi√≥ muy positivamente es que ten√≠an varias cosas que las hac√≠an a mano como diferentes mermeladas e incluso tienen una paradita en la que puedes escoger las frutas que m√°s te gusten y pedirle al camarero que te hiciera un batido, que la verdad es que estaba delicioso. 

Es un hotel en el que empezando por el personal, ya que es especialmente servicial y atento, y acabando por cada uno de los detalles pensados para el cliente,  hacen que tu experiencia sea mucho m√°s acogedora.

30,Bonita experiencia con pro y contra,"Hemos pasado el fin de a√±o, una bonita experiencia con sus pro y contra.
Habitaci√≥n - bastante bien, bonita vista ( de noche aun mejor), le dar√≠a 4 estrellas. A la columna de hidromasaje le faltaba un jet y el mueble tenia la tapa del maquillador rota. 
Mini bar para mi gusto un poco caro.
Restaurante - la cena de fin de a√±o fue celebrada en la zona Convention Center, pasamos un poco de fr√≠o, el servicio de los camareros 5 estrellas, comida normal, algunos platos muy buenos y otros no tanto( la ternera con trozos de cart√≠lago)
Me av√≠a gustado un poco de m√∫sica durante la cena  y a las 00:00 para las campanadas hab√≠a una tele solo para verla que el sonido no se escuchaba en toda la sala.
Fiesta - en la c√∫pula encima del hotel, vista y decoraci√≥n   guap√≠sima, con dj, solo que para mi gusto demasiada luz.
Recepci√≥n - buen trato, personal amable solo que un poco fresco.
Hemos pagado en efectivo la taza tur√≠stica y productos del mini bar y no lo han vuelto a cargar en la tarjeta de cr√©dito. Hemos llamado y en menos de 24h fue solucionado.
Para una estancia corta fue bastante bien. ",4,2017,01,06
30,Excelente relaci√≥n calidad precio,"Por un precio inmejorable para un 5* nos hemos alojado una noche en una habitaci√≥n sencilla. Ba√±o-vestidor muy amplio y c√≥modo, habitaci√≥n muy amplia, c√≥moda con sofa al lado de un gran ventanal que da mucha luz natural a la habitaci√≥n. Habitaci√≥n acogedora en general muy limpia, silenciosa, cama grande y c√≥moda y televisi√≥n grande a parte de minibar, cajafuerte...solo falto el cepillo de dientes de usar y tirar ya que me lo olvid√© y no os√© pedir.

El hotel esta perfectamente comunicado con una l√≠nea de metro a 2 minutos andando y diferentes l√≠neas de autobuses que te llevan al centro de la ciudad. No hay nada de interes alrededor excepto centros comerciales.

Parking un poco caro a mi parecer, 18 euros al dia el cual a simple vista est√° abierto. Servicio excelente y amable, sobretodo del personal del servicio de cena del restaurante, en el cual cenamos a la carta estupendamente y en ambiente y relaci√≥n calidad precio inmejorable.

El ambiente del hotel era estupendo, la zona de recepci√≥n-lobby decorada con gusto moderno, hilo m√∫sical adecuado en todo el hotel y con diferentes zonas de paseo, consumo y descanso.
A mejorar el desgaste del alg√∫n mueble y decoraci√≥n que aunque en buen estado no deja llegar a la excelencia.

El desayuno buffet estupendo, un gran surtido de frutas, dulces y comida salada,  al parecer no funcionaban las cafeteras aunque el personal nos proporciono cafe aunque no a mi  gusto.

No use los servicios de Spa
Sin duda repetiria, los precios y servicios que ofrecen son estupendos en comparaci√≥n al resto de hoteles de la zona o el centro de la ciudad, y la distancia es facilmente solventable con los medios de transporte que se disponen en la zona.",4,2017,01,02
30,Muy recomendable,"Quise darle una sorpresa a mi mujer y cogi una Junior suite, la habitaci√≥n de casi 60m posee un sal√≥n anexo y un gran ba√±o con vestidor, ducha y ba√±era gigante con jacuzzi, cama extra grande y preciosas vistas, adem√°s se nos proporcion√≥ una llave para subir a la 5 planta al tower club, donde se nos obsequiaba como en una zona vip de cualquier aeropuerto con bebidas y buffet ligero gratis.",5,2016,12,30

30,Cena de Empresa,"La calidad de la comida excepcional, el trato inmejorable, las habitaciones acogedoras, la ubicaci√≥n es lo que menos me gusta, pero est√° cerca del transporte publico. En conclusi√≥n, para m√≠ y mis compa√±eros excelente",5,2016,12,22
30,Sigue a buen nivel pero...,"El hotel, sigue con una atenci√≥n muy buena, y la calidad en las comidas excelente. 

En esta ocasi√≥n nos hospedamos en una Junior Suite Duplex, la habitaci√≥n es magn√≠fica y tiene una vistas preciosas por la noche, menci√≥n extra por la ba√±era de hidromasaje.

No obstante al hotel le hace falta un repaso de mantenimiento considerable. Muchas ralladuras y maderas tocadas. Los ascensores hac√≠an muy mal olor los dos d√≠as. Puertas otras, duchas tocadas... cal...

Seguro que solucionaran estos peque√±os inconvenientes y volver√° a ser uno de los mejores hoteles de Barcelona.

Igualmente se mantiene como el mejor hotel calidad/precio con diferencia!",4,2016,12,18

30,Nur spanische 5*,"Service war klasse, 5 sprachig an der Rezeption. Das Essen war auch lecker... leider hat der Kaffee gar nicht geschmeckt :( 
An sich ein klasse Hotel, aber nicht vergleichbar mit deutschen 4* Hotels. Doof war dass es keine frische Luft in den R√§umen gab, nur Klimaanlage. Leider nicht so gut wenn man Asthma oder anderweitige Probleme hat.

No s√© qu√© tal el desayuno, pq 23‚Ç¨ por persona lo encuentro muy elevado, nunca desayuno en hotel si es superior a 12‚Ç¨ por persona (que ya lo encuentro elevado trat√°ndose de desayuno).

30,De alto nivel ,"La verdad es que el hotel est√° perfecto para una estancia de trabajo o ir con tu pareja toda la habitaci√≥n est√° muy bien decorado y las vistas son incre√≠bles. 
Lo malo el precio no lo suelen bajar.
Y aparte la zona para comer o cenar no ofrece apenas posibilidades por lo cual si no vas en coche para cenar sobre todo o kebad o ha cenar en el hotel.
El metro eso s√≠ lo tienes en frente y los taxis tambi√©n.  Todo depende del presupuesto ",4,2016,11,21

Las √∫nicas pegas que le ponemos son una que nos pone en caracter√≠sticas de la habitaci√≥n que est√° insonorizada y no he ido a un hotel con peor insonorizaci√≥n en mi vida, escuchaba a la pareja de al lado hablar y otras cosas, y las de la otra habitaci√≥n ver la tele.

30,Geschmackvolles Hotel in Flughafenn√§he.,"Sehr geschmackvoll eingerichteteZimmer, nicht so steril wie in vielen Hotels.

Hervorragende Ausstattung uns Annehmlichkeiten (z.B. 3 dicke Badem√§ntel in einem Einzelzimmer, Multifunktionsdusche usw.)

Personal verdient besonderes Lob, sehr aufmerksam und freundlich.

Bur 10-15 min vom Flughafen entfernt, daf√ºr aber erwas weit zum Zentrum.

Die Aufzugsteuerung ist bei gro√üem Andrand allerdings grausam: zur Fr√ºhst√ºcks rush hour ben√∂tigte ich 12 min vom 21. in den 4. Stock.

Ein Kritikpunkt: Sauberkeit im Badezimmer d√ºrfte besser sein, in einem Haus dieser Qualit√§t muss auch auf Kleinigkeiten geachtet werden.",4,2016,11,08

30,Ottimo hotel,"Ottimo hotel, con un rapporto prezzo servizi pi√π che accettabile, era una junior suite da circa 50 mq complessivi, al 24 piano con una vista spettacolare.

Colazione pi√π che abbondante, mista sia mediterranea che continentale, personale gentile, affabile, attento ad intervenire se per caso ti trovi in difficolt√†,,,, All'inizio per spostarci al centro abbiamo usato il taxi, sempre disponibili fuori dall'hotel: presa dimistichezza con la zona, a circa 100 massimo 150 metri c'√® una fermata della metropolitana, e finalmente abbiamo usato la tessera dei trasporti, prenotata via internet e che si pu√≤ ritirare sia in aeroporto che in piazza Catalunya. Non essendo mai stati a Barcellona, abbiamo sempre preferito pranzare e cenare fuori hotel, quindi non posso recensire la cucina,,,,, Concludendo, solo da consigliare vivamente, di sicuro sar√† sempre il nostro punto di appoggio quando riandremmo a Barcellona.",5,2016,11,01

30,Una noche,Francamente es un hotel muy bueno limpio y todo el personal excelente. Es cierto que tomarte un vino en el Bar un  crianza te cuesta 6‚Ç¨ es descabellado y desproporcionado esos detalles habr√≠a que mirar as√≠ como el olor cuando entras a la habitaci√≥n.

Dejamos en toda nuestra estancia el coche en el parking y decidimos movernos con el metro por la ciudad ya que hay una parada de la L1 muy cerca y fue un gran acierto viendo la gran circulaci√≥n que hay los d√≠as laborables.

30,5 estrellas?? Hace tiempo que no‚Ä¶ ,"Fin de semana en Barcelona. Buen tiempo y la mejor compa√±ia. Reservamos en este pedazo de hotel de 5 estrellas aprovechando un precio razonable por estar algo retirado del centro. Pero si lo se no vengo. Aceptamos voluntariamente la incomodidad de estar lejos del centro, pero por lo que no pasamos es por que el trato sea de hostal! 
La conexion wifi gratuita‚Ä¶  normal, no funciona! El mobiliario roto, el check in a las 3 de la tarde... Y lo que mas me ha molestado del mundo es que llamas al room service para pedirles hielo para tomarte un gin tonic fresquito (que ya de por si en el mini bar,  entre el gin y la tonica me va a costar como en un club nocturno del centro)  van y te dicen que el hielo es gratis, pero que te lo traigan a la habitacion son 5‚Ç¨!! 
Lo siento, pero la proxima vez que venga a bcn un fin de semana me gasto 100‚Ç¨ mas por un 5 estrellas de verdad en el centro y me saldra mas barato. Entre los que cobran por el parking, los taxis, el servicio de habitaciones‚Ä¶  esto es un enga√±abobos. 
Este hotel cuando inauguro era de lo mejor de bcn, ahora una casta√±a.

30,Cinco estrellas trato de tres,"Mal servicio para un cinco estrellas y fuera de lo normal en un hotel NH, la verdad a pesar de ser del grupo hay gran diferencia de los NH de verdad a los Hesperia, el checkin fatal, mala atenci√≥n en recepci√≥n y ningun servicio incluido como puede ser gimnasio, para un cliente tarjeta nh gold ninguna cortes√≠a y encima me hacen firmar que no he usado el minibar cuando yo ya se que no he usado el minibar si le pongo 2 estrellas es por ser justo con la habitaci√≥n que si lo merece por lo dem√°s mejor no ir",2,2016,09,30
30,"Dieses Mal eine sehr schlechte Erfahrung, w√§hrend mich ansonsten in diesem Hotel immer sehr wohl gef√ºhlt habe!","Auf Grund dieser jetzt gemachten Erfahrung kann ich nicht sagen, dass ich mich wie in einem 5 Sterne Hotel gef√ºhlt habe.

30,Non proprio 5 stelle,"Ho soggiornato 5 notti in questo hotel.
La camera (per fumatori) non era molto pulita. Nel bagno c'era della cenere precedente al nostro arrivo e per terra un accendino rotto.
Inoltre il fatto che il bagno funzionasse da anticamera costringe ad illuminare la stanza di notte e questo √® un fastidio per l'altra persona che sta dormendo.
Gioie e dolori di questo posto le fanno i dipendenti. Abbiamo avuto un trattamento super da alcuni e un trattamento terribile da altri.
Le indicazioni alla reception non sono state precise e nemmeno quando abbiamo avuto un problema in citt√†  nel mezzo della notte sono riusciti ad aiutarci e abbiamo dovuto trovare una soluzione da sole.
Il personale del ristorante sembra poco preparato mentre quello della colazione √® adorabile.
La lontananza dal centro e questi dettagli non me lo faranno scegliere per la prossima volta.",4,2016,09,21
30,Dise√±o sorprendente,"Un hotel que no est√° situado en Barcelona, pero que tiene un dise√±o sorprendente. Habitaciones c√≥modas, con detalles de decorado de buen gusto. Desayuno variado y de muy buen sabor. Gente muy servicial 
",5,2016,09,19
30,Bien sin cubrir expectativas ,"Si lo comparamos con √©l Hesperia Madrid, tambi√©n de 5 estrellas, hay diferencias significativas. Compararlos me parece lo m√°s acertado trat√°ndose de dos hoteles de la misma cadena, categor√≠a y en grandes ciudades.

He de decir que la habitaci√≥n si es bastante c√≥moda, amplia y limpia.

El hotel en s√≠ est√° muy bien, decoraci√≥n √±, lobby espacioso, muy bien servicio del bar y restaurante excelente.

En la recepci√≥n, me sorprende que no hayan sido tan atentos como el Hesperia Madrid. No informan del horario del desayuno, ni en qu√© planta es, etc. Adem√°s de tener que bajar a la recepci√≥n porque la tarjeta de la habitaci√≥n no funcionaba, eso puede pasar pero me resulta un tanto desconcertante que te digan: ""es que tiene que introducir y sacar la tarjeta r√°pidamente o se bloquea""; de acuerdo pero deber√≠a informase.

La primera impresi√≥n al entrar en la habitaci√≥n y encontrarte en el ba√±o resulta un tanto rara y con tanto espejo desubica un poco pero te acostumbras.

El desayuno bastante bien pero lejos del nivel del Hesperia Madrid, esperaba mucho m√°s.

En t√©rminos generales dir√≠a que un tanto corto para un 5 estrellas.

30,Bellissimo,"Io e il mio ragazzo abbiamo soggiornato qui per 3 notti, e ci siamo trovati benissimo.
Vicino all'aeroporto e a 20 minuti di metro dal centro (con fermata vicinissima), questo hotel ha soddisfatto le nostre aspettative, soprattutto dal punto di vista estetico. Ci hanno pure dato una stanza migliore di quella prenotata!
Bellissima camera e grandiosa vista sulla citt√†.

Per√≤, ci sono stati dei difetti.
1) una scritta a mano in pennarello bianco sullo specchio del bagno. Onestamente, non l'abbiamo capita. Ospiti precedenti! Camerieri? Non mi √® sembrato molto professionale.
2) non ci √® stato rifornito il latte e il caff√® nel vassoio delle bevande;
3) in uno dei cassetti del comodino, uno dei rivestimenti si era tolto;
4) in un albergo a 5 stelle ti aspetteresti almeno la colazione inclusa... non ti aspetteresti di pagare ‚Ç¨38 euro a notte extra!
5) tutti i servizi, tra cui piscina e spa, erano a pagamento.
6) servizio shuttle insufficiente rispetto alla domanda. Non siamo mai riusciti a prenderlo.
7) le comunicazioni lasciate in camera dovrebbero essere scritte anche in inglese, non solo in spagnolo. Va bene che parlo italiano e un po' lo spagnolo lo capisco, per√≤ non √® molto professionale.

Nonostante ci√≤, ci ritornerei.

30,muy lindo hotel cercano al Aeropuerto,"me aloje en este hotel durante 2 noches. el servicio fue muy bueno , la atencion del personal excelente en todo momento. El hotel cuenta con servicio de Shuttle bus gratuito  al Aeropuerto, al Hotel NH cALDERON el cual se encuentra a pocas cuadras de Plaza Catalunya y ademas a Gava beach. 
No es cerca del centro pero al ubicarse a tan solo a 100 m caminando del metro estacion Hospital de Bellvitge de la linea 1 (roja) pueden llegar sin mayores complicaciones a sitios de interes. 
El hotel Hesperia cuenta con instalaciones modernas y es bonito se merece las 5 estrellas-  las habitaciones son amplias y las camas super comodas. Desde los pisos mas altos se tiene una muy linda vista de la ciudad. Buena relacion precio /calidad 
El servicio de Spa y pileta no estan incluidos y tienen un costo aprox de E  14 por persona. El personal es muy atento, el chofer del shuttle Alberto muy simpatico y amable. 
Lo malo del hotel el wifi en la habitacion no fue bueno ya que se cortaba siempre y el agua del minibar tenia un costo de 6 EUROS. Me parecio que por la categoria del hotel tendrian que haber sido de cortesia. 
Lo recomiendo para aquellos que quieran alojarse en un muy buen hotel pero mas economico que cualquier otro localizado en el centro y ademas tengan mucho equipaje por contar con shuttle bus gratutito",4,2016,08,28

30,Buen hotel,Buen hotel. Nos hospedamos en una suite ejecutiva en la planta 25 con buenas vistas y acceso al tower club. Habitaci√≥n grande y con todo lujo de detalles.

Recomendable en general aunque le falta algo de encanto para ser un hotel de esta categor√≠a,4,2016,08,11
30,Molto buono!,"Ottimo hotel per chi viene a Barcellona e sa districarsi con la lingua e muoversi con i mezzi pubblici.

Faltaba un colgador de toallas, que estuvo descolgado y guardado en un armario y en el techo de la ducha hab√≠a humedades...
Cierto es que nos cambiaron la habitaci√≥n unos pisos m√°s arriba despu√©s de quejarnos, pero lo sucedido es inaceptable en un hotel de 5 estrellas.

Super freundliches Personal, reichhaltiges und leckeres Fr√ºhst√ºcksb√ºffet. Sehr leckeres Essen im Restaurant, zu einem guten Preisleistungsverh√§ltnis auch die Weine sind sehr fair kalkuliert etwas anders sieht es in der Hotelbar aus, die Drinks da geh√∂rten mit Abstand zu den teuersten die wir in Barcelona getrunken haben. Die Lage etwas au√üerhalb der City ist kein Problem es gibt eine Metrostation direkt vor der T√ºr, ferner f√§hrt auch mehrmals t√§glich ein Shuttle nach Catalunya.

Quindi consigliato solo a chi a disposizione molti giorni per visitare la citt√†, altrimenti converrebbe un hotel in centro ma con qualche stella in meno. L'hotel √® della catena NH e assicura una ottima pulizia della camera. La camera √® molto bella, anche se un 5 stelle italiano offre qualcosa di pi√π. Il personale √® molto disponibile. Essendo un grattacielo, una parete √® totalmente in vetro e non c'√® quindi possibilit√† di apertura. La vista di notte √® formidabile.",5,2016,08,01

Asi que para que ella no sospechara,la tarde de la cena fui,hice el check-in,grabe un video en la habitacion,deje el regalo en la mesita  de noche y volvi,fuimos a cenar y...ahi el hotel siguio sorprendiendome,porque en la cena nos dijeron que podiamos pedir lo que querais,no sobre el menu acordado,lo que querais de la carta!!..en los postres,y aprovechando la visita al ba√±o de mi compa√±era,el camarero se me acercoy coento que ""esta todo preparado en la habitacion""..el que???..
cuando subimos con la excusa de ver el restaurant superior(ella no sabia nada de quedarnos)y vio que metia la llave electronica en la puerta,,la sorpresa fue mayuscula,ya que habian dispuesto una botella de cava con fresas con chocolate y la cama estaba llena de petalos de rosas,amen del desayuno en la habitacion....
huelga decir que todo estaba impecable,que el servicio fue exquisito y la cena a la altura,porlo que solo puedo tener palabras de agradecimiento a todo el personal implicado y en especial a Rocio,,,aunque esto ocurrio  hace un par de a√±os,por fecha no lo puedo poner,pero es una critica tan real (lo juro!)y especial que tenia que estar en Tripadvisor como reconocimento al Hesperia Tower,Nunca es tarde.",5,2016,07,10

30,Sch√∂nes Hotel mit (kleinen) M√§ngeln,"Wir waren f√ºr 4 Tage vor unserer Kreuzfahrt in diesem Hotel. Unser Zimmer befand sich im 24. Stockwerk. Die Zimmer sind sehr gro√ü, das Badezimmer ger√§umig und es gibt eine Art begehbaren Kleiderschrank mit Spiegelwand, soda√ü man problemlos auch den Inhalt von gr√∂√üeren Koffern wunderbar verstauen kann. Die Aussicht war sensationell, zumal die Fenster ebenfalls riesig sind. Allerdings sind die Zimmer ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen. Die M√∂bel waren leider leicht verschrammt und zerkratzt, der Teppich hatte Flecken, etc. So erging es uns leider im kompletten Hotel. Auf den ersten Eindruck wirkte alles sch√∂n und eindrucksvoll, aber auf den zweiten Blick sah man, da√ü das Hotel schon bessere Tage gesehen hatte. Ein absoluter Pluspunkt war das Fr√ºhst√ºck. Die Auswahl war absolut riesig, die Kellner waren fleissig und bem√ºht und es gab alles, was das Herz begehrte von diversen K√§sesorten √ºber frisches Obst, frisch gepresste S√§fte, Lachs, etc. Schade war, da√ü das Hotel auf diversen Seiten der Reiseveranstalter Werbung f√ºr Spa bzw Pool macht, aber nicht erw√§hnt, da√ü man diese Annehmlichkeiten nur dann nutzen kann, wenn man einen Extra-Betrag (Tages-Pass) zahlt. Das Hotel ist zwar au√üerhalb gelegen, aber da die Metro-Station in Fu√ün√§he liegt (ca 5 min), kann von dort aus in ca 15 min ins Zentrum fahren. Toll ist, da√ü es einen kostenlosen Shuttle-Service gibt, der zu bestimmten Uhrzeiten an den √∂ffentlichen Strand f√§hrt.",4,2016,06,01

30,Personal de recepci√≥n de 3*,"Me he alojado durante 4 d√≠as en el hotel Hesperia Fira y he de decir que el personal de recepci√≥n del Hesperia Tower, comparten recepci√≥n, esta muy por debajo de lo esperado para un hotel de 5 estrellas. 

En varias consultas que le realice durante el turno de ma√±ana se mostraron antip√°ticos y poco resolutivos a la hora de responder a mis dudas, cosa que no paso con el personal de noche que en todo momento mostraron su predisposici√≥n para ayudar en todo lo posible.

El servicio de shuttle funciona correctamente y sus conductores son un punto a favor para este servicio.

La ubicaci√≥n un poco alejado para mi gusto, pero tienes taxis y parking y una parada de autob√∫s y metro muy cerca. 
Ahora lo menos bueno; una noche est√°bamos muy cansados y quer√≠amos cenar algo ligero y r√°pido para poder ir a descansar cuanto antes. Pedimos en el bar algo ligero para cenar y un camarero nos dijo que la cocina estaba cerrada, que pod√≠amos cenar en el restaurante. Le contest√© que no ten√≠amos ganas de una cena formal, que solo quer√≠amos algo r√°pido, nos volvi√≥ a decir que no pod√≠a servir nada. Pedimos unos caf√©s y nos dijo que nos sent√°ramos en una mesa. Al rato aparece una compa√±era con los caf√©s, sin galletas ni nada (Cuentas 4‚Ç¨ cada caf√© que menos que un dulce) le pide mi compa√±ero si tiene algo dulce para acompa√±arlo, ella mira al camarero que nos dijo que no nos daba nada de cenar y nos dice que no. Vamos a pagar, y nos quedamos at√≥nitos cuanto vemos que est√°n sacando varias ensaladas y unas tortillas a una mesa que se av√≠an sentado un buen rato despu√©s que nosotros. Creo que del cabreo me sent√≥ mal el caf√©. jaja",3,2016,05,06
30,Ottimo,"Hotel in buona posizione a dieci minuti dall'aeroporto e con fermata metropolitana a 150 metri per poter raggiungere il centro in circa 25 minuti.  Vista su Barcellona fantastica. Personale cortese e disponibile e soprattutto poliglotta. Camere confortevoli e luminose e pulite, con ampie vetrate da dove si pu√≤ ammirare Barcellona, naturalmente facendosi assegnare la camera sul lato nord. Ottima colazione. internazionale con personale molto disponibile e cortese. Ristorante. ottimo con bellissima atmosfera. ",5,2016,04,29
30,Es bueno,"La verdad que por el precio que se paga no esperas menos...la habitaci√≥n bien de tama√±o..sof√°, cama grande, tele grande..lavabo mucho espejo en negro...la verdad me gustar√≠a si fuera mas moderno..los espacios del hotel grande... El personal muy amable...el desayuno 23 o 25 euros no recuerdo...me parece muy caro para lo que es, eso si de calidad y variedad.   no se pone en duda

30,Han olvidado la cortes√≠a en recepci√≥n,"Estuve hace cuatro a√±os y mi experiencia fue radicalmente opuesta a la que acabo de tener la pasada semana. ¬øalgo que ver con el cambio de marca?
En la recepci√≥n han eliminado la cortes√≠a como marca de la casa. Se permiten intentar enga√±ar al cliente con juegos sem√°nticos. Si un servicio es anunciado en su web y en las OTAs, ese servicio es un DEBER, no un favor que le hacen al cliente. Su servicio de transfer es una quimera, y se permiten decirle a este cliente que es un favor que me est√°n haciendo y se lo tengo que agradecer. Pues bien, este cliente ha elegido este hotel esta vez precisamente porque anunciaban transfer al aeropuerto, y no pude usarlo ni a la ida ni a la vuelta. Terminan a las 20:30 por la noche, y por la ma√±ana tienen uno cada hora.... excepto a las 10:20.  Una verg√ºenza, un insulto y un desaf√≠o. Deber√≠an aprender educaci√≥n y cortes√≠a del botones, un ejemplo de profesionalidad.
El restaurante de desayuno, impecable, sobresaliente. En calidad y servicio.
La habitaci√≥n, soberbia. Inmejorable por el precio. Limp√≠sima.",2,2016,04,28
30,Bien pero mejorable,"La habitaci√≥n Genial y el personal muy amable.
Sorprende que el parquing no quede incluido en el precio de la estancia, pues tanto la ubicaci√≥n como el entorno del hotel obliga a utilizarlo.
El Spa tampoco esta incluido, pero se entiende porque te ofrecen utilizar las instalaciones del gimnasio Metrop√≥litan que linda con el hotel.
Este gimnasio es espectacular, pero la zona de Spa ..... Es propia de un gimnasio,.... si se busca un fin de semana rom√°ntico en pareja, no hace falta ir.
El restaurante muy bonito y el servicio muy amables y simp√°ticos . La presentaci√≥n muy bien, pero la comida... (cogimos men√∫) .... un filete o entrecot pedido poco hecho se sirve acabado de hacer! no se deja hecho en un escalfaplatos durante el rato que se tarde en servir, ni se recalienta. No nos quejamos porqu√© no era culpa del camarero y era muy tarde, pero si no puedes servir un plato por la hora que das la mesa, no lo ofreces como opci√≥n.",3,2016,04,28
30,Bello ma lontano dal centro,"L'hotel √® sicuramente bello, breakfast ottimo e abbondante, camere accoglienti che purtroppo non √® possibile ventilare naturalmente per cui c'√® un po' di ristagno d'aria.
Lo sceglierei per lavoro ma non per turismo poich√© per raggiungere il centro ci vuole una mezz'ora di metropolitana. Ottimo, anche se non economico, il ristorante al secondo piano.",4,2016,04,25

30,Agradable y con una comida excelente.,"Te hace sentir como en casa, muy bien atendido y una comida excelente (serviciales y muy agradables). Las habitaciones amplias y con unas vistas de todo Barcelona desde la planta 22. 
Un error por parte de un Hotel de 5 estrellas que te cobren por entrar en la piscina, que por otro lado no es ni del hotel, sino del gimnasio. Para llegar hasta ella deber√°s pasar por medio del gimnasio donde se encuentran todas las personas externas al hotel realizando ejercicio.

30,QUE GUSTAZO¬°¬°¬°,"He estado en otros hoteles de cadena NH y este ha sido el que mejor opinion me merece.

Excelente habitaci√≥n , confortable,grande ,superba√±o con la unica pega que siempre tiene la cadena  NH   que no dispongan en los ba√±os de todos los complementos de ba√±o y siempre los tengas que pedir en recepci√≥n , stick dental,peine,maquinillas de afeitar...etc...en  3* se acepta pero en un 5* no se puede aceptar.

30,EN GENERAL UN 8,"Hotel de lujo, con un dise√±o vanguardista, muy limpio y personal amable. Desayunos excelentes y abundantes, para cenar deja bastante que desear para ser el hotel que es, en un lateral de recepci√≥n y con una carta muy escasa en la que hab√≠a mas bebida que comida. Las vistas, por muy arriba que est√©s, tampoco son excelentes teniendo en cuenta en la ciudad que est√°.",4,2016,03,28
30,"Gran servicio, buena comida y cerca aeropuerto","Tienen un gran servicio, con un personal muy atento. Especialmente los camareros de desayunos en el Restaurante Azimut de la 4¬™ Planta del Hotel.

30,Escapada romantica,"Hola quisiera comentar mi experiencia en el hotel hesperia tower.
Mi marido Pepe siempre me hace sorpresasy  esta vez yo decidi tomar la iniciativa.
Reserve una habitacion duplex espectacular calidad precio .tambien contrate unos vips que tambien fueron espectaculares calidad precio.
Cenamos en la habitacion mediante servicio de roomservice .Nos atendio un chico llamado Andres creo recordar ponia en la chapa de su camisa.
Fue super amable y teniamos un poco de hambre jee y le pedi lo trajera lo antes posible y en 20 minutos ya tenia pedido en la habitacion.
Al dia siguiente fuimos desayunar a la 4 planta restaurante azimut.
Nos gustaron mucho micho mucho tres cosas; la capacidad de hacer pasar un buen rato de los camareros a Pepe y a mi,la variedad tan grande de productos en el bufete.
Y por utimo destacar la sonrisa contagiosa de manuel q se acerco mesa con una sonrisa enorme se presento y nos dijo que era nuestro camarero para lo que necesitaramos.
Nos encanto experiencia.
Os invito la probeissssssss",5,2016,03,28
30,Amplia  oferta gastron√≥mica,Muy  positivo  que te ofrezcan opciones para  comer cuando llegas fuera de horario del restaurante (decoraci√≥n muy rom√°ntica por cierto). Nos encant√≥ el detalle de las fresitas ba√±adas en chocolate y la botella de cava catal√°n muy fresca en la habitaci√≥n nada m√°s llegar.,5,2016,03,27
30,"Lussuoso, ma fuori mano","Abbiamo trascorso 4 giorni in questa struttura di lusso. I comfort non mancavano, camera spaziosa e finemente rifinita, bagno da incanto, con doccia multifunzione e pseudo cabina armadio, anche se abbiamo trovato alcune pecche: un solo paio di ciabatte e la mancanza dello scopino per il wc.
Il resto della struttura davvero di qualit√† e ottimi e abbondanti anche i 3 pasti giornalieri. Il personale sempre sorridente e disponibile, ma non portato per la lingua italiana.
Purtroppo la struttura √® collocata in una zona di periferia, dotata comunque di tutti i servizi e, per muoversi verso il centro, bisogna prendere i taxi o la metro , con fermata a 10 minuti a piedi.

30,Moderno y elegante ,"Excelente hotel 5 estrellas. Habitaciones amplias y c√≥modas. Ducha Finlandesa. Tres restaurantes y un completo spa. 
El desayuno muy completo y variado. Buena pacificaci√≥n y embutidos de calidad. 
La √∫nica contra es que queda algo alejado de la ciudad. Aunque la estaci√≥n del metro esta a poco m√°s de 100 metros y te deja en plaza Catalunya en media hora. ",4,2016,03,25
30,Marzo 2016,"Buena situaci√≥n para los que preferimos estar algo alejados del centro de las ciudades (cercano al aeropuerto del Prat). Confortables habitaciones con buenas vistas y habitaciones diferenciadas de fumadores.

30,Excelente hotel!!,"Este hotel cumpli√≥ todas mis expectativas. Instalaciones muy modernas, ascensores inteligentes, el desayuno muy variado y las habitaciones muy c√≥modas.
El inconveniente es que cerca no tiene mayores atracciones, para salir de ah√≠ solo lo puedes hacer en taxi pues caminando ser√° dif√≠cil peor si no conoces la zona. Algo positivo es que  est√° en Barcelona, una ciudad que por si es muy atractiva!!",4,2016,03,23
30,Unglaublicher Ausblick und super Hotel,"wir waren 3 Tage im Hesperia Tower Hotel.
Unser Zimmer war im 22. Stock. Es gibt 4 Lifte mit denen man fahren kann und ein System das den n√§hesten Lift aussucht, um die Fahrt so effizient wie m√∂glich zu halten.

Das Zimmer war sehr edel, sch√∂n sauber und die Aussicht war ein Traum. Wir haben vom Berg Tibidabo, √ºber die Sagrada Familia, bis hin zum Hafen alles aus dem Fenster gesehen (Barcelona bei Nacht ist wundersch√∂n!).

Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist sehr reichhaltig und es gibt eine super gro√üe Auswahl!
Die Kellner bringen einem immer ein hei√ües Getr√§nk oder frisch gepressten Orangensaft zum Tisch.
Das Restaurant soll am Dach des Hotels sein.
Wir haben es leider nicht bis dahin geschafft, aber es muss ein unglaublicher Ausblick sein. Wenn man vom Fr√ºhst√ºck aufs Abendessen schlie√üen m√∂chte, kann man auf jeden Fall von einem perfekt organisierten und h√∂chst leckeren Abendessen ausgehen!
Der Hotelservice ist sehr zuvorkommend und professionell.

Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder!!

ps: das Hotel ist zwar ein wenig weit weg vom Zentrum, aber die Metroanbindung ist genial! Au√üerdem wird ein gratis shuttleservice angeboten!",5,2016,03,21
30,Atenci√≥n excepcional,"He estado de visita en barcelona con mi pareja, me recomendaron este restaurante y vali√≥ la pena. El precio se justifica con el servicio de calidad y profesional.

30,Un gran findesemana,"Buenas tardes estuve con mi mujer Elisabeth. 
Me hab√≠an hablado muy bien por eso tenia muchas ganas de ir con mi mujer 
Yo trabajo en la hosteler√≠a y soy muy cr√≠tico pero esta vez tuve que decirle a mi mujer OLE OLE
S√≠ ole porque me encanta ver como hay camareros que disfrutan de su profesi√≥n eso transmite al cliente en este caso a mi mujer y yo bienestar sentirse especial.
Quiero remarcar la atenci√≥n de todas las √°reas de restauraci√≥n pero destacar por encima de todas roc√≠o la camarera que nos atendi√≥ los dos d√≠as y en el segundo ya sabia lo que tomaba sin tener que pedirlo adem√°s de estar atenta y en contacto directo con todos los clientes. 
Realmente felicidades  y obviamente volveremos. 
Tambi√©n  nos encant√≥ el caf√© las tortillas al gusto .. 
En fin os lo recomiendo. .",5,2016,03,18
30,Hotel de 2 estrellas que se dice de 5,"Hotel limpio, personal ""politicamente correcto y amable"" pero con servicio al cliente muy pobre. Para cualquier duda tienen una ""respuesta corporativa"" ensayada sin tomar en cuenta las verdaderas necesidades del cliente.
No se dejen enganiar por su publicidad! Hay que leer las ""pequenias letras"" de restricciones, porque no son transparentes en lo que ofrecen",1,2016,03,17

30,Keine 5 Sterne wert - nur noch 3,"Innert 10 Jahren wurde das Hotel heruntergewirtschaftet. Hygiene, Essen, Service, Zustand Geb√§ude und M√∂bel .....
Zimmer - in die Jahre gekommen, es wurde nicht investiert oder repariert, es fehlt ein Schminkspiegel der nicht repariert werden kann! Dusche - Warmwasser ging nur tr√∂pfchenweise, Holzschiene als Abdeckung f√ºr Schrankt√ºr abgebrochen, .... usw.
WLAN - unzureichende Funktionalit√§t
Kleidung des Personals - zerrissen, abgewetzt, mit grossen sichtbaren Flecken
Service - nur auf mehrfaches Verlangen unter Druck wird etwas erledigt, ansonsten hat sich das Personal bem√ºht
Fr√ºhst√ºck - es wird das Essen der vergangenen Konferenz angeboten, ansonsten ist das Fr√ºhst√ºck durchschnittlich, eher untypisch regional
U-Bahn und Taxi Stand vor der T√ºr
Fazit: selbst wenn ich wieder nach Barcelona zu einer Konferenz komme, werde ich mir lieber ein Hotel in der Stadt buchen, da auch der Weg ins Zentrum mit der U-Bahn und dem Taxi mind. 30 Minuten dauert, da das Essen im Hotel nicht empfehlenswert ist.",3,2016,03,07
30,Espectacular sala para grandes eventos,"Asist√≠ a este hotel para un evento de empresa, y nos reunieron en una gran sala que tenia capacidad para montar incluso un peque√±o escenario para que la empresa pudiera hacer un discurso. En la sala hab√≠a distribuidas muchas mesas redondas donde cab√≠an 10-12 personas, y donde nos sirvieron unos platos de excelente calidad y atendidos por un buen servicio, atentos en todo momento. Posteriormente, nos llevaron a una zona que era la discoteca del hotel, con m√∫sica del momento, y donde pudimos acabar el evento con muy buen sabor de boca.",5,2016,03,05
30,Muy bueno. Pero podr√≠a mejorar,"El hotel esta muy bien, la atenci√≥n excelente por parte de Sara y Esteban y en general. Las habitaciones amplias y limpias, el ba√±o perfecto todo muy bien. Buenas vistas... etc etc.
Lo que creo que deben mejorar es el desayuno, porque para un 5 estrellas deja mucho que desear. 1 podr√≠an cocinarte algo al momento como en algunos 3/4 estrellas que he estado. 2 la atenci√≥n un poco lenta, el camarero retira los platos a los 15 minutos o tenes que llamarlos, no est√°n a lo que tienen que estar. 
Soy un poco critico porque es un 5 estrellas, y en algunos aspectos se comporta como un 3 estrellas.",4,2016,02,29
30,buena estancia,"hotel con parada de metro cercana,estancia agradable,buena atencion, tambien el personal, especialmente issa y gemma de recepcion, julio de comedor y ambos choferes del transfer. gracias por hacer agradable nuestra estancia
",5,2016,02,25
30,Decepcionante para un hotel de 5*,"Nos decidimos por el Hesperia Tower por el prestigio que tiene y por el restaurante de Santi Santamar√≠a. Pagamos ‚Ç¨600 por tres noches lo cual no es moco de pavo pero si es un 5* y las fechas coinciden con la feria mundial de m√≥viles pues tampoco es muy descabellado. 
Llegamos al hotel sobre las 10 de la noche y al hacer el checking pedimos a la recepcionista si pod√≠a llamar al restaurante para ver si nos pod√≠an dar una mesa. Llam√≥ y me qued√© at√≥nita cuando la o√≠ decir ""Hola, a que no tienes mesa para dos en este momento?"". Lo que yo espero de un recepcionista de hotel de cualquier categor√≠a ser√≠a ""Tengo a dos clientes del hotel que acaban de llegar y les gustar√≠a cenar en el restaurante, hay manera de que les encuentres un sitio?"". Cuando cuelga la recepcionista nos dice ""Pues no, no tienen sitio. Y cerca del hotel lo tienen mal porque no hay nada"". ¬°Se me sal√≠an los ojos de las √≥rbitas! Ni se molest√≥ en darnos sugerencias de restaurantes aunque no estuvieran cerca cosa que he visto hacer a recepcionistas de las pensiones m√°s modestas que uno pueda imaginar. Acto seguido la recepcionista nos dice que no tenemos el desayuno incluir en nuestra reserva. Si lo a√±adimos en ese instante ser√≠an solo ‚Ç¨22.50 por persona pero si lo cogemos por d√≠as sueltos ser√≠an ‚Ç¨25.00 por persona. Le dijimos que no queremos desayuno porque solo tomamos un caf√© y ah√≠ qued√≥ la cosa. Al d√≠a siguiente bajamos a las 8:30 con √°nimo de tomarnos nuestros caf√©s matutinos y en recepci√≥n nos dicen que la cafeter√≠a no abre hasta las 10:00 y que en el sal√≥n donde sirven los desayunos no nos pondr√°n solo un caf√© sino que tendr√≠amos que contratar el desayuno de ‚Ç¨25.00. Obviamente, nos fuimos del hotel sin tomarnos el caf√©.

En cuanto a las habitaciones, para una habitaci√≥n ""doble superior"" encuentro que el tama√±o es peque√±o pero no est√° tan mal. El tama√±o del ba√±o es muy generoso. La cama es s√∫per c√≥moda y las almohadas muy bien tambi√©n. Ponen dos albornoces (pero solo un par de zapatillas). Tambi√©n ponen una toalla de ducha y una toalla de mano por persona. Los productos de aseo (gel de ba√±o, champ√∫ y mascarilla de pelo) no son de ninguna marca especifica pero est√°n bien. No hay pasta de dientes ni cepillos de dientes pero si los pides -nosotros nos olvidamos los nuestros y tuvimos que pedirlos- te los suben a la habitaci√≥n. 

Lo que no admito en un hotel de 5* es que el lacado del mueble bar tenga ostentosas marcas de haberse quemado con un vaso caliente, que haya √≥xido en las juntas de las duchas, ni que la pintura del techo del ba√±o se empiece a descolgar. 

El √∫ltimo d√≠a nos levantamos m√°s tarde y gracias a ello pudimos tomarnos un caf√© en la cafeter√≠a. El caf√© estupendo y el trato del camarero tambi√©n. Me encantaron los sillones de la cafeter√≠a. En la cafeter√≠a tambi√©n ten√≠an una selecci√≥n de prensa local que agradec√≠ mucho

Podr√≠a ser un hotel estupendo si lo cuidasen un poco m√°s y si ense√±aran a los recepcionistas unos m√≠nimos de cortes√≠a para al menos hacer creer al cliente que les importa. 

En cuanto a la ubicaci√≥n, el hotel est√° en una zona que parece un pol√≠gono industrial por lo que las vistas no son todo lo bonitas que uno espera cuando te venden ""habitaci√≥n doble superior con vistas"" aunque indudablemente, gracias a la altura del hotel, son unas vistas despejad√≠simas. De d√≠a son vistas ""industriales"" pero por la noche son vistas muy bonitas gracias a las luces de la ciudad. El mar se ve pero no en primera l√≠nea.",2,2016,02,24
30,Perfecto hotel de negocios y congresos,"2 noches en este hotel en febrero 2016 por asistencia a un congreso. Hotel en las afueras (Bellvitge) pero cercano a espacios de congresos y negocios (Fira) 
Amplios espacios, vistas a la ciudad espectaculares (habitaci√≥n en piso 21) ya que toda la pared exterior es cristal de suelo a techo. Sistema de cierre de cortinas autom√°tico, con buen funcionamiento. Espacio de dormitorio con cama amplia y c√≥moda, con espacio para zona de descanso y lectura con un sof√° c√≥modo al lado de los ventanales. Botella diaria de agua y √∫tiles para infusiones o caf√© cortes√≠a del hotel. 
Los espacios de almacenaje de ropa y maleta est√°n en el BA√ëO, el cual no es cerrado sino que forma como una habitaci√≥n m√°s al entrar en la habitaci√≥n. Consta de grandes espejos y amplio lavabo doble con elementos de aseo completos (gel, champ√∫, crema de manos, etc), todo revestido de lo que parece granito negro lo que le da una luminosidad especial. Inodoro en peque√±o cuarto aislado por puerta de cristal  y una DUCHA estupenda, amplia, cerrada en un espacio perfectamente aislado por una puerta completa de cristal, conformando casi una peque√±a habitaci√≥n. Consta de sistema de ""lluvia"", telefonillo y chorros relajantes, con muy buena presi√≥n de agua y temperatura mantenida en todo momento. La mejor manera de empezar el d√≠a largo de congreso. 
DESAYUNO variado, servido en la 4¬™ planta, creo recordar. Muy completo, variedad de productos calientes y reposter√≠a variada y de muy buena calidad. Buen caf√©, servido por los camareros, eficientes, no hay m√°quinas de caf√©s variados tipo nespresso que parece que es caracter√≠stica com√∫n en los √∫ltimos tiempos.
Check-in/out r√°pido y sin esperas. Personal eficiente y entrenado, muy amables.
Cena en restaurante en piso 3¬∫. Personal de hosteler√≠a muy agradable y eficiente.
Hotel alejado del centro pero con taxis a la puerta y l√≠nea 1 de metro a unos pasos del hotel que te deja en poco tiempo en la Plaza de Catalu√±a sin transbordos.
En resumen: 5 puntos, Hotel excelente.",5,2016,02,24

30,Tiene mucho que desear,"El hotel es muy bonito y lujoso, pero sinceramente hay muchas cosas que para ser un hotel 5 estrellas no van acordes a ello. Primero, me parece un poco vergonzoso que un hotel de 5 estrellas no tenga zumo de naranja natural, eso es algo que encuentras en hoteles de menos estrellas.... Asimismo, creo que pagando lo que se paga deber√≠a de ofrecer un cepillo de dientes entre las otras cosas que s√≠ ofrece.

30,buono,"non a livello di un cinque stelle italiano in quanto presenta alcuni difetti.
Tutto sommato un buon Hotel, non comodo al centro (anche se √® a due passi dalla linea metro nr.1), con una buona insonorizzazione.
Difetti:
un po' di odore di fumo i stanza;
sistema di ventilazione non troppo pratico (io non riuscivo ad avere meno di 24¬∞ in camera)
io sono stato a capodanno √® c'era una forte presenza di ""ragazzi"" (non dico la nazionalit√† per non essere scortese ne per generalizzare) spesso ubriachi o comunque chiassosi nei corridoi per cui, nonostante la buona insonorizzazione, era quanto meno fastidioso.

Este incidente fue notificado a recepci√≥n que r√°pidamente lo solucionaron. La reserva estaba realizada para tres personas, la cama adicional no estaba preparada ( dimos por supuesto que como en otros hoteles de esta cadena hacen la apertura de cama y preparar√≠an la cama adicional ) nuestra sorpresa fue que al llegar de la fiesta de fin de a√±o no hab√≠an hecho nada, como era muy tarde no pedimos que montar√°n la cama.
Realmente estos dos percance nos dejaron un mal sabor, teniendo en cuenta que la habitaci√≥n estaba  muy bien y las vistas de la entrada de Barcelona son geniales. Respecto a la cena de fin de a√±o y la fiesta posterior decir que estuvo realmente muy bien. ",3,2016,01,04
30,"Bella esperienza, ma...","Bella esperienza.
Albergo situato a pochi minuti in taxi (circa 20‚Ç¨) dall'aeroporto El Prat, ma comunque vicino alla fermata della linea Rossa metropolitana (L1 - capolinea Hospital de Bellvitge).
Abbiamo trascorso solamente 2 notti, e nonostante ci√≤ siamo riusciti a visitare una buona parte di Barcellona.
Avevamo prenotato una camera con vista panoramica ed al nostro arrivo ci hanno assegnato una camera ad un piano alto con vista dell'aeroporto: di panoramico quindi c'era ben poco!
Chiedendo un cambio della stanza c'√® stato detto che non avevano disponibili altre stanze con letti matrimoniali con vista della citt√†.
Attenti quindi quando prenotate a chiedere una camera panoramica con vista della citt√†.
Inoltre abbiamo dimenticato di portare lo spazzolino da denti. In stanza ci siamo accorti che non c'erano stati dati in dotazione. Anche richiedendoli alla reception abbiamo dovuto comprarli perch√© non ci sono stati forniti: da un 5 stelle e come cliente NH Reward Gold mi sarei aspettato di pi√π.

El desayuno es espl√©ndido.  El restaurante muy bueno aunque la iluminaci√≥n es m√≠nima no viendo uno lo que come y los precios algo elevados.  Igualmente elevados los precios de las bebidas en el bar.  Dado que no existe alrededor muchas opciones, creo que se abusa del precio del bar.

30,Buen hotel para visitar la ciudad,"Nos alojamos en el hotel para nuestra visita a Barcelona. El hotel es impresionante, estuvimos en una suite en una de las plantas superiores y las vistas a la ciudad son muy bonitas. La habitaci√≥n muy grande y bien cuidada. El ba√±o con ba√±era hidromasaje, una gozada y limpia. Lo √∫nico que se echaba de menos es un armario ""normal"" para guardar la ropa cuando se viaja ora varios d√≠as ya que el perchero est√° en el ba√±o y en la habitaci√≥n hay otro armario con minibar pero no tiene para colgar ropa y no es muy grande. 
La comunicaci√≥n con la ciudad es muy buena estando en poco m√°s de 15 minutos en el centro de Barcelona. Hay un servicio de lanzadera pero que en la pr√°ctica es dif√≠cil de usar ya que la furgoneta solo puede llevar clientes.
Por otro lado, el servicio de desayuno es muy correcto todo fresco y con variedad, aunque he de puntualizar de que no me gusta cuando falta algo de un buffet y no lo reponen por qu√© faltan 15 minutos para cerrar. Pero tambi√©n he de decir que ped√≠ y me llevaron la comida a la mesa y repusieron en el lineal.
Como √∫ltimo punto rese√±ar que el servicio de habitaciones es muy r√°pido y efectivo.

La gente encantadora y el servicio siempre excelente. El desayuino con una variedad incre√≠ble y la comida del room service muy buena.
Queda cerca del metro, linea 5 y Fira queda a menos de diez minutos en taxi.
Lo √∫nico malo es que no tiene ginmasio propio, y para hacer ejercicio tienes que ir al gimnasio de al lado y te cobran 14 euros para ir, lo que me apreci√≥ un robo ya que yo solo uso el gimnasio media hora al d√≠a, lo expliqu√© y no les import√≥",4,2015,12,02

Al volver a la suite, nos preparamos para la cena en el restaurante del hotel, sin duda con una decoraci√≥n de muy buen gusto y la comida de calidad y muy buena, de 10 .  El trato de los camareros excepcional . Al subir a la suite mi pareja no sab√≠a lo que le esperaba, nos hab√≠an preparado el jacuzzi con p√©talos de rosa, velas, cava y fresas con chocolate.

En la planta superior, una cama enorme con un jacuzzi estupendo y televisi√≥n. Adem√°s hay otro aseo y una ducha.
Totalmente recomendable para parejas.
El desayuno es muy completo tipo buffet con productos de primer√≠sima calidad. Un zumo de naranja natural muy rico y unos embutidos ib√©ricos, completan el desayuno perfecto. El personal de desayunos es muy atento y amable.
Nos han hecho sentir muy especiales.

30,Il migliore in cui sia mai stata,"Pu√≤ darsi che non sia un' assidua frequentatrice dei cinque stelle ma a me quest' albergo √® parso semplicemente fantastico. L' arredo √® moderno, ben tenuto, non scontato... Io l'ho adorato. La nostra stanza era soltanto all' ottavo piano e la vista era strepitosa. Le camere ampie, pulitissime, finanche la moquette, e dotate di ogni comfort. C' era persino la crema per le mani che avevo dimenticato di mettere in valigia. Il valore aggiunto, essendo leggermente fuori mano, √® stata la navetta gratuita da e per i luoghi di interesse. I servizi sono un po' pi√π cari degli hotel medi ma si tratta pur sempre di un 5 stelle. Per me √® super! ",5,2015,11,15

30,Bello solo da fuori,"L'hotel fa sicuramente impressione visto dalla strada, visto da dentro scopri una montagna di problemini che in un 5 stelle non sono accettabili.
Arriviamo in stanza √® la luce della doccia era bruciata, la crema data in dotazione dall'hotel era gi√† stata aperta ed usata da un'altra persona, il Phon faceva un rumore assurdo di ferraglia e dopo 10 secondi puzzava di bruciato, mi sono affrettato a spegnerlo prima che mi scaricasse la corrente addosso.
Prendo un cuscino in dotazione come scorta ed era sporco in maniera assurda, ma da quanto tempo nessuno lo guardava ??
Un solo paio di ciabattine da camera quando la stanza √® matrimoniale, avevano paura di spendere ??
Dulcis in fundo quando la mattina prendo l'ascensore per uscire dall'hotel passo piu' di 20 minuti chiuso dentro facendo il giro di tutti i piani uno per volta dal 11 al 29 a salire e  dal 29 allo 0 a scendere nonostante che ci fossero 4 ascensori modernissimi, forse era andato in tilt.
Pessima esperienza .",2,2015,11,09
30,Week end a Barcellona,"Abbiamo soggiornato qui 4 giorni per vedere Barcellona. La fermata  dell'autobus,venendo dall'aeroporto,dista circa 10 minuti dall'Hotel (a piedi) mentre la fermata della metro dista, dall'hotel,2 minuti (a piedi). 
La struttura moderna offre un ottimo comfort anche per coloro che viaggiano per svago e ,grazie alla SPA ( prezzo escluso dalla tariffa) consente il relax dopo giorni di cammino per le strade di Barcellona.
Il personale molto disponibile, fornito di mappe e cartine che consentono di orientarsi per la citt√† e preparato a rispondere domande in qualsiasi lingua.
Le camere pulite ed all'avanguardia regalano un'ottima vista sulla citt√† e ,pi√π in alto si va,pi√π il panorama √® gradevole (nonostante la posizione periferica, l'Hotel √® assolutamente comodo!) ; biancheria ed asciugamani puliti ogni giorno.
Il buffet della colazione offre ogni sorta di cibo internazionale e consente a chiunque una colazione abbondante.
Consigliamo la struttura a tutti coloro che vogliono essere appartati dal centro e pi√π vicini all'aeroporto; non √® tra i pi√π economici ma vale la pena soggiornarvi.

Consiglio per i turisti: acquistate la HOLA BCN per viaggiare comodamente in metro (possibile scegliere dai 2 giorni alla settimana): si acquista tranquillamente ad ogni fermata della metro  quindi non fatela via internet da casa perch√© diventerete matti per cercare dove ritirarla!

L'hotel √® vicino all'aeroporto (circa 15 minuti di taxi), la stazione dei taxi √® proprio di fronte all'ingresso dell'hotel.
L'hotel √® moderno, gli spazi comuni sono molto grandi, curati, e la struttura √® quella di un'enorme torre. 
Il personale della reception √® gentilissimo, disponibile e molti di loro conoscono perfettamente l'italiano.
La mia camera, al 23esimo piano, godeva di una bellissima vista sulla citt√†. La camera era molto spaziosa, bagno e soprattutto doccia molto grandi, molto spazio anche per l'armadio e diversi gli specchi.
L'ingresso della stanza era sul bagno, da qui si accedeva alla camera da letto. 
All'arrivo in camera mi √© stata offerta una bottiglia d'acqua ed alcuni biscotti/paste.
Il bagno era dotato di tutti gli accessori, shampoo, balsamo, crema mani, ecc.. e il phon era buono, non come quelli a muro di certi hotel. 
All'interno della camera erano disponibili anche alcune riviste in spagnolo.
Le camere non erano molto insonorizzate e si sentivano i rumori di quelle adiacenti.
La colazione, circa 20 euro, era servita in un ristorante al quarto piano. Ottima la scelta di dolce, salato, bevande. Peccato la fretta a sparecchiare dei camerieri.",4,2015,10,20
30,"Hotel di lusso, super consigliato per l'offerta HRS!","Abbiamo avuto l'occasione di soggionare tre notti presso questa struttura, grazie ad una promozione sul sito HRS.

Bagno con 2 lavabi (sanitari Roca). Accappatoio, ciabatte, fornite in camera, mancava lo scopino del WC. Voglio elogiare particolarmente il ragazzo della navetta, che ci accompagnava in centro, molto gentile, simpatico e professionale! 
Anzi, grazie a lui, (l'ultimo giorno) ci ha fatto mettere le valigie in reception; ci ha portato in centro e poi alle 18 circa ci ha riportato in hotel, dove da li ci ha portato in aereporto, direttamente davanti la porta ""Vueling"". Assolutamente impeccabile!",5,2015,10,20
30,Che spettacolo!,"Sono stata, purtroppo, soltanto due giorni in questo splendido albergo. Stile moderno e 29 piani di splendore. Illuminato la notte era qualcosa di grandioso! Mille colori e di gran classe e gusto la hall. Anche le stanze arredate con ottimo gusto ed ultra moderne. La stanza che mi √® piaciuta di pi√π sicuramente il bagno, dotato di una mega doccia che sembrava la sala di una discoteca per quanto grande :) bella e raffinata anche la camera da letto con tv 40 pollici al plasma, vista su barcellona e le tende automatiche. Colpita anche dagli ascensori, che si prenotano col touch screen. Colazione continentale pefetta, piena di alimenti dal dolce al salato (forse un po' cara ma del resto √® pur sempre un 5 stelle). Soddisfatta anche di quella ad ogni modo. L'albergo √® un po' distante dal centro (e lo sapevo) ma vicino c'√® la metro che in 10 minuti ti porta dove vuoi.

30,"Cuando el dise√±o barato se impone a la funcionalidad, resulta la incomodidad","UBICACION: Empecemos diciendo que no est√° en Barcelona, sno en Hospitalet, es decir a mitad de camino entre BCN y el Aeropuerto. El sitio no puede ser m√°s feo, al lado de una autopista con un barrio obrero  un lado , y  un poligono industrial al otro. Lo √∫nico bueno la cercan√≠a al Aeropuerto, aunque la carrera del taxi son 20 euros.

HABITACI√ìN: Entras de boca al cuarto de ba√±o, que consta de una cabina de ducha, una cabina de WC y un armario abierto donde se supone que tienes que guardar tus cosas. Si amigos, el  armario con tu ropa est√° dentro de un ba√±o lleno de vapor. Bien pensado. Adem√°s es muy glamouroso, todo negro: no se ve un pijo. 
La cama esta bien, las almohadas (una normal y otra cuadrada) no tanto, y lo mejor son las vistas hacia Barcelona y el mar.

EL MINIBAR: Una estafa..Adem√°s no puede ser que en un hotel de ¬ø5 estrellas? en Barcelona, donde el agua del grifo es asquerosa,  no te regale una botella de agua mineral cada d√≠a y que pretenda cobrarte 6 euros por ella. 

EL DESAYUNO. Bastante aceptable, especialmente el caf√© y el zumo de naranja. Lo √∫nico que me gust√≥.

LAS ZONAS COMUNES: A primera vista impresionan, pero acaban resultando de mala calidad. Los ba√±os del hall peque√±os, siempre encharcados por el dise√±o de los lavabos diminutos que salpican el agua hacia afuera. Las salas de convenciones, de altos techos, impresionantes, pero cuando llueve retumban como un tambor por que el tejado es de uralita. Los ascensores un infierno, los tienes que tomar si o si (30 plantas tiene el hotel, yo estaba en la 16) y s√≥lo hay 4 y controlados por un sistema ""inteligente"": por las ma√±anas te puedes pasar m√°s de 10 minutos esperando a que pare uno con sitio, es decir bajas a desayunar 10 minutos, subes de desayunar +10 minutos, bajas a la calle + 10 minutos = 30 mintuos perdidos todos los d√≠as. Justo lo que necesitas en un viaje de negocios.",2,2015,10,03

Ho prenotato l'hotel tramite un sito di intermediazione tra i pi√π famosi per un ottima tariffa, il rapporto qualit√† prezzo √® stato da 5 stelle. Avevo anche richiesto se possibile una camera in alto e sono stato accontento, la vista dal 22esimo piano domina tutta Barcellona qualcosa di incedibile. A mio avviso se dovete scegliere tra posizione o albergo incredibile ma un po fuori non c'√® storia sciogliete questo!",5,2015,09,29
30,Buon hotel,"Un hotel 5* dal design moderno, personale competente e gentilissimo, stanza comoda e pulita, bagno grande e ben accessoriato, vista molto bella dalle camere.
Un po' fuori mano, ma comodo per raggiungere l'aeroporto, da cui dista solo 10/15 minuti di taxi (l'hotel dispone anche di navetta per l'aeroporto).
La metropolitana si trova a 5 minuti a piedi dall'hotel e Plaza Catalunya √® raggiungibile in 20 minuti con la L1.
Volendo, si pu√≤ usufruire della navetta messa a disposizione dall'hotel per raggiungere Plaza Catalunya.

Tiene la parada de metro justamente delante y en 15 minutos en estas centro de Barcelona, adem√°s tiene un servicio de bus que es maravilloso, sobre todo su chofer Juan Carlos, que adem√°s de intentar hacer todo lo posible para adaptarse a tus rutas, te hace re√≠r y hace que no quieras bajarte nunca, es una persona incre√≠ble, Y sin duda tengo que destacar es al MARAVILLOSO EQUIPO DE RECEPCI√ìN. Te hacen sentir que estas en tu casa, y se preocupan por cada una de tus necesidades. Simp√°ticos ,amables, con una gran disposici√≥n a ayudarte en todo. Sin contar todos los detalles que tienen con el cliente. Si vais a Barcelona, desde luego que lo recomiendo. 
Gracias por hacer de estos d√≠as tan maravillosos que me disteis; Juan Carlos, Roger, Gema, Nicolas, Henrique...un 10 a todos !",5,2015,09,22
30,confortabilidad y calidad,"muy confortable con todas las comodidades. sin embargo, necesita que las habitaciones sean comprobadas antes de ser utilizadas. en mi √∫ltima estancia, faltaba el cable de la TV a la corriente el√©ctrica y el aire acondicionado perd√≠a agua y se qued√≥ el cuarto de ba√±o encharcado

30,Bellissimo!,"Hotel modernissimo,stanze grandi e pulite,un po'lontano dal centro, ottimo rapporto qualit√†-prezzo. L'unica pecca,piscina chiusa per restauro durante il mio soggiorno..in ogni caso lo consiglio e ci ritornerei sicuramente!",5,2015,09,15
30,St√§dtereise,"Sehr sch√∂nes Hotel.Etwas abseits der Stadtmitte.ca. 10 Min.vom Flughafen entfernt.  Metro Station auf der anderen Stra√üenseite.11 Stationen und man ist schon in der Stadt. 
Hochmodernes Design im ganzen Hotel. Flugl√§rm oder √§hnliches h√∂rt man im Zimmer nicht. Shuttle Service zum Flughafen und zur Stadtmitte. 
Fr√ºhst√ºck war leider nicht mit inbegriffen, haben es einmal zus√§tzlich bezahlt.  Waren aber f√ºr den Preis nicht begeistert.  In der Stadt kann man an jeder Stra√üenecke gut fr√ºhst√ºcken f√ºr wenig Geld. 
Nichts desto trotz w√ºrden wir dieses Hotel jedesmal wieder buchen",5,2015,09,15
30,Vista spettacolare,Un hotel che ho amato. Il design e l'architettura mi ha conquistata. Anche se non vicino al centro di Barcellona √® ben servito da metro. Ospitalit√† e cordialit√† di alto livello. Ristorante panoramico per cene galanti ed uniche.,5,2015,09,14
30,Bellissiama esperienza,"L'Hotel √® meraviglioso, le stanze grandi e pulitissime e lo staff sempre cordiale e disponibile ( in particolar modi Nicolas ). Se si capita dal sedicesimo piano in poi ( io ero al 17¬∞ ) con vista citt√†, la veduta √® da mozzafiato.
La colazione ottima, abbondante e completa e lo staff di servizio sempre presente e celere nel riempirvi il bicchiere se √® vuoto.
La struttura √® nuova ma √® anche ben tenuta, cosa non facile visto l'imponenza.
La posizione √® abbastanza defilata rispetto al centro citt√† ma molto vicina all'aeroporto. Ma nessun problema in quanto la prima fermata metro si trova realmente a pochi metri dall'Hotel e anche la fermata bus. La fermata metro √® un capolinea della linea rossa ( Hospitalet de Bellvitage ), la line rossa in pochi minuti vi porta ovunque voi vogliate andare. 
Io consiglierei per chi come me ha soggiornato 6 notti di fare il biglietto T10 che vale per 10 timbrature per tutti i mezzi della citta e la timbratura √® valida un ora e 15 minuti anche se cambiate mezzo di trasporto. Io con due biglietti per me e due per mia moglie ho vissuto Barcellona in lungo e in largo senza problemi ( il T10 costa 9.95 E ) quindi io e mia moglie con 40 Euro totali abbiamo utilizzato tutti i mezzi di trasporto che la citt√† ti offre ( metro, tram, bus e treni ). Non conviene fare i biglietti giornalieri o che valgono pi√π giorni.
Vi ricordo per chi legge che dal luned√¨ al venerd√¨ la metro chiude a mezzanotte, ma nessun problema perch√© gli autobus girano h 24. il Sabato e la Domenica la metro chiude alle 2:00 dopo le due ci sono sempre gli autobus che dalla citt√† vi portano proprio d'avanti all'Hotel.
Io sono atterrato all'aeroporto di Girona, appena atterrato mi sono affrettato ad adera al botteghino per fare il biglietto perl'autobus che vi porta alla citt√† di Barcellona per la modica cifra di 25 euro a testa per√≤ andata e ritorno ( vi conviene farlo subito ). Il viaggio dura circa un ora e pochi minuti e vi lascia all Estatio Nord dove vi √® la fermata metro Arc de Tionf che vi porta dove volete. Gli autobus che coprono la tratta Girona Barcellona partono quasi ogni due ore tutti i giorni, ma comunque vi verr√† dato al momento dell'imbarco all'aeroporto un calendario con gli orari. Vi consiglio di scegliere almeno al ritorno non l'ultimo autobus utile al vostro orario ma il precedente perch√© potreste non trovare posto visto che chi prima arriva prima ""alloggia"".
Per finire Barcellona √® incantevole √® unica. Bella tutta e molto da vedere, anche se una volta basta e avanza. Vi consiglio di visitare ovviamente le opere di Gaud√¨, vedendole si capisce perch√© √® stato definito l'architetto di DIO. La Sagrada Familia assolutamente incantevole fuori e mozzafiato dentro ( prendete le audioguide e prenotate il tiket via internet per evitare le infinite code ), il Parc Guell assolutamente fantastico ( vi consiglio di fare una capatina il girono prima per comprare il biglietto per il giorno dopo, vi danno l'orario quindi eviterete di spettare), dopo aver comprato il biglietto visto che siete li vi consiglio di visitare la parte esterna alla zona monumentale perch√© √® con libero accesso.
Una delle cose che mi ha lasciato pi√π impressionato √® la Casa Battl√≤, da fuori non si direbbe, ma il costo del biglietto ( 21 euro ) se lo ripaga tutto quando la visitate all'interno. Fantastica perch√© vi danno un audioguida e una specie di smartphone che vi far√† entrare in un mondo multimediale che vi spiega tutto e vi fa vedere tutto attraverso il display dello smartphone. Incredibile, stanze vuote che prendono vita. Da non perdere.
Ovviamente giro alla Rambla e quartiere Gotico ( state attenti a possibili furtarelli quando c'√® folla ).
La Paeila vi consiglio di mangiarla lungo la Barceloneta ( litorale Barcelonese ).  Buonissima.
Non perdetevi la Boutique della frutta sulla Rambla, da fuori non rende ma entrateci dentro e vi si aprir√† un modo e anche lo stomaco perla fame ( i prezzi sono abbordabili ).
Per ultimo ma nion per bellezza ""la fontana magica "" che nei giorni dal gioved√¨ alla domenica dalle 21.00 danno vita ad uno spettacolo di fontane danzanti coloratissime e suggestive da mantenerti incollato a vederle.
Ovviamente anche il resto √® da vedere , ma quello sopra indicato secondo me √® il top e per visitarlo richiede pi√π tempo.
Comunque esperienza indimenticabile.",5,2015,09,08
30,Fant√°stico ,"Nos alojamos durante cinco d√≠as en este maravilloso hotel y toda la estancia result√≥ perfecta. La decoraci√≥n y limpieza de las habitaciones, el trato del personal, el desayuno buffet espectacular, el restaurante...en definitiva un hotel para repetir.",5,2015,09,07

Las habitaciones son amplias, modernas y con buenas vistas. La comida es de primera.
√önica pega, el precio del gimnasio/piscina me parece algo elevado para los clientes del hotel.",5,2015,09,04
30,Al detalle,"He pasado 4 d√≠as en este hotel por motivos de trabajo y todo es muy positivo.Al estar completo el hotel, me dieron una suite en la planta 25 sin ning√∫n cargo y con todo tipo de comodidades, adem√°s de unas vistas espectaculares de la ciudad condal.El hotel es muy amplio  y luminososo y lo mejor de todo es el personal que siempre esta sonriendo, te tratan de maravilla y se preocupan en todo momento de que no te falte nada y que te sientas como en casa.Detalles min√∫sculos pero que tienen mucha importancia que en muchos hoteles no cuidan como por ejemplo en los desayunos te ofrecen caf√© ""de jarra"" pero si les pides un expreso de maquina......con una sonrisa lo tienes en un minuto, zumo de naranja reci√©n exprimido,etc...... Te hacen empezar el d√≠a de otra manera, o que te ayuden e indiquen que ascensor te viene mejor en cada momento para subir o bajar.....
Tiene centro de convenciones muy bien preparado y un spa y gym muy grande.
Como puntos a mejorar, sugerir√≠a que cobrar√° 14 ‚Ç¨ a los clientes del hotel por usar el gym me parece un abuso.Y tambi√©n que limpien las cristaleras de las √∫ltimas plantas, ya que estando en la cama o en el jacuzzi y tener esas vistas,se desluce mucho con unos ventanales llenos de polvo y suciedad.

Lo recomiendo 100%",4,2015,09,03

Gracias a todo el equipo Tower por un fin de semana tan especial.",5,2015,08,30
30,Non corrisponde all'offerta,"Per prima cosa l'albergo √® molto lontano dal centro; addirittura si trova in un'altro Comune, per la precisione quello di l'hospitalet. Sulla carta sembrava molto pi√π vicino. Poi, causa crisi, su quattro ristoranti disponibili, solo uno era aperto di sera. Con mia moglie volevamo cenare al ristorante panoramico ma ci hanno detto che √® chiuso da tre anni. Il ristorante aperto era molto buono. La palestra e la SPA sono a pagamento e gestite esternamente rispetto all'hotel, cosa singolare per un 5 stelle. Non c'√® un valet parking e nemmeno un parcheggio custodito. In compenso ci hanno offerto un up-grade da favola, mettendoci in una suite duplex al 25' piano da sogno.
Nel complesso non lo consiglio per turismo, forse lo condiglierei per business.",2,2015,08,24

30,Una notte nel futuro,"Alle porte di Barcellona, estremamente comodo come appoggio per visitare il centro citt√† (facilmente raggiungibile in metropolitana) e per l'aereoporto (tariffa taxi minima). A prima vista sembra far parte di una scenografia industriale fantascientifica. Gli interni sono curati, molto minimal-chic. Suggestiva vista dalle camere della citt√† di Barcellona.
Le stanze sono comode e spaziose, curate nei particolari e dotate di tutti i comfort.
Da evitare la colazione se non √® espressamente inclusa nel prezzo della stanza, perch√® il costo √® molto elevato. Il buffet della colazione √® comunque molto abbondante, e offre un giro del mondo culinario apprezzabile.",4,2015,08,13

Si vas en coche se puede aparcar en las proximidades del hotel sin mucha dificultad.
El desayuno result√≥ muy completo, no ech√© en falta nada importante, y los camareros fueron muy amables, atentos y con ganas de agradar.

30,Hotel am Ende der Welt,"Hotel: Businesshotel in der N√§he eines Krankenhauses, das w√§hrend unseres Aufenthaltes vorwiegend von franz√∂sischen G√§sten bewohnt war. Die G√§stekultur war sehr angenehm und wir trafen vorwiegend freundliche und nette Menschen. Das Hotel selbst ist ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen, was man bereits an der Hotellobby und der Rezeption merkt. Reparaturen werden zwar durchgef√ºhrt, aber nur leidlich. Zum Lieferumfang unseres Angebots geh√∂rte Wi-Fi. Das Signal war gut und die Geschwindigkeit akzeptabel.

Lage: Die Lage des Hotels ist nicht die Beste. Es liegt am Stadtrand an der letzten Metro-Station, direkt neben einem Krankenhaus. Die direkte Nachbarschaft stellen eine Tankstelle und ein Elektronikmarkt dar. Interessante Orte gibt es nicht. Besonders hervorzuheben ist allerdings der Shuttle-Service in die Innenstadt, zum Flughafen und zum Strand. Je nach Anzahl der Personen sei es aber angebracht schon eine Weile vor der Abfahrt an der Abholstelle zu stehen, da nur 8 Personen mitgenommen werden k√∂nnen. Mit der Metro ist es aber kein Problem binnen 30 Minuten in die Innenstadt zu kommen. Andere Destinationen k√∂nnen auch mit einem Bus angefahren werden, der direkt in der N√§he des Hotels h√§lt.

Service: Das Service war freundlich, aber uninspiriert. Zus√§tzliche W√ºnsche wurden zwar angenommen, aber nicht erf√ºllt. Auf Beschwerden wurde nicht eingegangen. Erw√§hnenswert ist auch, dass wir keinen Mitarbeiter mit deutschen Sprachkenntnissen gesehen haben ‚Äì die beherrschten Sprachen erkennt man am Schild. W√§hrend des Fr√ºhst√ºcks gibt es einen Tisch-Service, der Kaffee und Orangensaft nachschenkt. Die Reaktionszeiten waren dabei unterschiedlich. Meistens musste man sich aber bemerkbar machen, damit man bedient wird. An der Zimmerreinigung gibt es dagegen keinerlei Beanstandungen. Unser Zimmer wurde stets sauber gehalten.

Restaurants: Das Hotel verf√ºgt √ºber mehrere Restaurants, die wird aber nicht in Anspruch genommen haben, da wir nur zum Fr√ºhst√ºck im Hotel verweilten. Die Qualit√§t der Speisen war eines 5-Sterne Hotels angemessen, wobei sie aber im unteren Bereich rangiert. Die Auswahl war dagegen relativ begrenzt und die mit abstand kleinste von allen von uns besuchten 5-Sterne Hotels. So gab es weder einen Koch, der frische Speisen zubereitete noch zus√§tzliche Goodies, die man aus anderen 5-Sterne Hotels kennt. Die R√ºhreier waren matschig. Die Pfannkuchen (Pancake) trocken. Die Auswahl der S√§fte oder Joghurts war begrenzt und teils eine Stunde vor dem Ende gab es schon etliche Speisen nicht mehr. Im Ganzen also, eine eher uninspirierte Fr√ºhst√ºcksk√ºche, die man essen kann, aber von der man nicht schw√§rmen wird.

Zimmer: Ger√§umige Zimmer, an denen zwar der Zahn der Zeit nagt, die aber durchaus dem Standard eines 5-Sterne-Hotels entsprechen. Die Standardzimmer verf√ºgen √ºber eine Minibar, einen Schreibtisch mit Stuhl und eine Couch. Das angebliche ¬ªBockspring-Kingsize-Bett¬´ waren in Wirklichkeit zwei auf Rollen stehende Gestellte, die nicht gegeneinander arretiert waren und auf denen zwei Matratzen drapiert wurden. Hat man sich mit dem R√ºcken gegen die Wand beim Lesen gelehnt oder legte sich direkt in die Mitte, rutschten die Gestellte auseinander ‚Äì den Rollen sei Dank. Das Badezimmer ist voll verspiegelt und durchaus ansprechend anzusehen ‚Äì auch wenn man auch hier etliche Defekte, wie beispielsweise undichte W√§nde, beobachten kann. Leider verf√ºgt das Zimmer weder √ºber Badelatschen noch √ºber einen Bademantel ‚Äì was laut Aussage der Rezeption auch beabsichtigt ist. Begr√º√üungsgetr√§nk, wie Wasser, gab es ebenfalls nicht. Die Preise der Minibar sind dagegen gesalzen, was uns gerade bei der Anreise und der fehlenden Erfrischungsm√∂glichkeit extrem √§rgerte.

Fazit: Hesperia Tower ist zwar ein ordentliches Hotel, das allerdings nur mit M√ºhe seine 5-Sterne verdient. Die Entfernung zum Stadtzentrum und anderen Attraktionen macht es unserer Meinung nach schwer das Hotel f√ºr eine Stadttour in Barcelona zu empfehlen. Unser Tipp ist deshalb sich eher ein gutes 4-Sterne-Hotel in der N√§he des Stadtzentrums zu holen. Die Vorteile von Hesperia Tower (sofern es welche gibt) rechtfertigen nicht die lange Anfahrtszeit von teils √ºber einer Stunde per Metro, Shuttle oder Taxi. Der Service des Hotels verdient es erst recht nicht, dass man die M√ºhen einer langen Anfahrt auf sich nimmt -  Das Hotel ist schlicht ein Ort, an dem man √ºbernachten kann, aber nicht unbedingt muss.",3,2015,07,22

30,Buen hotel restaurante,"Buen hotel restaurante, alejado de la ciudad de Barcelona pero buena elecci√≥n si haces un viaje corto porque queda cerca (en coche) del aeropuerto.

30,Trato Excelente,"Atenci√≥n: No es el restaurante de la c√∫pula ya que est√° cerrado, si no el restaurante que est√° situado al primer o segundo piso. El trato es excelente, la comida muy correcta y el ambiente relajante...

30,ESTANCIA HOTEL,"Un hotel formidable, y lo es por varias razones. Fue inaugurado hace pocos a√±os, lo cual hace que tenga unas instalaciones confortables, modernas y con unos acabados excelentes. La calidad del servicio, muy buena, atenta y amable en todo momento. Muy recomendable para cualquier tipo de viaje.",5,2015,06,02
30,Lujo con may√∫sculas,"Hotel incre√≠ble y muy moderno. Vale la pena verlo iluminado por dentro por la noche. El trato excelente. Lo recomiendo cien por cien. El restaurante del hotel (el del servicio de habitaciones) tiene un planto de ""lechona"" que es buen√≠simo. Las dos ocasiones que he ido a este hotel he pedido este plato. Vale la pena.",5,2015,05,30
30,"Moderno , Bonito, C√≥modo, Buen Desayuno","Quiz√°s esperaba algo mas por las estrellas que tiene, no ofrecieron carta de almohadas ni me ayudaron con las maletas,  pero es un buen hotel,muy buena atenci√≥n en recepci√≥n, grande, espacioso, bonito,habitaciones grandes, confortables, sencillas, b√°sicas completas y limpias, tienen albornoz y zapatillas secador y productos aseo b√°sico cepillo dientes etc.. y  . las vistas son espectaculares desde las habitaciones con grandes ventanales ,el  desayuno muy bueno, quiz√°s repetitivo si te alojas varias semanas, es todos los d√≠as lo mismo pero gran cantidad de todo, bien atendido y servido, zumos naturales de varias clases en cantidad, t√© de mil sabores con sus tazas especiales, lo peor el caf√© que van sirviendo por las mesas, vomitivo , pero disponen de expresos,, quitando peque√±as cosas muy, muy, bueno todo.En general lo recomiendo todo
Lo que peor me sienta y no sobre el hotel, es que Catalu√±a te cobre tasas tur√≠sticas  a los espa√±oles por ir a pasar vacaciones all√≠, vamos que les cobren a los extranjeros....  eso a mi me da igual, pero a los nativos, es muy fuerte,,, Yo por que fui por temas de trabajo ,y no pagaba yo, pero vamos visto lo visto que no me esperen que yo veranee en Catalu√±a si va a ser as√≠, por que ojo que el precio por d√≠a se nota en el bolsillo si te quedas unas semanas",4,2015,05,23
30,Increible,"El mejor hotel de Espa√±a en el que me he hospedado.. planta 25 vistas √∫nicas jacuzzi,  aun estoy impresionado. Espero repetir pronto.  El personal encantador y la habitaci√≥n muy limpia. El club tower muy adecuado para todas las horas del d√≠a  y con mucha calidad",5,2015,05,20
30,Sehr sch√∂nes Hotel mit guter Anbindung in die City,"Das Hotel liegt an der L1. Es ist zwar die Endstation aber die Z√ºge fahren alle 3 Minuten und so ist man in 20 Minuten an allen wichtigen Orten der Stadt. Wir waren von der Sauberkeit, dem Comfort und dem Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet begeistert. Einfach nur empfehlenswert. ",5,2015,05,17
30,"""Un hotel con vistas""","Hotel con una impresionante arquitectura, decoraci√≥n exquisita. Las habitaciones muy amplias y confortables, con unas magn√≠ficas vistas.

30,PRECIOSO Y TRANQUILO,"Un hotel con habitaciones preciosas. y vistas increibles!
Lo √∫nico que fue de  risa es saber llamar al ascensor!!!!!
Subimos y bajamos como 6 veces.. demasiada tecnolog√≠a para nosotros!!!
jajajjajajaja....a pesar de todo .....fue muy divertido!
Recomiendo el Hotel 100x100",5,2015,05,12
30,Boda para recordar...,"Mi mujer y yo tuvimos la oportunidad de DISFRUTAR del Hesperia Tower con motivo de la celebraci√≥n en el hotel de la boda de Yoya & Jos√© Mar√≠a: ¬°Vaya Boda! ¬°Para recordar!.
Hicimos uso del transfer desde el aeropuerto al hotel. Al llegar al hotel todo fueron facilidades para ayudarnos (planchado de ropa, indicaciones eficientes, etc...). La habitaci√≥n a la altura de las expectativas, camas grandes, buenas toallas y muy limpia. Por supuesto, Wifi gratuito a muy buena velocidad...
El desayuno ten√≠a la variedad y calidad suficiente como para ponerte en duda de qu√© comer. La ceremonia fue en el mismo hotel. Sencillamente SUBLIME. Todo perfectamente organizado. Al finalizar la celebraci√≥n nos llevar√≥n al restaurante EVO para el banquete: no hay palabras que describan la sensaci√≥n de verte en ese precioso restaurante con las magn√≠ficas vistas de Barcelona. All√≠ banquete, baile, barra libre... ¬°qu√© bonito todo!. 
En resumen, un 10 para todos los que componen el equipo del HESPERIA TOWER, ¬°amenazamos con VOLVER!
Saludos.",5,2015,05,11
30,Design e qualit√† a prezzi ragionevoli,"Parto subito da due piccole osservazioni: l'aria condizionata unico sistema di ventilazione silenziosa ma pur sempre avvertibile e la distanza dal centro ma facilmente raggiungibile in metro in 20-25 minuti.
Per il resto tutto a 5 stelle: design dell'albergo, ampiezza delle camere, pulizia, cortesia del personale, wi fi veloce e colazione ben assortita.
Approfittando dell'offerta di un tour operator on line abbiamo ottenuto un'ottimo rapporto qualit√†/prezzo per una camera superior al 17¬∞ piano con vista magnifica sulla citt√†.",5,2015,05,08
30,Un 10 para el personal del restaurante Bouquet,"Llegue 30 minutos antes de cerrar. Atendieron r√°pido, profesional, la comida, un tartar de at√∫n riqu√≠simo, listo en tiempo record y el postre todav√≠a mejor, flan de queso de cabra. Cerveza bien fr√≠a y cuidado al detalle. Una hora despu√©s de aterrizar estaba en la habitaci√≥n bien cenado y con una sonrisa en la cara, listo para descansar.
Gracias!!",5,2015,05,08
30,Una boda con encanto,"Asisti a una boda en el Hesperia Tower. ESPECTACULAR! La ceremonia se celebro en el propio hotel. Todo estaba al minimo detalle... despues la cena se realizo en el restaurante Evo. IMPRESIONANTE... solo con las vistas de la ciudad y la belleza de lugar nos quedamos sin respiracion. La cena fue un lujo y quiero destacar la amabilidad de todo el personal. La cena fue amenizada por dos cantantes de opera. Que maravilla, que sutil, que elegante... y la fiesta  continuo. Las habitaciones muy elegantes, sobrias y comodas. Destacar la amabilidad de Xavier en recepcion. Nos recomendo un buen restaurante japones en barcelona. Incluso nos tramito el la reserva.Muy atento,servicial y profesional. Felicidades hesperia tower team!!!!",5,2015,05,05
30,Ha sido la mejor estancia en un hotel,"La habitaci√≥n donde me aloje era muy espaciosa con unas vistas espectaculares. La distribuci√≥n de la suite duplex era perfecta, dispon√≠a de un jacuzzi en el dormitorio con vistas a Barcelona. Los peque√±os detalles como la decoraci√≥n con flores y bombones hizo que mi estancia fuese muy confortable. Seguramente repetir√©.",5,2015,04,27
30,Extraordinario en todos los aspectos,"Lo primero que llama la atenci√≥n al llegar al hotel es el edificio espectacular tanto por su altura como por su singularidad, que no pasa desapercibido en su entorno. La habitaci√≥n excelente y muy confortable en la planta 25, unas vistas impresionantes. El desayuno en bufet libre con una amplia franja horaria, la variedad y calidad es espectacular. Por cierto, si busc√°is restaurantes no hace falta buscar muy lejos en el propio hotel ten√©is el restaurante Boquet que esta justo encima de recepci√≥n, se come excelente. Por ultimo quisiera dar las gracias al personal del hotel, por su amabilidad y cordialidad ¬°saludos cordiales y hasta pronto!",5,2015,04,27
30,Excelente elecci√≥n,"Una experiencia que recomendaria,la habitacion duplex es muy espaciosa a la vez de poder disfrutar de unas vistas sobre la ciudad o el parque de Garraf impresionantes,  la limpieza de la habitacion, i la excelente atencion de sus camareras,personal de reccepci√≥n,resturantes es digna de menci√≥n.  Disfrutamos de una cena en uno de los restaurantes del hotel buquet su cocina es excelente al igual que el trato  amable y profesional de sus camareros, maitre, sin duda lo recomendare para cena de pareja o amigos",5,2015,04,27
30,5 stelle!,Veramente uno spettacolo di hotel. Soprattutto per le suite ai piani alti che danno la possibilit√† di godere di un meraviglioso panorama della citt√†. Personale molto disponibile e cortese soprattutto Nicolas un ragazzo molto professionale e all' altezza di quest'hotel. Unica pecca √® la distanza dal centro anche se con i servizi messi a disposizione dalla struttura in 20min si √® nel cuore della citt√†.,5,2015,04,26
30,Muy buen hotel,"Estuvimos una noche, la habitaci√≥n grande, limpia, c√≥moda y muy completa. Tenia una ducha con hidromasaje. La vista a la ciudad muy bella. El servicio de la recepci√≥n muy bueno. Esta cerca al aeropuerto y cuenta con free shuttle. De lo mejor en Barcelona. Lo recomiendo.",5,2015,04,23
30,Buon rapporto qualit√† prezzo,"Intendiamoci: nulla di indimenticabile ! Purtuttavia l'enorme struttura, soprattutto all'interno, conserva il suo fascino di hotel di design, anche se la necessit√† di un restyling e di migliore manutenzione appaiono evidenti soprattutto nelle pur piacevoli stanze panoramiche. Un esercito di piacevoli e cortesissimi giovanotti e giovanotte alla reception rende gradevole l'arrivo in hotel, anche se qualche volta, di fronte a certe domande, danno idea di non conoscere pienamente n√® la struttura n√® la zona dove l'hotel √® collocato ! Purtroppo il ristorante panoramico dell'ultimo piano non funziona da tre anni mentre alla palestra collegata all'hotel si accede solo a pagamento: entrambe circostanze che non risultano sufficientemente chiare dal sito dell'hotel e dal sito di  ""Booking"". Peccato, anche perch√®, soprattutto il ristorante aveva giocato un ruolo di primo piano nella scelta della struttura ... In ogni caso l'ottimo servizio e il conveniente prezzo del ristorante Bouquet, interno all'hotel, assieme al prezzo della stanza appaiono assolutamente concorrenziali, tenuto conto che seppure lontani, si arriva al  centro di Barcellona in venti minuti con la metro L1 e si soggiorna in un albergo 5 stelle ( magari un p√≤ generosamente attribuite ! ).",4,2015,04,16
30,Grata Experiencia,"Es la primera vez que me he alojado en este hotel, y la verdad ha resultado ser una experiencia muy agradable. El hotel es excelente en todos los niveles, y la habitaci√≥n en la que me aloj√© ha sido excepcional.
Soy cliente NH Platinum, pero es grato descubrir que siempre me pueden sorprender gratamente.",5,2015,04,16
30,F√ºr den Preis okay!,"Ein schickes und modernes Hotel, welches f√ºr den Preis sicherlich nur schwierig zu finden ist. Der Service der Mitarbeiter war gut, der Ausblick aus dem 15. Stock toll. 
Abz√ºge gibt es bei den extrem teuren Getr√§nken (7 Euro f√ºr ein kleines Bier in der Minibar) und die verkehrsung√ºnstige Lage (Ca. 30 Minuten Bahnfahrt in die Innenstadt).

Alles in Allem in Ordnung.",3,2015,04,13
30,Excelente menos por  alg√∫n trabajador en concreto,"El encargado de recepci√≥n Roger se comporto de manera excelente , y otros  compa√±eros tambi√©n  , pero quiero hacer una menci√≥n especial a este  trabajador.  Hubo una persona en la recepci√≥n en concreto que no me hizo sentir tan c√≥modo y no por los gestos si no por sus acciones , pero  fue el punto negro del lado blanco de  YIn Yang  ( y NO  estaba en practicas precisamente )  pero no  voy a dar m√°s datos ya que puedo equivocarme y aunque estuviera seguro , tampoco lo har√≠a . Un gran recuerdo y  "" Hesperio ""  volver pronto .  ! Muchisimas gracias ¬°

Nos recibieron con una sonrisa todo en este hotel es impecable.
Lo que m√°s nos gust√≥ fue el restaurante, celebramos all√≠ el cumple y la comida es exquisita pero el servicio es acorde a la categor√≠a del hotel. Nos atendieron tan bien que repetimos la noche siguiente, conocimos dos maitres y ambos demostraron mucha profesionalidad maridando los vinos con nuestros platos adem√°s tanto Nacho como Daniela fueron muy atentos con nosotros.
En resumen un hotel genial, hasta el ch√≥fer que te acerca al centro nos caus√≥ buena impresi√≥n.

Tarifa: 

A medio camino entre el aeropuerto y la ciudad, rodeado de dos hospitales gigantescos, de las rondas de acceso a la ciudad y de algunas zonas a√∫n no urbanizadas, Hesperia gestiona como hotel una gigantesca torre que se ha convertido casi en una se√±a de identidad m√°s de la Ciudad Condal. Un edificio exento, estilizado, con 21 plantas jalonadas de ventanas, acero y cristal, recorrido en su lateral por ascensores panor√°micos y rematado con una peculiar c√∫pula que en su momento alberg√≥ uno de los restaurantes del malogrado Santi Santamar√≠a. 

Un puentecito cubierto con un tejadillo sobre una fuente nos conduce a la recepci√≥n tras atravesar una gran puerta autom√°tica de cristal. El espacio es imponente: Los contrafuertes rojos del edificio asetean la zona creando espacios para la cafeter√≠a, el bar, la recepci√≥n, la zona de ascensores. Todo, techo incluido, en cristal, lo que aumenta la sensaci√≥n de luminosidad y contrasta con el m√°rmol negro brillant√≠simo del suelo. 

El largo mostrador de recepci√≥n queda a nuestra izquierda. Cinco personas se disponen a atendernos con una sonrisa. El procedimiento es igual de lento y burocr√°tico de siempre. pero al menos con una sonrisa. 

A la derecha encontramos la zona de los ascensores. Igualmente amplia y luminosa. Un par de totems nos invitan a indicar en una pantalla a qu√© piso queremos subir. Y la misma pantalla nos devuelve el ascensor que hemos de coger. Enormes, con cristal al exterior, enmoquetados y que escalan r√°pida y silenciosamente hasta la planta de nuestra habitaci√≥n. Al salir del ascensor se repite el m√°rmol negro en el suelo. Las ventanas que dan a la escalera de incendios iluminan naturalmente el espacio ofreciendo vistas hacia el centro de la ciudad.

Desde ese recibidor, un pasillo enmoquetado en color marr√≥n claro con paredes en el mismo color alternado con la madera rojiza de puertas y marcos nos conduce hacia las habitaciones. El n√∫mero de la habitaci√≥n aparece en un cartel de metacrilato con el logotipo del hotel (su figura estilizada) junto a las puertas, y con un interruptor plateado para el timbre. 

 Tras la pesada puerta volvemos al m√°rmol negro en suelo y paredes. Abrimos la puerta directamente sobre el ba√±o en este caso convertido en un brillante espacio negro, fenomenalmente iluminado, que acoge un enorme espejo bajo el que se presentan dos lavabos con grifer√≠a moderna incrustados en una poderosa encimera de m√°rmol negro y sobre un armario en el mismo color rojizo de la puerta. Frente al lavabo un vestidor que ofrece distintos tipos de colgantes (largos, cortos), cajones, armaritos, una caja fuerte y un espejo de cuerpo entero que hace las veces de puerta corredera. A la izquierda del todo dos puertas de cristal oscuro con el interior iluminado presentan el inodoro y una fenomenal cabina de ducha. 

A continuaci√≥n del ba√±o, una puerta de cristal nos comunica con el dormitorio. La moqueta marr√≥n clara vuelve al suelo. Paredes en ocre, cama blanca rematada con un elegante cabecero en piel. Un largu√≠simo escritorio, con cajonera, alberga el minibar en un lado y una serie de snacks en el otro. Enchufes para trabajar con el wifi gratuito y veloz que se ofrece y una c√≥moda silla en la misma piel del cabecero. Delante, colgando de la pared un enorme plasma y en un rinc√≥n de la mesa una radio digital que sirve como cargador de algunos m√≥viles. 

Delante de la ventana hay un bonito y c√≥modo sof√° en terciopelo morado que contrasta con el resto de la habitaci√≥n y le da un toque elegante. Limp√≠simo. A su lado una mesa de centro baja y un armario con estanter√≠as donde se ofrecen revistas, algunos folletos e informaci√≥n sobre el hotel. Y justo detr√°s toda la pared de cristal con impresionantes vistas hasta el mar. 

La cama es deliciosa. Sus s√°banas blancas, con un agradable dibujo de cuadritos, son frescas y envolventes. La manta y la colcha ligeras. Las almohadas comod√≠simas. Junto a la cama dos mesillas grandes, en el color marr√≥n rojizo que ya es costumbre en el hotel sostienen dos enormes l√°mparas de noche que dan suficiente luz para la lectura tras sus pantallas moradas. Enchufes para los aparatos el√©ctricos y un mont√≥n de interruptores que nos permiten jugar con distintos formatos de luz, incluido el apagado total. Dos interruptores m√°s permiten correr de forma un poco ""brusca"" las cortinas del enorme ventanal. El sol de la ciudad puede con el foscurit y por la ma√±ana entra algo de luz en la estancia por los extremos de la ventana. 

La insonorizaci√≥n exterior es brutal, as√≠ como la interior. No se escucha nada del pasillo ni de las habitaciones contiguas. Nada. Por esta parte, y por la comodidad de la cama el descanso est√° garantizado. 

S√≥lo un pero a la habitaci√≥n: no hay un espacio para dejar la maleta abierta. El cl√°sico maletero, lo que nos obliga a deshacer toda la maleta en el armario (hay espacio y perchas de sobra) y dejarla recogida dentro del armario en una zona habilitada para ello. 

 En el ba√±o las instalaciones funcionan a la perfecci√≥n. El espejo est√° bien iluminado, aunque tambi√©n se ofrece un espejo de aumento retroiluminado. Quiz√° el surtido de amenities sea un poco escaso: gel, champ√∫, acondicionador, crema hidratante y pastilla de jab√≥n. Adem√°s en el armario hay un lustrazapatos de NH con el logo antiguo. Por separado el inodoro. Y junto a √©l tras otra puerta una enorme cabina de ducha en la que contin√∫a el m√°rmol negro. C√°lidamente iluminada en su interior alberga una columna de hidromasaje. Chorritos por todo el cuerpo, una ducha de tel√©fono y arriba una enorme alcachofa de efecto lluvia. La temperatura es envidiable pero le falta un puntito de caudal y de presi√≥n.

El equipo de lencer√≠a es apabullante, todo ello bordado con el logotipo del hotel. Nuevo, limpio, de grandes dimensiones: dos albornoces, dos toallas de lavabo y dos de ba√±o, adem√°s de una enorme alfombrilla doble que puede ocupar toda la zona de lavabos.

El desayuno en la ma√±ana es contundente. Pocas cosas hay que podamos echar en falta. Platos fr√≠os y calientes, fiambres, embutidos, quesos, verduras, ensaladas, fruta cortada, varios tipos de mermelada, croisants crujientes reci√©n hechos, varios tipos de pan, gelatinas, flanes y postres l√°cteos, tartas y pasteles, tortitas, siropes... Adem√°s todo ello atendido por un equipo de amables camareras que sirven directamente una y otra vez el zumo de naranja natural y los caf√©s que se soliciten.

En la despedida, frente al mostrador todo tipo de preguntas sobre nuestro descanso: el ruido, la cama, la luz, el ba√±o, el sue√±o... Llega incluso a sorprender por lo inusual. Luego factura, inter√©s por nuestro viaje y despedida. Impresionante.

30,Muy mal trato de la recepci√≥n,"Mala informaci√≥n, ningun detalle, mal servicio.Si se contrata un apartamento del Hesperia Fira Suites, no existe ning√∫n servicio en ese edificio ni nadie en recepci√≥n que esta cerrado, el cliente debe uno mismo con un autom√°tico abrirse √©l mismo la puerta.  Adem√°s debo decir que resulta muy incomodo llegar al hotel y desplazarse desde ali a Barcelona o a la Feria de Barcelona que estando relativamente cerca es muy intrincado el itinerario.",1,2015,03,26

30,Quando la qualit√† supera il design,"Mantenere attuali le strutture dal design moderno √® impresa ardua: ci√≤ che oggi √® considerato avveniristico, dopo pochi anni rischia infatti di passare d√©mod√©. L'Hesperia Tower √® una struttura che, a prima vista, potrebbe portare ad una simile considerazione. Ma una volta superato il banco del check-in e raggiunta la camera, tutto parr√† pi√π chiaro. Le sistemazioni vantano una metratura molto generosa ed arredi dallo stile contemporaneo, elegante e molto accogliente. Letti, materassi e biancheria da letto promettono fin dal primo sguardo lunghe notti di sonno ristoratore e la spettacolare vista sulla citt√† che si pu√≤ ammirare dagli ampi vetri a tutta altezza, render√† l'ambiente molto piacevole e dall'essenza cosmopolita.
Il consiglio per√≤ √® quello di non fermarsi alla stanza ma quello di provare anche il ristorante Bouquet, dove mangerete al di sopra di ogni pi√π rosea aspettativa e a prezzi decisamente contenuti per la media di Barcellona e in rapporto alla qualit√† dei piatti serviti. Cordialit√†, attenzione e cortesia faranno da contorno ad un'ottima paella, ad un freschissimo antipasto ed ancora ad uno squisito dessert.

La ubicaci√≥n tambi√©n est√° bien ya que esta "" a las afueras"" pero a la vez muy cerca del centro de Barcelona.
La habitaci√≥n era muy amplia y lujosa y con unas vistas perfectas de toda la ciudad.
El desayuno era muy variado y de gran calidad.
Lo √∫nico que eche de menos de un hotel de estas caracter√≠sticas, fue que no ten√≠a piscina... (Solo dispone de una cubierta con spa en local anexo que es un gimnasio).
La atenci√≥n del personal perfecta. Todos muy amables y serviciales.

30,Muy bueno,"Uno de los mejores hoteles en los que he estado.
Calidad, confort, buffet en el desayuno todo riquisimo,personal incre√≠ble... 
Puedo decir que me dieron una habitaci√≥n grandisima, con todo lujo de detalles,unas vistas de Barcelona excelentes justo enfrente de la cama, y que cama!!! La cama mas c√≥moda que he dormido nunca!! 
Simplemente me encant√≥, volver√≠a y lo recomiendo a todos!! 
",5,2015,02,21
30,Relaci√≥n calidad/precio muy bueno si no coges desayuno,"El hotel esta muy bien, el personal muy atento y la limpieza muy bien, la ubicaci√≥n no es muy buena, pero creo que tienen un servicio gratuito para llevarte al centro de la ciudad o al aeropuerto. 
o √∫nico es que el desayuno bufet es muy caro, creo que si lo pusieran a un precio m√°s normal ganar√≠an mas.",4,2015,02,19
30,Lontano dal centro ma indimenticabile!!!!,"Non √® solo un hotel, √® un esperienza visiva suggestiva!!! Eccezionale il gioco di  luci, acqua, pilastri in ferro e vetri nella sala a piano terra, immensa e con un arredamento sorprendente, tanto da sembrare un'istallazione di arte moderna. Magica e romantica  l'atmosfera del ristorante dove si cena sotto una pioggia di stelle cadenti azzurre!!! Eccellenti le stanze con un anticamera interamente rivestita di specchi e una parete a vetri x godere di un panorama indimenticabile!!! Colazione tra le migliori che abbia mai fatto!!! Difetti?? Non esistono finestre e nella mia camera (camera fumatori richiesta alla prenotazione) fumo e vapore della doccia non andavano mai via con la conseguenza terribile che a fine vacanza tutti i miei abiti avevano l'odore di un posacenere!!!!",5,2015,02,03
30,Un excelente y moderno hotel,"Reuni√≥n de trabajo, las instalaciones son excelentes. Habitaciones amplias y cuidadas. Los desayunes buenos, el bufet del almuerzo podr√≠a mejorar algo. La atenci√≥n del personal muy buena. Si hay un pero, es lo retirado que est√° del centro.",4,2015,01,20
30,Vicino solo all'aeroporto e adeguatamente lussuoso,"Ingolositi da un'offerta, abbiamo prenotato qui per 5 notti. Distante pochissimi minuti dall'aeroporto, questo hotel 5 stelle ha ben 26 piani e la nostra camera era al 22esimo, con una bella vista sulla citt√† specialmente di notte. La hall e gli spazi in generale sono curati e arredati con begli oggetti di design. Aria condizionata, doccia con idromassaggio e letti king size con tv e dock per iphone. Sulla colazione e cena non posso esprimermi dal momento che non abbiamo sfruttato questi servizi. Molto ma molto lontano dal centro, almeno 35/40 minuti di metro per raggiungere piazza Catalunya, in pi√π a noi si √® aggiunto l'inconveniente che le ultime fermate di metro verso la periferia erano in manutenzione quindi ogni viaggio dovevamo prendere una navetta sostitutiva per 3 fermate (!!!!!!!)
In effetti avremmo dovuto valutare altri hotel pi√π centrali e/o vicini a Barceloneta, perch√® la distanza dell'hotel dal centro √® la cosa pi√π influente soprattutto in un viaggio di 1 settimana e questo hotel non √® proprio adatto a chi vuole visitare Barcellona..un p√≤ deluso",3,2015,01,18
30,"Perfecto, excepto la ubicaci√≥n","Fant√°stico hotel, pero a las afueras de Barcelona. Habitaciones muy c√≥modas, con un ba√±o magnifico, bonito, y personal amable. Cerca del aeropuerto, pero lejos, del centro de la ciudad, por eso no le doy la m√°xima puntuaci√≥n.",4,2015,01,17
30,Buen hotel pero no tiene bid√©,"Funcional y confortable. Una habitaci√≥n amplia y bien amueblada, un aseo con vestidor pr√°ctico y bien dise√±ado, buena insonorizaci√≥n y un magn√≠fico buf√© de desayuno.  Un pero es sin embargo que no cuenta con bid√©. No deber√≠a pasar esto! Una tendencia que no me gusta nada.",4,2015,01,17
30,EXCELENTE,"No le doy los 5 puntos de m√°xima calificaci√≥n por la ubicaci√≥n del hotel, si estuviera mas c√©ntrico seria el mejor hotel de los que conozco en la ciudad. La habitaci√≥n es fant√°stica, no solamente por lo espacioso y la maravillosa cama, la c√°lida decoraci√≥n ayuda a que te despiertes como en tu casa. Empleados y bufett fant√°sticos. ",4,2015,01,17
30,"Buen hotel, buenos detalles.","Nos ha gustado mucho, buena habitaci√≥n, amplio ba√±o, con ducha amplia, en planta 16, muy buen desayuno buffet, aunque lo pagas, pedimos vistas a Barcelona, ya que despertarte y ver solo el hospital de Bellvitge delante, no es que sea una gran visi√≥n, lo peor, ubicaci√≥n, si no llevas coche, est√° apartado del centro y para dar un paseo, no es una zona muy vistosa, te obliga al taxi o transporte publico. 
Lo mejor, buenos detalles, prensa, atenci√≥n, aparcamiento f√°cil y gratis al lado del hotel, habitaciones silenciosas y amplias, hotel limpio y moderno",4,2015,01,09
30,Excelente hotel y magnifico personal,"En la cena de fin de a√±o nos lo pasamos muy bien y en el evo convertido en discoteca tambien fue estupendo con sus maravillosas vistas de la ciudad
despues en la habitacion fue maravilloso es muy bonita y muy limpia la relaci√≥n calidad precio esta muy bien. esperamos poder repetir pronto.",5,2015,01,09
30,un tocco di modernit√†,"sicuramente un Hotel a livello della moderna Barcellona
ottimo - interessante e bello

peccato veramente peccato per le persone che viaggiano per affarti che lo shuttle service da Apt √® veramente non comparabile con la strutture.....orari fissi e pochissime corse.......",4,2015,01,08
30,Excelente,"Muchas veces he ido,  y nuevamente salgo contento de el,  as√≠ da gusto estar fuera de casa,  porque me siento como en ella ‚ò∫‚ò∫,  es muy tranquilo y ante todo el servicio es excelente volver√© a repetir nuevamente.",5,2015,01,08
30,Perfetto! ,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel 3 notti, nel periodo natalizio. 
Bellissima struttura, accoglienza cordiale e super efficiente. 
Ottima colazione! Ogni mattina tantissima scelta di dolci, frutta, piatto salati..  Insomma, un vero e proprio paradiso! 
Anche se posizionato fuori dal centro di Barcellona, grazie alla linea1 della metro, in 20 minuti si √® in Placa Catalunya. 
Buoni collegamenti con l'aeroporto grazie al bus n. 46.",5,2015,01,07
30,Decepci√≥n tras decepci√≥n.,"No es un 5 estrellas, ni por asomo, he estado en hoteles de 3 y 4 estrellas con las mismas o m√°s comodidades y con much√≠sima mejor relaci√≥n calidad-precio.

Empecemos por el principio, reservamos para la noche de fin de a√±o, para ir despu√©s de las uvas, ya en el momento de la reserva pedimos que ya que llegar√≠amos tarde y era una fecha especial, si se nos permitir√≠a abandonar la habitaci√≥n mas tarde y nos dijeron que s√≠ pero que de todas formas lo volvi√©semos a pedir en la recepci√≥n una vez lleg√°semos, pues as√≠ lo hicimos: la chica de recepci√≥n nos dice que ya que hemos reservado una SUITE, tenemos salida a las 17:00H y el desayuno incluido...  a los dos minutos nos dice que lo siente pero que se ha equivocado, que tenemos que salir a las 14:00h... no nos dice nada m√°s sobre el desayuno. Subimos a la habitaci√≥n y tachan!!! Huele que apesta!!! un olor a cerrado y a no se que m√°s pero que no nos gust√≥ nada... en fin empezamos a mirar la habitaci√≥n que la verdad es muy bonita, me siento en la cama, apoyo un pie en el jacuzzi y se me cae un trozo enorme de yeso!! Est√° que se desmonta por debajo, en fin...  Abrimos el minibar y hab√≠an chapas y basura sin recoger!!!

Hac√≠a fr√≠o en la habitaci√≥n, llamamos para preguntar c√≥mo funcionaba el aire y nadie sab√≠a que decirnos, hasta que a las 2 de la ma√±ana nos preguntan que si queremos que suba un t√©cnico a mirar, pues la verdad que a esas horas no est√°bamos para que subiese nadie... otra m√°s...

Las paredes de papel, est√°bamos por la ma√±ana tan tranquilos y tenemos que o√≠r los gemidos de las habitaciones de alrededor cada media hora, asqueroso!!!!

Hora del desayuno, bajamos a la sala y nos dicen que NO LO TENEMOS INCLUIDO! que nos vayamos a la planta 5 que hay otro tipo de desayuno m√°s b√°sico... bajamos y est√° cerrado! Volvemos a subir y nos dicen que abren a las 8:00, pues son ya las 8:30...

En fin un verdadero desastre, estamos muy decepcionados con este hotel y no pensamos volver m√°s!",1,2015,01,07
30,Experiencia altamente positiva,Ha sido una excelente estancia desde el 31 fin de a√±o y los dias 1 y 2 de enero. Un plan rom√°ntico para parejas. Habitaci√≥n muy acogedora y muy amplia con todos los detalles. Jacutzi en ba√±era y una grandiosa ducha. Os encantar√°. Su c√∫pula- discoteca con una visi√≥n sobre Barcelona sur espl√©ndida. Y por si fuera poco un extraordinario buffet de desayuno con toda clase de t√©s i de caf√©s. Gastronom√≠a excelente en la cena de fin de a√±o. Pienso repetir. No me lo pierdo.,5,2015,01,04
30,Al top prezzo / qualit√†,"Questo √® il mio hotel preferito  a Barcellona , il prezzo √® il miglior per un top hotel di design come questo , una torre di cristallo con arredamenti moderni di tendenza . Al suo interno un ottimo ristorante , un piano con un business center comodissimo per veloci incontri e piccoli spuntini . Collegato all'hotel una grande palestra con piscina al coperto . √à vicino all'aeroporto e alla tangenziale . Indicato per chi viene a Barcellona per lavoro ma non per svago o vacanza .",5,2015,01,03
30,Muy bien,"La habitacion no era muy grande pero tenia unas vistas preciosas sobre todo por la noche. El restaurante fue la mejor eleccion para cenar con un trato exquisito. Muy bien adaptado para personas con movilidad reducida aunque encuentro que la cama es algo alta. Somos vegetarianos y nos alegro mucho que en la carta del restaurante tuvieran platos vegetarianos y debidamente se√±alados , cosa que no nos suele pasar a menudo.
Volveremos , espero que sea pronto.

30,magnifico!!!,"El hotel est√° genial, las instalaciones y el sevicio... el restaurante es estupendo, de primera. La atencion por el servicio de camareros inmejorable. En recepcion fueron super amables. El hitel est√° muy cerca del centro si vas en coche.
      
      ",5,2014,12,31
30,Trato y personal inmejorable,"Fue nuestra primera visita a Barcelona, fuimos dos parejas, la verdad es que quedamos encantados. El hotel de una calidad excelente, se nota que se esmeran por hacer que uno se sienta bien. En concreto Rub√©n de recepci√≥n fue muy atento con nosotros resolviendo todas nuestras dudas (que no eran pocas) y haci√©ndonos unas estupendas recomendaciones que nos ayudaron a conocer la ciudad de una forma m√°s comoda. Sin duda recomiendo este hotel y seguro que volveremos a visitarlo.",5,2014,12,30
30,Demasiado eventual en el servicio.,"Durante cuatro d√≠as he utilizado sus instalaciones. Y para ser un 5*, tiene cosas muy graves que mejorar: la eventualidad de la mayor√≠a del personal de servicio en Comedor y Barra de cafeter√≠a( por cierto, ""cafeter√≠a"" es mucho decir a la barra colocada tras recepci√≥n...), eso s√≠ por 15 ‚Ç¨ la consumici√≥n de Gin T√≥nic, deber√≠an saber lo que est√°n poniendo, un Sr. atiende y en los picos de trabajo aparece un ayudante que desmerece el puesto. En comedor, se nota la eventualidad del personal, sin uniformar/identificaci√≥n y sobre todo el servicio lo hace en funci√≥n de instrucciones del Maitre, y no atienden demandas de clientes, sino es ""a rega√±a dientes "". 
Los ascensores, merecen un comentario aparte:

4 unidades y solo da servicio 1 unidad por llamada. Ejemplo: 50 personas solicitan el ascensor en la plantaci√≥n Lobby y hasta que no llega una unidad, los otros tres no se ponen en servicio psa esa planta. Una mal√≠sima gesti√≥n del software de los mismos. 

En cuanto a las habitaciones standard, pues normales para este tipo de hoteles. 

Uso hoteles al menos 2/3 veces por mes, habitualmente de 4 * y no creo este sea nada superior, salvo por dimensiones de pasillos y poco m√°s.",2,2014,12,27
30,Qu√© m√°s se puede pedir!,"La verdad es que nosotros siempre que viajamos intentamos buscar hoteles baratos y dentro de nuestras posibilidades pero para celebrar fechas especiales nos damos un homenaje en nuestra ciudad y por calidad y precio siempre elegimos el Hesperia Tower, desde que entras en el hall te hacen sentir especial y todos los servicios que ofrecen son de lo mejor que se puede encontrar en Barcelona a un precio m√°s que razonable",5,2014,12,24
30,Siempre excelente,"Mantener el nivel de atenci√≥n y servicio es complicado en cualquier √°mbito, pero ellos lo consiguen.
Soy cliente habitual, y siempre consiguen que mi estancia sea agradable. Nunca me planteo ir a otro hotel en Barcelona.",5,2014,12,24
30,Fant√°stico hotel y restaurante!,"Ayer estuve en este hotel como regalo sorpresa para mi pareja. Al llegar tuvimos una agradable bienvenida y el recepcionista fue muy amable en no comentar que √≠bamos a una suite duplex y que ten√≠amos programado un ba√±o con cava en el jacuzzi, porque les envi√© un mail avis√°ndoles que era una sorpresa y que no queria que dijesen nada al llegar.
La habitaci√≥n era incre√≠ble y muy espaciosa, tenia el jacuzzi justo al lado de la ventana con vistas a Barcelona lo cual nos encant√≥.
Por la noche fuimos a cenar al restaurante Bouquet ya que no hay muchos restaurantes interesantes alrededor, y acab√≥ siendo lo que mas nos gusto del hotel.
El maitre muy atento y simp√°tico, seguimos sus recomendaciones y acertamos al 100%.
Recomendamos mucho el tartar de at√∫n, las vieiras y el cordero asado.
En cuanto al ambiente es muy intimo y relajado, volveremos sin lugar a dudas.
Nosotros no √≠bamos a hacer turismo por la ciudad de Barcelona, pero al llegar nos explicaron que tenian un servicio gratuito de shuttle al aeropuerto y al centro de la ciudad, lo cual considero un punto a destacar.",5,2014,12,22
30,"Si lo ves, te enamora. Si lo pruebas, te vas con otra",La estancia es c√≥moda y agradable. El ba√±o con hidromasaje que pierde agua bajo la puerta saliendo al exterior. Sin espejo tocador. En la cena un solomillo olvidado en la plancha con camarero sin experiencia ni respaldo del metre. Desayuno de bufete a la altura de un 5 estrellas,4,2014,12,22
30,Gran Hotel,"Fui con mi pareja y nos encant√≥ el hotel! Muy amables en recepci√≥n, habitaci√≥n muy bonita! Vistas incre√≠bles!! Tienen un servicio de lanzadera que va al centro, el metro muy cerca del hotel! Sin duda repetiremos ls experiencia. Disponen de gimnasio de pago",5,2014,12,16

Was soll ich sagen, es war sehr angenehm und sch√∂n. Wir hatten eine Suite gebucht und sie war unglaublich sch√∂n! Sie war im 20. Stock und man hatte eine wundervolle Aussicht. Das Bad hatte eine gro√üe Badewanne (mit diesen Blubbern :D) und eine sehr gro√üe Dusche (Duschgel und Shampoo waren von Bvlgari). Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war f√ºr den Preis in Ordnung.

30,Muy buena relacion calidad/precio,"Me aloje durante 4 dias y aunque me encontaba en la ciudad condal por negocios pude disfrutar de la estancia. Las vistas desde mi habitacion daban a Barelona y eran preciosas. La habitacion era espaciosa y tranquila. El desayuno muy recomendable! El metro esta justo delante y va directo al centro, y tienen un servicio de shuttle que te recoge y te lleva al aeropuerto el cual se encuentra a 10/15 minutos. Durante mi segunda y tercera noche queria ir a cenar por el centro de Barcelona y las recomendaciones por parte de una recpecionista fueron excepcionales me encantaron los dos restaurantes a los cuales me envio!! Evidentemente si quieres algo centrico no es el hotel adecuado para ello, pero si lo que buscas es tranquilidad y relajacion es el hotel perfecto!",4,2014,12,15

30,Decepcion,Quise hacer un regalo para mi pareja el d√≠a de su cumplea√±os y me decepciono mucho este hotel de 5 estrellas. El check in fue muy fr√≠o. Parec√≠a que molestara porque estaban hablando entre ellos de sus cosas. El desayuno a la habitaci√≥n llego una hora mas tarde. El camarero nos pidi√≥ disculpas y nos dijo que no nos lo cobrar√≠an por el retraso pero esta incluido en la factura. Hice una reclamaci√≥n online y eso fue hace 4 a√±os y nada. No lo recomiendo nunca!,2,2014,12,04

L'Hotel √® situato in una zona molto tranquilla con parcheggio esterno gratuito ed eventuale parcheggio sotterraneo a pagamento e vicinissimo alla metro. Appena arrivati una gentile receptionist, che parlava un ottimo italiano, ci ha proposto la suite con una aggiunta di soli 30 euro a notte oltre il nostro pacchetto prenotato con venere. Camera su due livelli con soggiorno, frigo e bagno al piano terra e camera, doccia e vasca idromassaggio al piano superiore.. il tutto al 25¬∞ piano con una vista da urlo. Che dire. FANTASTICO. Torneremo quanto prima. Grazie grazie grazie",5,2014,11,23

Ottima e di livello la prima colazione (visto che avevo questa tipologia di soggiorno).
Personale gentilissimo sempre. Ubicazione a 6 km dall'aeroporto (attenzione al costo dei taxi, il tassista pretendeva una cifra esosa quando il tassametro ne indicava un terzo dell'importo!!)

Der Ausblick von den Zimmern (entweder Stadt oder Flughafen) sowie die Freundlichkeit des Personals sind positiv zu erw√§hnen. Der Zustand der Zimmer k√∂nnte besser sein und auch die Sauberkeit war nicht perfekt. Es gibt einen kostenlosen Shuttle Service zum Flughafen und in die Stadt der, wenn er nicht gerade in der 5 s√ºndigen Mittagspause ist, sehr angenehm ist. Ansonsten ist der Flughafen gut per Bus und die Stadt per Metro zu erreichen. Restaurant / Bar auf dem Dach war geschlossen. ",3,2014,10,26

Die Verbindung mit der Metro ins Zentrum war sehr gut, Station knapp 300m vom Hotel und den Service des Hotels einen Shuttlebus in die Stadt und zum Flughafen einzusetzen fanden wir sehr gut. Der einzige Nachteil den wir sehen ist, dass es weit und breit keine Einkaufsm√∂glichkeit gibt, geschweige denn ein Restaurant!",4,2014,10,21
30,Preis-Leistung stimmt!,"Wir haben eine Woche lang in diesem Hotel gewohnt, und es war alles top.
Das Zimmer war sehr sauber, die Betten waren gut, die Bettw√§sche wurde mehrfach gewechselt.
Auch das Bad war sehr sauber, die Aufteilung des Zimmers allerdings etwas gew√∂hnungsbed√ºrftig - beim Betreten des Zimmers steht man sofort im Badezimmer, Dusche und WC sind nur durch eine Schwingt√ºr abgetrennt. Das Personal war ausgesprochen freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war gut, der Kaffee super, die Bedienungen sehr nett und kompetent. Die Anbindung an die Stadt ist gut, die Metro in knapp 5 Minuten zu Fu√ü zu erreichen. Die Fahrt ins Zentrum dauert dann kanppe 30 Minuten. Beim n√§chsten Aufenthalt werden wir uns wieder f√ºr dieses Hotel entscheiden. 
Alles in allem sollte man auch das Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis sehen, bevor man m√§kelt ...! Im √ºbrigen ist der Eintritt in die Sagrada Familia mit 5 ‚Ç¨ sehr g√ºnstig, wenn man bedenkt, dass die Kirche zum gro√üen Teil selbstfinanziert ist / wird ...!",4,2014,10,09

30,"3Sterne, mehr nicht","Ausgehend vom 50% Rabatt f√ºr den Aufenthalt, kann ich mich hier mit den topbewertern nicht identifizieren! 
Flughafenn√§he und der shuttleservice waren einzig positiv zu bewerten! 
Kurz und knapp gesagt war zu viel unprofessionell und unseri√∂s. Angefangen von √ºbertriebenen Preisen der minibar, Freundlichkeit wird eher klein geschrieben, Fr√ºhst√ºck war recht gut, aber wir f√ºhlten uns etwas st√∂render, statt ein zu bedienender Gast zu sein! 
10,- Pfand f√ºr einen Regenschirm erwartet man in einem 5 Sterne Haus eigentlich auch nicht. 
Statt einer Toilettenb√ºrste war ein Telefon montiert, hilft aber unwesentlich beim reinigen der Sch√ºssel!! 
Weder ein Wasserkocher noch B√ºgelbrett /-Eisen sind vorhanden. 
Ausblick spielt keine gro√üe Rolle, wenn man mal einige Schritte in die umgehende Bezirke wagt.

L'Albergo si raggiunge facilmente dall'aeroporto sia con la navetta messa a disposzione dell'albergo che con la linea pubblica numero 45 (la femata del T2 subito a destra dell'uscita dell'aeroporto).
Alla distanza di 100 metri c'√® la fermata della metro che con  circa 20 minuti porta in centro citt√†, qualora la sera non si volesse ritornare in centro oppure e si volessero fare  due passi per andare a cena  nelle vicinanze c'√® un ristorante che si chiama Flama dalla qualit√† e prezzo molto interessante, vi consiglio di provarlo. Ristorante locale e non turistico.
Dimenticavo l'Albergo mette a disposzione anche un servizio navetta (gratis) per andare e tornare dal centro.
Se non cecate la confusione ma apprezzate la qualit√† questo albergo fa per voi.",5,2014,09,17
30,Increible,"Fuimos en Agosto y nos toco una habitaci√≥n en la planta 12. Fue una noche incre√≠ble con unas vistas espectaculares! 
Uno de los problemas que tiene es que en las habitaciones estandars no hay ba√±era solo ducha. Pero igualmente es todo muy bonito.

Relaci√≥n calidad precio perfecto. Muy recomendable!",5,2014,09,13
30,"Gut, wenn man Barcelona schon kennt und K√ºstenorte besuchen m√∂chte!","Das Hotel liegt wirklich sehr nah Flughafen, blo√ü kein Taxi nehmen. Es gibt einen Bus, der h√§lt direkt vor der T√ºr! Das Hotel ist von au√üen etwas Angst einfl√∂√üend, aber von innen ist es von der Kette NH-Hotels renoviert und √ºbernommen worden und wirklich sehr schick, und man hat eine tolle Aussicht. Es gibt insgesamt 29 Stockwerke. Die Zimmer sind sauber und stilvoll eingerichtet, das Bad ist riesig. Man steht direkt drin, wenn man die T√ºr aufmacht, aber es gibt zu viele Spiegel, das verwirrt einen am Anfang sehr. Aircondition l√§sst sich regeln und auch komplett ausschalten. 
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist auf gar keinen Fall 5 Sterne wert. Es ist ok, auf Nachfrage bekommt man auch ein Omlette gemacht, wird einem aber nicht von sich aus angeboten.

Es gibt einen Ubahn Station direkt vor der T√ºr, L1 bringt einen ohne Umstieg direkt bis zum Placa Catalunya. Dauert so 25min, normalerweise... Im Moment gibt es aber Schienenersatzverkehr, da die ersten beiden Haltestellen gesperrt sind wegen Bauma√ünahmen. Das verl√§ngert die Fahrt nach Barcelona rein so um 15 min.

Da wir Barcelona schon oft besucht hatten, war das f√ºr uns ok, da wir keinen Sightseeing Stress hatten und auch eher die K√ºste Richtung Sigtes erkundigt hatte. 

Was entt√§uschend ist: das Hotel wird im Internet als SPA Hotel angek√ºndigt und vor Ort erf√§hrt man dann, dass man f√ºr die Benutzung des Pools usw. 14‚Ç¨ pro Person bezahlen muss. Davon steht nirgends etwas.",3,2014,09,11
30,Vale la pena,"Vale la pena alojarse lejos del centro de la ciudad y recibir un grato por encima del precio que pagas. La atenci√≥n del equipo humano es exquisita, algo que me har√° repetir en el futuro como hotel en la ciudad Condal. La calida de la cama, ducha y desayuno se merecen matricula de honor, fundamental cuando buscas reponerte y descansar despu√©s de un dia de trabajo u ocio.",5,2014,09,10
30,Unseri√∂s und katastrophal unsauber,"Mein Fazit voran (Ausf√ºhrlicher Bericht im Folgenden):

-Unseri√∂s: 
Upgrade auf Suite wird aufgen√∂tigt. Wird dem Reisenden als einzige M√∂glichkeit verkauft.

-Miserable Hotelf√ºhrung:
Abgewohnt und sehr dreckig (s.Fotos), Schimmel in Zimmer 1, Leck in Dusche mit √úberschwemmung im 2. Zimmer. In beiden Zimmern L√∂cher in Stuhlbez√ºgen, staubig, miefiger Geruch. B√§der nicht geputzt. Flure und Lobby abgenutzt. Kratzer und Flecken √ºberall. Renovierungsbed√ºrftig.

-Schlechter Service:
Personal unfreundlich, wie Computer rattern sie alles runter und gehen nicht auf den Gast ein. CallCenter Feeling.

-Ausstattung:
Zimmer in sehr dunklem Holz gehalten. Sehr bedr√ºckend. Aussicht auf Ghetto-H√§userblock. Industriegebietslage in der ""Pampa"", ohne jeden noch so kleinen Kiosk in der Umgebung. 

Fazit: Definitiv kein 5 Sterne Hotel! Dar√ºberhinaus dreckig, abgewohnt und in √§usserster Stadtrandlage. Unseri√∂ses Upgrade auf Suite wird in CallCenter Manier aufgen√∂tigt.

Meine Empfehlung:
Wer echte 5 Sterne ohne jede Beanstandung sucht, ist in Barcelona im ""W Barcelona"" richtig. Wer ein sehr sauberes, komfortables Hotel in zentraler Lage, mitten in einem belebten Viertel sucht, ist im ""Crown Plaza Barcelona-Fira Center"" mit 4,5 Sternen gut aufgehoben. Wem eine zentrale Stadtrandlage ausreicht, aber gro√üen Wert auf Sauberkeit und moderne Zimmer legt, der wird  sich im ""Vincci Bit"" mit 4 Sternen sehr wohl f√ºhlen. In diesen Hotels sind wir unter anderem mehrere Male abgestiegen und k√∂nnen von allen Aufenthalten nur Gutes berichten.

Ausf√ºhrlicher Bericht:

Das Hotel Hesperia Tower Barcelona lockt mit 5 Sternen und einem feudalen Foyer. Wer genauer hinschaut, sieht allerdings, dass das Hotel schlecht gef√ºhrt wird und seine beste Zeit schon l√§nger hinter sich hat. Abgewetzte Ecken, schmuddelige Teppiche, Flecken wohin man schaut. Wie ein Hotel nach nur 9 Jahren so aussehen kann, ist mir ein R√§tsel. Ein Hinweis auf die schlechte F√ºhrung.

Wir hatten ein Standardzimmer mit Zustellbett f√ºr unser 6j√§hriges Kind gebucht. Als wir ankamen, mussten wir jedoch ein Upgrade auf eine Suite nehmen, weil unser Kind nicht mit in einem Standardzimmer schlafen d√ºrfe. So etwas hatten wir noch nie erlebt. Wir waren schon in sehr vielen Hotels in der Gegend, √ºberall gibt es ein Zustellbett, oder das Kind kann im Doppelbett der Eltern √ºbernachten. Beim Hesperia muss man mit Kind jedoch eine Suite! mit 2 Schlafzimmern und 2 B√§dern nehmen. Da es sehr fr√ºh morgens war, mussten wir das Upgrade √ºber 50,- auf die Suite nehmen. Gebucht hatten wir f√ºr 99,-, daraus wurden dann 149,-, also mal locker 50% Aufschlag auf den Ausgangspreis. (by the way: wenn ein angebliches 5 Sternehotel f√ºr 99,- seine DZ online anbietet, kann etwas nicht stimmen)
Wir fanden die Begr√ºndung f√ºr das angeblich notwendige Upgrade sehr fadenscheinig. Als ich dann hier bei den Rezensionen dieselbe unseri√∂se Geschichte von Rezensent ""MelissaAustria"" vom 24.08.2014 gelesen habe, der unter anderem Vorwand ebenfalls ein Upgrade nehmen sollte, wurde uns die Masche des Hotels klar. Zimmer zu Dumpingpreisen bei hrs und Co anbieten und die G√§ste vor Ort dann zu Upgrades √ºberreden, indem andere Zimmer angeblich nicht verf√ºgbar w√§ren. Man nutzt die Lage der Reisenden aus, die adhoc keine andere Wahl haben.

Das eigentliche Desaster erwartete uns jedoch auf der Suite im 19. Stock:
Das Zimmer miefte f√ºrchterlich und war extrem schmutzig und renovierungsbed√ºrftig. Schimmel an der Decke (nein, keine √úbertreibung. Da waren ausgewachsene Schimmelflecken an der Decke s. Fotos), √ºberall L√∂cher in Sesselbez√ºgen und Flecken auf Ablagen. Es war staubig, die Dusche extrem ekelig braun verf√§rbt, alles staubig und das Waschbecken komplett ungeputzt. Dort fanden sich Zahnpastareste der Vorg√§nger. Wir haben den desastr√∂sen Zustand auf Fotos festgehalten,  (weil wir so geschockt waren) und haben dann das Zimmer reklamiert. Die 2. Suite, auf die man uns umbuchte, lag in der 17.  Etage und war genauso schmuddelig und abgewohnt. Nur der Schimmel an der Decke fehlte. Da wir eine lange Reise hinter uns hatten, nahmen wir das Zimmer. Als ich jedoch unter der Dusche stand, die ein Leck hatte und damit das ganze Bad unter Wasser setzte, so dass es bis in den Teppich des Schlafzimmers lief und auf unseren Hilferuf bei der Rezeption niemand hoch kam, stornierten wir unsere Buchung und flohen noch am selben Tag aus diesem Horror-Hotel. In Anbetracht unserer Fotos verlief die Stornierung reibungslos. 

Weitere Infos:

Das Hotel liegt in einem Industriegebiet und geh√∂rt zur NH-Kette. Alles was drumherum ist, geh√∂rt NH. Eine Flasche Wasser, oder morgens den ersten Cappuccino aus einem Kiosk nebenan zu holen, ist nicht m√∂glich, denn dort ist absolut tote Hose. Ein 150ml Cappuccino to go, im Pappbecher gereicht, kostet im Hotel 4,50EUR. 

Der Ausblick, der auf den Fotos Barcelona bei Nacht zeigt, sieht toll aus. Kunstst√ºck, denn man erkennt nur ein Lichtermeer. In Wirklichkeit guckt man tags√ºber auf ein riesiges Ghetto Hochh√§user. Man wird depressiv bei dem Anblick und erkennt Barcelona nicht wieder. Ich habe ein Foto von der realen Tagesaussicht hochgeladen.

Die hoteleigenen Parkpl√§tze f√ºr 18,-/Tag sind Wucher in dieser Lage. Mitten in Barcelona sind diese Preise nachvollziehbar, dort drau√üen in der Pampa, wo das Hotel steht, ist es Abzocke.

Das Fr√ºhst√ºck kostet 15,-/Person und ist ganz ok, wenn man davon absieht, das das Personal einen immer wieder √ºber den Haufen l√§uft, um nachzuf√ºllen. Der Gast ist im Hesperia Tower eindeutig nicht K√∂nig. Es gibt jedoch alles, was ein interkontinentales Fr√ºhst√ºck haben muss. Man darf aber nicht zu viel erwarten; die R√ºhreier sind w√§ssrig, der Bacon nicht kross gebraten, sondern eher ged√§mpft, usw. Insgesamt ist man im Restaurant jedoch bem√ºht. 

Und das ist leider das einzig Positive, was es √ºber dieses Hotel zu sagen gibt.

Wir behalten den Hesperia Tower in sehr schlechter Erinnerung und k√∂nnen eine Buchung in diesem Hotel niemandem empfehlen.",1,2014,09,09

30,Restaurante bouquet-hesperia tower,"Restaurante agradable muy bien atendido. La comida est√° bien cocinada y est√° buena, aunque quiz√°s orientada a extranjeros m√°s que al espa√±ol/catal√°n ya que su carta la componen platos tipicos de la zona por ejemplo ""paella"" o ""tabla de quesos espa√±oles"", que podr√≠as degustar mejor en cualquier restaurante de cocina tradicional. 
Pero el conjunto, ambiente+trato/servicio+comida hace que merezca la pena ir a cenar o comer. Algo caro si no vas con una buena oferta tipo restalo o el tenedor.",3,2014,08,31
30,Schlechte Lage. Unseri√∂s.,"Das Hotel an sich ist nicht schlecht. Interessante Bauweise, sch√∂ne Lobby. Die Zimmer sind etwas dunkel gehalten, aber geschmackvoll. 
Allerdings ist die Lage sehr schlecht. Es liegt zu weit au√üerhalb. Die ersten beiden U-Bahn-Stationen sind derzeit gesperrt. Zum Placa Catalunya ben√∂tigt man deshalb ca. 40 Minuten - zuerst mit dem Bus zur ersten offenen U-Bahn-Station und dann mit der U-Bahn weiter ins Zentrum. 
Beim Einchecken wollte man uns ein Upgrade verkaufen und das auf sehr unseri√∂se Weise. Es wurde behauptet, dass ein normales Zimmer erst ab 15:00 Uhr verf√ºgbar ist, wir aber eine Suite sofort (es war ca. 13:00 Uhr) beziehen k√∂nnten. Es war jedoch auch nach mehrmaligem Nachfragen nicht klar ob dieses Upgrade 15 oder 50 Euro pro Nacht kostet, da das Gespr√§ch auf Englisch gef√ºhrt wurde und diese beiden Zahlen sich sehr √§hnlich anh√∂ren. Jedoch haben wir extra gefragt, ob wir also bei 4 Tagen einen Aufpreis von 60 Euro zahlen m√ºssten. Da kam dann noch mal ein klares JA von der Rezeptionistin. Da es uns aber nach der Besichtigung der Suite doch ziemlich unwahrscheinlich erschien, dass wir nur so wenig aufzahlen m√ºssen, haben wir ein weiteres Mal nachgefragt, ob wir sie wirklich richtig verstanden haben. Erst als wir dann ""1 und 5"", nicht ""5 und 0"" kommuniziert haben, konnte sie nicht mehr anders und sagte, dass es in diesem Fall ein Missverst√§ndnis gewesen sei und der Aufpreis 50 Euro pro Nacht betrage. Das war uns nat√ºrlich zu teuer, da das normale Zimmer 300 Euro f√ºr den gesamten Aufenthalt von 4 N√§chten gekostet hat und die Suite so aber auf 500 Euro gekommen w√§re, also fast auf das Doppelte. 
Pl√∂tzlich war dann ein normales Zimmer frei und wir konnten dieses sofort beziehen. Sehr suspekt. Wir sind uns ziemlich sicher, dass man uns hier absichtlich in die Irre f√ºhren wollte.
FAZIT: Dieses Hotel sollte nur gebucht werden, wenn man - wie wir - ein sehr gutes Angebot bekommen hat und sich nicht zu irgendwelchen Upgrades √ºberreden l√§sst. Ansonsten zahlt sich ein zentrumsnahes Hotel aus, das dann auch nicht viel teurer ist.",3,2014,08,24
30,FANTASTICO HOTEL,"Sono stato con la mia squadra di calcio per un torneo organizzato dall'hotel contro altre squadre spagnole e portoghesi.

El personal de recepci√≥n, de bar y en general muy amables y serviciales. Ninguna queja. La habitaci√≥n...algo peque√±a a mi gusto. Decorada con poca gracia y con uso excesivo de la moqueta y el terciopelo, que son materiales d√≠ficiles de limpiar (se ve√≠a sucio) . El lavabo amplio, y curioso. La puerta del aseo mal dise√±ada, porque topa con el wc. Nuestras vistas no eran muy espectaculares, per√≥ no estaban mal. A todo esto, el restaurante Evo cerr√≥ hace tiempo y la zona de arriba esta cerrada al p√∫blico (solo reuniones privadas) as√≠ que el hotel ha perdido mucho de su encanto inicial.

30,Nuestro Hotel,"Este Hotel es el que hemos visitado en m√°s ocasiones, tanto cuando viv√≠amos cerca de su ubicaci√≥n como hace poco que visitamos la ciudad de Barcelona y nos alojamos varios d√≠as en el Hesperia Tower. Lo mejor de este Hotel es sin duda reservar con tiempo, la mala costumbre que tienen hoy en d√≠a todos los hoteles es penalizarte y mucho con precios muy cambiantes y abusivos para la habitaci√≥n y detalles que te van a ofrecer seg√∫n cuando reserves. Nosotros hemos estado en la Suite Duplex en una ocasi√≥n, en la Habitaci√≥n Ejecutiva en otra ocasi√≥n, en la Junior Suite en otra, y el resto, muchas, en la Suite, sin duda una habitaci√≥n de 56 metros cuadrados con todos los  detalles y comodidades que uno puede querer. Algo a destacar es el olor de las Suites, es importante que ya cuando entras huele a limpio, a Spa, o flores o algo as√≠. Las camas de estas habitaciones, King Size, a√∫n no hemos encontrado una cama m√°s c√≥moda en todos los hoteles y casas en las que hemos estado alojados o hemos vivido, no hay manera. El cuarto de ba√±o de la Suite tambi√©n dir√≠a que es el mejor equipado, limpio, funcional, lujoso y amplio en los que hemos estado. La recepci√≥n es espectacular y en general te atienden r√°pido y con educaci√≥n, el Spa tambi√©n es de los mejores (METROPOLITAN), el √∫nico pero, es que est√° un poco aparte y unido a un gran gimnasio de esos que est√° lleno a reventar, gente que por supuesto acudir√° al Spa despu√©s de sudar en la bicicleta o la cinta, pero lo dicho, un muy buen Spa.
Los aspectos negativos que se pueden encontrar en este Hotel seguramente est√°n relacionados con su ubicaci√≥n, est√° en Barcelona, bueno cerca de Barcelona capital, porque el lugar de la Gran V√≠a donde est√° ubicado pertenece a Hospitalet de Llobregat, en concreto frente al Hospital de Bellvitge, cerca tambi√©n del Centro Comercial Gran V√≠a II, o del Ikea, etc. No encuentro que sea mala zona, precisamente porque no est√° en plena ciudad, pero bueno eso ya cada viajero tendr√° sus preferencias y objetivos. Luego est√° el tema Tower Club. Esto en teor√≠a es una ventaja, es una zona de restauraci√≥n que pone canap√©s, bebidas, tapas, caf√©s e infusiones desde la ma√±ana a la noche, tienes sillones, mesas, prensa nacional e internacional, ordenadores con internet, etc. y se supone que esta zona es exclusiva para las habitaciones Ejecutivas y Suites √∫nicamente. Bueno, en los a√±os que he ido a esta zona ha ido empeorando, no se trata de que ya no vale la pena, no es as√≠, est√° muy bien montada, pero la comida que ya era escasa ha ido bajando en calidad y cantidad, hubo d√≠as en los que √∫nicamente est√°bamos 3 √≥ 4 parejas cada uno a lo suyo pero en otras ocasiones hab√≠a familias enteras con ni√±os peque√±os (que en teor√≠a no tienen acceso), gritando, tirando la comida por el suelo, y dejando que sus ni√±os cogieran lo que quisieran aunque fuera para jugar con los croissants en las alfombras, mientras, el resto de gente que lleg√°bamos pues nos ten√≠amos que ir por donde vinimos, claro. Al principio lo ten√≠an muy controlado y te ped√≠an la tarjeta que indica que puedes estar ah√≠, te ped√≠an silencio y la comida aunque poca estaba tapada, limpia y sin mosquitos por encima, la √∫ltima vez que fuimos todo era un poco peor, pero vamos, tiene soluci√≥n.
Habr√© visitado este Hotel unas 15 √≥ 16 veces, cuando vuelva a Barcelona, si lo puedo reservar a unos precios relativamente asequibles repetiremos seguro.",4,2014,05,04
30,"Muy buen hotel, alejado de la ciudad pero con muchos detalles","Hotel alejado de Barcelona, pero con muy buena relaci√≥n calidad precio. 

Lo encontramos justo al final de la linea 1 de metro. En la zona si que no tenemos muchas distracciones, a parte de un Media Markt. 

La habitaci√≥n es extraordinaria, con unas vistas impresionantes. El ba√±o, la ducha, la cama, todo esta a un muy buen nivel.

El desayuno es extraordinario, de mucha calidad. El personal es muy amable y servicial.

Sin ninguna duda un muy buen hotel para viajes de negocios o escapadas de fin de semana.",4,2014,04,29
30,Muy buena experiencia.,"Buen hotel que hace honor a sus 5 estrellas,personal atento i amable.Buen recibimiento en recepci√≥n,vistas magn√≠ficas desde la planta 19 donde dormimos dos noches.El desayuno magn√≠fico y el personal a su cargo excelente muy especialmente la se√±orita Beta( Beatriu). Sin  duda Hotel para repetir.",5,2014,04,28
30,Bellissimo,"Ho letto alcune recensioni negative, credo che sia impossibile dir male dell'Hesperia Tower, mai vista una colazione cos√¨ da sballo ,neppure nelle mega strutture degli Emirati Arabi, l'albergo √® super gente...",5,2014,04,17
30,Rayma y familia,"Habitaci√≥n con vistas impresionantes, amplias, confortables , con un desayuno muy completo y un servicio en todo el hotel de primera. Agradecer la atenci√≥n que tuvieron para conmigo por coincidir celebraci√≥n de cumplea√±os  al regresar de mi paseo y encontrar detalle de NH en mi habitaci√≥n.
En fin  muy buena elecci√≥n para disfrutar de Barcelona.",5,2014,04,13
30,Rareza en la zona,"Se hace extra√±o un hotel de lujo con aire tan vanguardista en un vecindario de aspecto humilde las habitaciones son muy modernas. Las duchas complicadas de entender. Se agradece que hayan simplificado elmundo de los ascensores que hace a√±os, en momentos de alta ocupaci√≥n, se convert√≠an en una ratonera insalvable. Recomendar√≠a el hotel a quien no vaya a ir a pasear al centro por estar muy retirado. Buen desayuno.",4,2014,04,12
30,A Barcellona per affari,"Un ottimo compromesso tra prezzo, servizio, qualit√† delle dotazioni, servizio e cortesia. Ottime sale conferenza. Anche se non √® in centro, √® molto ben collegato tramite la metropolitana (vai praticamente dove vuoi in poco tempo).",5,2014,04,10
30,Un pack realmente rom√°ntico,"Quer√≠amos empezar nuestras cortas vacaciones cerca del aeropuerto para coger el avi√≥n sin estr√©s, y el Hesperia Tower result√≥ una buen√≠sima elecci√≥n para nuestro prop√≥sito. Eleg√≠ el pack rom√°ntico que incluye la cena, el desayuno, y muchas atenciones. La primera alegr√≠a fue un upgrade a una suite impresionante en la planta 20 con vistas de v√©rtigo sobre la ciudad y Montj√ºic. Disfrutamos de la piscina y spa, a pesar de su ubicaci√≥n en un club deportivo muy concurrido, de las bebidas y snacks de la sala privada, de una deliciosa cena de men√∫ en el Restaurante Bouquet, pero sobre todo de la comod√≠sima y amplia suite con ba√±era de hidromasaje. Despu√©s de un muy buen desayuno nos dio mucha pena que nuestro viaje no nos permiti√≥ aprovechar la posibilidad que nos ofrecieron de dejar la habitaci√≥n a las 17h. La zona donde se ubica el hotel no es muy atractiva, ni su situaci√≥n es lo m√°s conveniente para visitar la ciudad, pero lo recomiendo para un escapada en pareja, para asistir a ferias, o para reuniones de trabajo. Hab√≠a un grupo muy numeroso de una farmac√©utica en el hotel, y se les ve√≠a encantados de la experiencia y se les o√≠a mucho tambi√©n, desgraciadamente. La arquitectura di√°fana del hotel con predominio del cristal es muy interesante, pero es un conductor de los ruidos en las salas comunes. Sin embargo la insonorizaci√≥n de la habitaci√≥n s√≠ que es excelente. ",4,2014,04,08
30,Ospitalita`,"Cortesia alla reception, camera ottima ma bagno in condizioni da ""rivedere"", varieta` e abbondanza nella colazione, ottima la posizione con collegamenti rapidi sia da e verso l'aeroporto sia verso la zona fiere.

30,5 estrellas,"Habitaci√≥n de dise√±o moderno, amplia y confortable. Excelente desayuno. Wifi perfecto (Sres NH, realmente es necesario alojarse en un 5 estrellas para disponer de una conexi√≥n de calidad?). Cuenta con un centro de convenciones y me pareci√≥ una buena opci√≥n para una reuni√≥n empresarial, en mi caso se trataba de un congreso y la empresa corr√≠a con los gastos (350/euros x noche!). Hay que tener en cuenta que est√° ubicado en un barrio perif√©rico sin ning√∫n atractivo especial, en caso de buscar alojamiento tur√≠stico para visitar BCN creo que hay opciones mejores",4,2014,04,07
30,Great stay,"Ho soggiornato all'hesperia tower per un viaggio di lavoro.  Ho soggiornato due notti alla fine di Marzo 2014. Ottima colazione,  stanza spettacolare, bagno splendido.  Pulitissimo e ottimo il servizio.  Cordiale lo staff e....sorpresa deliziosa in camera un graditissimo omaggio di un dolce. ..come se fosse il mio compleanno! Grazie avete reso il mio soggiorno meno business e pi√π leisure! Torner√≤ di certo! ",5,2014,04,06
30,Un hotel che non delude le aspettative,"Personale e servizi  rispecchiano la levatura di questo hotel. Era il secondo soggiorno e confermo nessuna sorpresa negativa, comode le stanze e un servizio bagno impeccabile. Lo consiglio sicuramente.

30,Demasiadas estrellas,"Muy buen hotel,espectaculares vistas,habitaciones amplias y elegantes.En el piso 25 hay habitaciones espectaculares con jacuzzi con vistas a Barcelona.Tienen un problema con los ascensores,cuesta una eternidad encontrar ascensor.El precio del bar es excesivo.",4,2014,03,31
30,strategico e professionale,"Sono stato ospite dell' Hesperia Tower in occasione di una fiera nelle vicinanza, la posizione dell' hotel √® ottima per chi arriva in aereo e ha necessit√† di muoversi fuori dalla citt√† o recarsi presso le strutture fieristiche limitrofe.
Buona l' accoglienza e personale sorridente, la hall di grandi dimensioni e ben illuminata, la struttura dell' hotel moderna ed interessante nell' architettura, bella la cupola all' attico con il ristorante panoramico.
Le stanze sono nella norma per questo livello, bello il bagno con doccione ed idromassaggio e wc separato, grave la mancanza del bidet.La stanza era all' apparenza pulita anche se ho trovato la confezione di caramelle, mangiate da qualcuno prima di me, sotto la scrivania.  In generale migliorabili le comunque buone dotazioni da camera ( eravamo in 2 ed abbiamo trovato solo un paio di ciabatte, niente calzascarpe ).
La colazione di buon livello, c' √® tutto e di qualit√†, tranne il caff√© ( ma per noi italiani √® norale) ah e la solita pessima spremuta d' arancia spagnola.
Nel complesso un buon giudizio per un albergo da cui ti aspetti qualcosa in pi√π.",3,2014,03,23
30,Lujo de hotel,"Excelente calidad precio de este hotel 5 estrellas, bien ubicado en la entrada de la ciudad condal desde el aeropuerto.

Para mi, excelente.",4,2014,03,17
30,Stupendo,"Ho soggiornato purtroppo solo una notte in una suite al 25esimo piano. Hotel fantastico, personale eccellente. Inoltre la tower club √® la ciliegina sulla torta. Da questo soggiorno ho imparato una cosa, quando torner√≤ a Barcellona sapr√≤ in che hotel soggiornare. ",5,2014,03,13
30,Gran Hotel,"Gran hotel tiene bien merecido sus 5 estrellas, el hotel muy hermoso y sus instalaciones espectaculares.A la habitaci√≥n no le falta un detalle entre ellos la cama extra c√≥moda con grandes vista a Barcelona, cuenta con un gran ba√±o con columna de hidromasaje, un vestidor....etc, no le falta un detalle.Del personal destacar√≠a la gran amabilidad y su profesionalidad. Lo peor su ubicaci√≥n un poco alejado de Barcelona. En desayuno estupendo.Lo recomiendo sin ninguna duda para mi fue una gran acierto.",5,2014,03,12
30,"Increible, un lujo","Acudi en viaje de negocios, con mi pareja al hotel donde dio lugar la convencion de la compa√±ia para la que trabajo.

El entorno es lo peor que tiene esta alejado de barcelona y no hay nada cercano.

el hotel es precioso, con increibles vistas a toda barcelona, sus instalaciones magnificas y modernas.

La habitacion contaba con cama extra grande y tv 50"" , una salita con sofa cama, otra tv 50"", radio para ipods iphones, kettle con cafe te y agua gratuito, un vestidor con 2 batines y 2 albornoces para despues de la ducha que contaba con columna de hidromasaje o ba√±o en la ba√±era de hidromasaje.

en fin que decir un lujazo, que si no fuera por su alto precio..... recomendarlo almenos es digno de probarlo...",5,2014,03,11
30,Sehr gutes Hotel etwas abseits,"Das Hesperia Tower ist ein architektonisch beeindruckendes Hotel in einem Vorort vor Barcelona.
Die Verkehrsanbindung ist sehr gut, direkt gegen√ºber gibt es einen Taxi-Stop, Bushaltestelle und Metro-Station, die einen in 20 Minuten ins Zentrum bringt.

Das Hotel an sich ist sehr modern ausgestattet und die Zimmer sind absolut sauber und sch√∂n. In den oberen Stockwerken hat man einen atemberaubenden Ausblick, und zwar auf beide Seiten: Einmal zur Stadt und einmal Richtung Flughafen. Besonders nachts ist gerade dieser Ausblick wundersch√∂n mit den startenden und landenden Flugzeugen.

Das Personal war immer sehr zuvorkommend und vorallem an der Rezeption waren die Mitarbeiter sehr sympathisch, von denen einer sogar relativ gut deutsch spricht.

Wenn es einem nichts ausmacht, ein wenig ab vom Schuss zu sein, ist dieses Hotel perfekt! 
Vorallem, wenn man sich die Preis-Leistung anschaut.",5,2014,03,07
30,"Muy buen hotel, con algun detallito...","Hemos estado con mi pareja en una suite d√∫plex del hotel hesperia tower durante un fin de semana y la verdad es que hemos salido muy contentos. El hotel es precioso y el personal de lo m√°s amable que he visto. De todas formas, siempre hay cosas que se pueden mejorar. La habitaci√≥n, una suite en toda regla. Dos pisos de habitaci√≥n bien decorados y con todas las comodidades; amenities de bvlgari, detalles de bienvenida, 2 albornoces por persona, canal+... La cama muy c√≥moda y las vistas increibles, para nosotros lo mejor!!!! El jacuzzi nos pareci√≥ un poco justo, pero con las vistas que tenia se compensaba. Aqu√≠ lo que vimos es que la cortina que tapa la vidriera estava rajada por los laterales y eso hac√≠a feo... Adem√°s, en alguna de las paredes el paper estaba levantado. La suite ten√≠a dos ba√±os, uno en cada planta con secador de pelo, muchas toallas... De la limpieza no tenemos nada que decir, todo bien. El spa es quiz√°s un poco justito.. Pero est√° bastante bien. En cuanto al acceso a la planta 5 con cositas para picar todo el dia, hay que decir que hab√≠a mucha m√°s bebida que comida... Echamos en falta un poco m√°s de variedad. A pesar de estas peque√±as cositas, En general, salimos muy contentos del hotel, para repetir sin duda.",4,2014,03,07
30,Acogedor.,"Visita de la ciudad de Barcelona, √∫ltimo finde febrero/14.
Hotel acogedor, tranquilo. A 5' del hotel esta la linea roja de metro, en 15' en Plz. Catalu√±a.
La recepci√≥n estupenda. La asistencia en el desayuno, muy bien. El mismo desayuno, estupendo. Instalaciones comunes y habitaciones muy ordenadas. Las habitaciones  con todo lo necesario para el aseo personal. En conjunto sobresaliente. En el mercado de la boquer√≠a, si quieres tomar alguna raci√≥n en alguno de los quioscos al uso, deber√≠as de situarte pronto en alguno de ellos, pues tienen mucha demanda y resulta dificil tomar asiento.",4,2014,03,06
30,Un hotel ottimo,"Recentemente ho effettuato con mia moglie una vacanza a Barcellona e visto l'ottimo rapporto qualit√† prezzo per un 5 stelle, anche se non centrale, abbiamo optato per questa struttura usufruendo degli appartamenti (con angolo cottura)  a fianco  della grande struttura principale. 
E' un hotel nuovissimo, minimale e molto moderno. I servizi ottimi e anche il ristorante al 2 piano ( dove abbiamo cenato la prima sera)  alla fine, per il prezzo corrisposto, √® stato forse la migliore cena che abbiamo effettuato a barcellona in un ambiente fantastico, elegante, coccolati e serviti con grande professionalit√† dal personale molto attento. La colazione in Hotel era fantastica.",5,2014,03,06
30,Siempre agusto,"Es un hotel en el que me alojado numerosas ocasiones, desde su inauguraci√≥n me ha encantado. El trato por parte de los empleados es excelente.

30,Excepcional,"Reservamos un paquete rom√°ntico, nos alojamos en una Suite mi marido y yo y salimos encantados!! El personal de recepci√≥n que nos atendi√≥ a la llegada muy profesional y atento. Todo el personal en general, cuidan el detalle. 
La habitaci√≥n en la √∫ltima planta muy bonita, vistas a Barcelona espectaculares y el jacuzzi al lado de la cama impresionante. Nos dejaron un detalle en la habitaci√≥n (fresas con chocolate y cava) que entraba en el paquete y lo disfrutamos mucho. Cabe destacar tambi√©n el SPA y sus instalaciones.
Cenamos en el restaurante Bouquet, muy bonito y fino, la comida muy buena, el servicio por parte de las camareras muy exquisito, lo que hace el restaurante muy acogedor.
Recomendamos a todo el mundo darse un respiro en este fabuloso hotel. Merece la alojarse y disfrutar de las instalaciones. Desconectamos que era nuestro objetivo, incluso superaron nuestras expectativas.",5,2014,03,04

Situado entre Barcelona, zonas industriales y el aeropuerto, ideal para viajes de Negocios, pero tambi√©n para turismo por su cercan√≠a a Barcelona.",5,2014,02,24
30,Realmente impresionante,"Excelente, el mejor hotel que pudimos haber escogido. A su favor todo, situacion, atencions, dise√±o, amplitud de las habitaciones, detalles en el ba√±o. El sevicio de habitaciones rapidisimo. Algo muy importante: la cama king-sice ademas de grande extraordinariamente comoda. Las vistas de la habitacion buenas. Solo un pero, serviran haber dos pares de cabanillas de ba√±o puesto que ed h√†bitacci√≥n doble pero √©s cierto que hay un aviso en el ba√±o que dice que puedes pedir cualquier accesorio de ba√±o mas que desees.
Simplemente extraordinario",5,2014,02,21

30,Fin de semana perfecto,"Era la primera vez que viaj√°bamos a Barcelona y decid√≠ escoger un hotel de calidad seg√∫n opiniones y consejos de gente que ya hab√≠an estado. No me defraudaron! Nada m√°s llegar la amabilidad y el buen ambiente se notaba, y nos aconsejaron muy bien sobre las visitas que hacer y la forma de movernos por la ciudad. Nos dieron una habitaci√≥n con preciosas vistas, es de agradecer

Solo hubo un inconveniente,que esa misma ma√±ana les llam√© para pedirles un pedido para mi habitaci√≥n que era una sorpresa para mi novia, pero cuando llegamos no hab√≠a nada. Lo solucionaron r√°pido y me recompesaron gratamente debido a que el factor sorpresa se esfum√≥. 
El desayuno muy variado y limpio. Gran amabilidad de todo el personal de restauraci√≥n y atentos.
Una estancia muy grata y aconsejable.
Una pena que el restaurante de la cima del hotel no estuviera operativo.

Reservamos una habitaci√≤n triple y la verdad que nos dieron una habitaci√≤n muy amplia que ofrece las comodidades que se necesitan cuando uno viaja, cama super comoda, ducha, hidromasaje, tele, cajafuerte, buena conexion internet. Hotel con vistas impresionantes hacia la ciudad, servicio impecable por parte del personal, probamos la comida en el restaurante Bouquet con un men√π que estaba bien de precio. Desayuno completo. Tuvimos que pagar por la entrada al Spa porque no la teniamos incluida en nuestra tarifa. Para movernos a la ciudad cogimos la lanzadera que tiene unos horarios y es bastante comoda (tarda unos 20 minutos). Tiene parada de metro justo al lado (se llega al centro en 25 minutos, misma linea). Hotel moderno, est√† un poco lejos del centro, pero nos pudimos mover bastante bien. 
Nuestra experiencia fu√© muy positiva.",4,2014,02,14

No pude verlo hasta que regrese a mi pa√≠s y por la diferencia e horario no he podido coincidir.  No me han resuelto nada. Siguen sin devolverme el dinero y me dijeron que mi reserva se hab√≠a duplicado y que aparec√≠a como no show  cuando yo me presente los d√≠a que reserve. La verdad un robo descarado!

30,Imposantes Hotel mit freundlichem Personal,"Das Hotel Hesperia Tower steht im westlichen Vorort L'Hospitalet von Barcelona, hat jedoch eine direkte Metro-Anbindung ins Zentrum (25 Minuten). Imposant ist der Ausblick vom Zimmer auf die Stadt und den Hafen - besonders wenn man ein Zimmer nach Osten hat - also Richtung Zentrum. Die Zimmer sind sehr stylisch, man schl√§ft sehr gut. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcks-Buffet l√§sst keinen Wunsch offen und ist sehr gut, es gibt 10 verschiedene Kaffee-Sorten zur Auswahl - wo gibt es das sonst? Auch die Restaurants sind Spitze, man kann also nach einer ausgiebigen Stadttour den Abend gem√ºtlich im Hotel ausklingen lassen.

30,Recomendable,"Room-service abusivo. Apenas hay nada para cenar o tomar algo cerca y se aprovechan de ello. 23 euros por una ca√±a y un sandwich en su cafeteria. Adem√°s si estas en el aparthotel que tienen al lado, el room service solo funciona a partir de las 12 de la noche y te aplican un recargo de 5 euros. Lo dicho, ABUSIVO!!!",4,2014,01,31
30,lujo asequible,"El hotel en s√≠ ya es espectacular, con un hall maravilloso e instalaciones estupendas. Ciertamente la zona no es ninguna maravilla, pero las vistas a la ciudad de Barcelona desde las junior suite son una pasada. El pack escapada rom√°ntica realmente merece la pena, pero si he de destacar algo del hotel ser√≠a sin duda su atento personal que se desvivi√≥ porque la estancia fuese de nuestro agrado. Sin duda repetir√≠a contratando el mismo tipo de servicio. Ideal si vas a volar desde el Prat, queda a 15 minutos o menos.",5,2014,01,23
30,Buena experiencia,"El paquete rom√°ntico estuvo muy bien, al principio tuvimos problemas con mal olor en la habitaci√≥n pero inmediatamente nos cambiaron.

Lo √∫nico malo es la ubicaci√≥n y que el spa no es propiamente un spa, es un gimnasio con una secci√≥n de spa no muy relajante",4,2014,01,23
30,Caro y mala ubicaci√≥n.,"Malo en el sentido que te cobran cuatro euros por un cortado para la zona en la que es√° situado.
No es de las mejores zonas de Barcelona, por lo que la calidad - precio no est√° compensada.

30,Un week end con i fiocchi,"Ho trascorso lo scorso fine settimana nell'avveniristico Hesperia Tower di Barcellona e sono rimasto molto, e sottolineo molto, soddisfatto di questo hotel. Comodissimo il transfer gratuito da e per l'aereoporto e da e per il centro che fa scordare la posizione non centralissima dell'hotel. 
Stanze ampie e con splendida veduta ( io ero al 17¬∞ piano). Personale solerte e disponibile.Colazione veramente favolosa. Pulizia accurata e splendido centro benessere collegato con l'hotel.Insomma un posto speciale ed un'accoglienza che ti fa sentire speciale.Insomma l'asse portante di un week end con i fiocchi",5,2014,01,13
30,Fin de semana fantastico,"Estuvimos este finde semana de reyes celebrando nuestro aniversario y solo puedo decir que todo fue espectacular,la habitacion fantastica con unas vistas de barcelona increibles a parte de ser un peque√±o apartamento de lujo en el que no faltaba detalle.Recomiendo sin ninguna duda cenar en el restaurante del hotel,la comida de gran calidad y un servicio excelente todo dentro de un espacio fantastico que hizo de la cena una experiencia inolvidable.El servicio y la atencion al cliente muy profesional y atenta a cualquier cosa que pudieramos necesitar,es posible que no sea un hotel muy centrico pero las conexiones de transporte al centro de barcelona son muchas y muy accesibles.....sin ninguna duda volvere a visitarlo.",5,2014,01,06
30,FAMILIA CON NI√ëO DE 5 A√ëOS,"Es un hotel muy moderno que a mi hijo de 5 a√±os le ha encantado. Tiene todas las comodidades y un dise√±o impresionante. Fui con mi hijo por el SPA y resulta que solo se pod√≠a utilizar a partir de 18 a√±os. Para compensar a mi hijo ,nos dieron una habitaci√≥n superior sin coste adicional lo que me pareci√≥ un detallazo que quiero agradecer desde aqu√≠.

Est√° un poco aislado de todo, como en un pol√≠gono, pero para mi que iba de trabajo, no de turismo, la situaci√≥n me daba igual ya que est√° a pie de autovias y por la ma√±ana te ahorras los atascos.",5,2014,01,06

30,Boda y nochce increibles,"Celebramos en este hotel nuestra boda hace un a√±o y la organizaci√≥n fue perfecta. Posteriormente, nos han obsequiado con una noche para celebrar el aniversario.

30,Senza parole,Ho lasciato da poco questo hotel dopo un soggiorno di 5 giorni. Che dire!!! Ogni parola √® superflua per descrivere. Ho preso un coupon con groupon e siamo andati. 5 giorni da favola. A partire dalla camera continuando con la colazione da mille e una notte...io ho viaggiato ma un albergo cosi mai trovato.....eccellente e da raccomandare. Grazie,5,2014,01,01
30,Buen hotel,"Es un buen hotel, brinda servicios correctos, pero no es c√°lido.

30,Modernes Hotel mit Schw√§chen,"Das Hotel ist ein Businesshotel und liegt au√üerhalb vom Stadtzentrum Barcelonas. Jedoch ist dieses mit der Metro sehr gut zu erreichen. Die Metrostation liegt nur 300m vom Hotel entfernt und die Metro (Linie L1) f√§hrt direkt zum Zentrum (Haltestelle Catalunya).  Die Zimmer sind modern und qualitativ sehr gut eingerichtet.  Nun kommen wir zu den Nachteilen des Hotels. Der Service ist zum teil mangelhaft, dies zeigt sich vor allem im Tower Club. Dort wird selten aufger√§umt und nachgef√ºllt. Des Weiteren sind die Snacks mehr als entt√§uschend, welche abgesehen vom kleinen continentalen Fr√ºhst√ºck aus Chips, Popcorn und S√º√üigkeiten bestehen. Der Aufpreis lohnt sich nicht!  Im Gegensatz ist der Spa & Fitnessbereich sehr gut, da dieser von der Fitnesskette Metropolitan betrieben wird, welches man als Hotelgast mitbenutzen kann. 

Insgesamt ein sch√∂nes und ruhiges Hotel, welches jedoch seinen eigenen Anspr√ºchen nicht gerecht wird. Dies zeigt sich vor allem im Tower club, dort zeigten sich auch nach mehrmaliger Beschwerde keine Beserungen! 

Positiv ist noch das Hotelre",4,2013,12,29
30,Bene per un 5 stelle,"Bella sorpresa per un viaggio di affari a Barcellona,ritrovarmi al 24¬∞ piano in una bella suite, spaziosa con una vista eccellente sulla citt√†, mi ha fatto pensare subito che godevo di un confort con qualit√† prezzo molto conveniente,infatti la stanza √® costata come un 3 stelle a Milano.
La posizione della struttura in periferia ma ben collegata alla citt√†, pecca solo di una segnaletica non adeguata per chi arriva in macchina,prestate attenzione allo svincolo s√® vi sbagliate tocca fare un bel giro per ritornare indietro.
Il personale √® molto preparato e mette immediatamente a proprio agio l'ospite,la pulizia delle camere rispetta lo standard ,come anche le dotazioni del bagno ottime le spugne, il letto ampio e con un buon materasso e 2 cuscini per persona molto soffici.
La colazione merita ma possono fare pi√π attenzione al ricevimento ,il riconoscimento dell'ospite e delle sua camera deve essere fatto con pi√π discrezione.
Il mio modesto giudizio rimane ampiamente positivo, sicuramente da consigliare.",4,2013,12,28
30,Gutes Hotel... Super Restaurant! ,"Wir, Paar aus der Schweiz, (24&22), sind f√ºr 4 Tage im Hotel. Das Zimmer ist gut. Die Minibar ist extrem teuer... Aber ansonsten ist alles super. Vorallem das Restaurant f√ºr das Abendessen, wie auch das Restaurant f√ºr das Fr√ºhst√ºck sind perfekt! Damit man in die Stadt kommt, muss man entweder mit dem Taxi, dem Shuttlebus oder der U-Bahn fahren! Im Grossen und Ganzen... Gutes Hotel f√ºr ein Kurztrip durch Barcelona.",4,2013,12,21

30,Buen hotel en las afueras de Barcelona,"Hotel singular ubicado en una torre alta de 107 metros en Hospitalet, coronado por una ""platillo"" donde en su d√≠a tuvo un restaurante Santi Santimaria Evo, ahora cerrado por su fallecimiento y la falta de rentabilidad.

Las habitaciones est√°n elegantemente decoradas en un estilo moderno y funcional. Las vistas, especialmente de las plantas altas y orientadas a Barcelona son espectaculares. Hab√≠a estado en el hotel anteriormente hace unos a√±os y debo reconocer que el mantenimiento es muy correcto. Por poner una pega, el cierre de las cortinas no funciona todo lo bien que debiera y por las ma√±anas entra mucha luz.

El personal de recepci√≥n muy correcto, profesional y √°gil.

El desayuno s√≥lo correcto. No demasiada variedad ni calidad para el tipo de hotel que es.",4,2013,12,16

Esta fuera de Barcelona, pero el metro esta muy cerca y un taxi a la catedral, por ejemplo, no cuesta mas de 15 euros.
El hotel dispone de transfer cada cierto tiempo, pero no lo utilizamos.",5,2013,11,21
30,"Sehr modern und empfehlenswert, aber mit kleinen Schwachstellen","Wir (Paar aus Deutschland 23 und 19 Jahre) hatten 5 Tage ein Kingbed- Nichtraucherzimmer gebucht. Bekamen dann auch das gew√§hlte Zimmer im 16. Stock.

Das Hotel macht von au√üen einen imposanten Eindruck durch seine H√∂he (28 Stockwerke + Restaurant auf dem Dach). Der Eingang ist auch freundlich gestaltet mit einem roten Teppich. sowie rechts und links Wasser. Die Lobby ist riesig und durch Marmor sehr modern gehalten. Der Check-In geht flott und unkompliziert, so dass man schnell das Zimmer beziehen kann. 
Nach Betreten des Zimmers steht man direkt im Bad, wo sich auch der ""Kleiderschrank"" befindet, dieser besteht aus einer Art Regal mit 2 gro√üen F√§chern oben, danach folgt der Safe hinter einer T√ºr, dann kommen 4 kleine Schubladen und darunter nochmal 2 gro√üe Schubladen. Rechts und links befinden sich dann noch 2 Kleiderstangen mit 5 B√ºgeln. F√ºr 2 Pesonen und 5 Tage Aufenthalt leider etwas zu wenig Platz.
Das Bad ist mit vielen gro√üen Spiegeln ausgetattet und besteht aus 2 Waschbecken, einer Toilette und einer wirklich gro√üen und modernen Regendusche mit 6 kleinen D√ºsen, welche wunderbar den K√∂rper ""massieren"". Au√üerdem gibt es zus√§tzlich einen kleinen Duschkopf mit Schlauch zum abnehmen.
Durch eine Glast√ºr geht es dann weiter zum Wohnbereich, welcher mit einem gro√üen Bett, Schreibtisch, Regal und Couch direkt am Panoramafenster ausgestattet ist. Ebenfalls h√§ngt dort ein gro√üer Flatscreenfernseher an der Wand mit internationalen Programmen (Kabel1, Sat1, Pro7 und RTLAustria als deutschsprachige), au√üerdem findet man eine iPhone/iPod Dockingstation auf dem Schreibtisch. Im Schreibtisch befindet sich auch die Minibar, welche allerdings sehr teuer ist (0,33l Coca Cola 6‚Ç¨). 
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck besteht aus einem reichhaltigen Buffett, ist aber mit 15‚Ç¨ pro Person recht teuer, aber schon angemessen aufgrund der gro√üen Auswahl und freien Getr√§nken. 
Wobei uns hingegen die Preise in den Restaurants sehr stolz vorkamen (Pizza Magherita 18,50‚Ç¨). In der Umgebung findet man aber preiswertere Imbissbuden/Pizzerien oder andere kleine Gastst√§tten.
Ebenfalls in direkter N√§he befindet sich die Metro-Station (5 Minuten Gehweg), mit welcher man in 20 Minuten ohne Umsteigen im Zentrum ist. Eine Einzelfahrt kostet 2‚Ç¨, die 10er-Karte 9,80‚Ç¨.
Alternativ zur Metro bietet das Hotel auch einen kostenlosen Shuttleservice in die Stadt und zum Flughafen an. Morgens sind die Zeiten f√ºr in die Stadt zu kommen optimal (10 und 10:40 Uhr), wir aber fanden die Zeiten um aus der Stadt zum Hotel zu fahren etwas zu fr√ºh (18 und 19:20 Uhr). Der Shuttleservice setzt einem am NH Hotel in der Stadt, unweit (5min Gehweg) vom Placa de Catalunya ab und sammelt auch dort wieder ein. Die Fahrt dauert etwa 20 Minuten. Leider sind die Pl√§tze hier auch nur begrenzt, so dass es vorkommen kann, dass man nicht mitgenommen werden kann. Dies geschah uns 2x, jeweils einmal morgens und einmal abends, also fr√ºh genug erscheinen. 

Zusammenfassend kann man aber sagen, dass das Tower Hotel nur emfehlen ist und wir w√ºrden es jederzeit wieder buchen. :)",4,2013,11,07
30,Gutes Hotel am Stadtrand,Das Hotel entspricht 4 Sternen und hat sch√∂ne Zimmer. Die Lage ist f√ºr eine St√§dtreise noch in Orndnung. Man muss mit der Metro aber gut 30 Minuten bis in die City einplanen! Ein Shuttel vom Hotel f√§hrt morgens 2 mal und hat 13 Sitzpl√§tze (keine Reservierung!).

Le pecche?
Spa e palestra sono esterni e a pagamento. Scordatevi di partire dalla camera in accappatoio e ciabattine. Logisticamente una rottura perchÔøΩÔøΩ devi portare tutto l'occorrente per il cambio e la doccia. Ma una Palestrina e una sauna in uno qualsiasi degli oltre 30 piani disponibili no???
L'altra pecca ÔøΩÔøΩ la distanza dal centro. Da qui a piedi non si va da nessuna parte. In ogni caso con 10 min di taxi si arriva al cuore della cittÔøΩÔøΩ.",4,2013,10,11
30,Ottimo hotel,"Attraverso un coupon ho soggiornato 4 notti + colazione in quest'hotel fantastico ad un prezzo altrettanto fantastico: ottima esperienza. Il mio scopo era visitare Barcellona quindi non ho avuto molto tempo per godere delle comodit√† che mette a disposizione: ero al 20¬∞ piano vista su Barcellona eccezionale, camera bella e silenziosa, bagno bello con spazio wc separato. In camera offrono tutto: ciabattine, crema corpo, bagnoschiuma, spazzolino denti con dentifricio, rasoio con schiuma barba ecc., e quando finiscono prontamente li riassortiscono. Colazione superlativa, comprensiva di tutto, dolce e salato e di ottima qualit√†. L'hotel mette a disposizione dei propri ospiti, ad orari prestabiliti, un servizio navetta da e per l'aeroporto e da e per il centro citt√† (10 minuti per i relativi tragitti): comodissimo e permette di risparmiare sul metro. Una nota di merito all'autista della navetta sig.ra cordiale e simpaticissima! Nota di demerito la navetta ha solo 13 posti quindi si riempie velocemente, ma poco male la metro √® a 100 mt dall'hotel e in 20 minuti si arriva in centro.",5,2013,10,10

30,hotel fantastico,"Hotel favoloso: vi abbiamo soggiornato io e mio marito  per 5 giorni a fine agosto 2013. Abbiamo trovato un‚Äô offerta per cui abbiamo speso come per un tre stelle, naturalmente erano esclusi i pasti. Per chi ha un budget ridotto conviene fare i pasti fuori dall‚Äôhotel, infatti il caff√® al bar della recption costa ‚Ç¨ 5, la colazione circa ‚Ç¨25. La colazione si puo‚Äô fare uscendo dal‚Äô‚Äôalbergo ed andando verso destra dove ci sono alcuni negozi; c‚Äô√® un bar/forno dove con 2/3 euro si puo‚Äô fare colazione. Non fate colazione al centro di barcellona o vicino ai monumenti pi‚Äô famosi perch√© per 1 caff√®, 1 cappuccino e 2 cornetti vi staccano anche ‚Ç¨ 12.
Le stanze dell‚Äôalbergo sono grandi ed hanno una parete di vetro da cui potrete godere di uno stupendo panorama, pure dai piani piu‚Äô bassi. Nel bagno c‚Äô√® tutto l‚Äôoccorrente: phon. shampoo, bagnoschiuma, crema, saponetta, dentifricio con spazzolino, lametta con schiuma da barba, fazzolettini, cuffia per la doccia,‚Ä¶), vi dovete portare solo le pantofole.
Alla reception sono molto gentili, all‚Äôarrivo vi daranno diverse informazioni con cartina metro, escursioni,..
L' albergo ad orari prestabiliti offre gratuitamente un servizio di navetta da e per l‚Äôereoporto di barcellona, per il centro e per la spiaggia. Se gli orari vi sono comodi prendetelo perche‚Äô potete risparmiare i soldi della metro che costa ‚Ç¨2 per ogni singola corsa. Per la metro vi conviene compreare l‚Äôabbonamento t10 che vale per 10 corse e costa circa ‚Ç¨ 9.  
L' albergo e‚Äô un po‚Äô lontano dal centro, ma la fermata della metropolitana e‚Äô dall‚Äôaltra parte della strada (sono circa 200 metri): √® comodissima, si tratta della line ‚ÄúL‚Äù rossa e per tornare in albergo dovete scendere al capolinea, per cui non vi sbagliate! (controllate sempre se il senso di marcia da cui prendete la metro e‚Äô giusto). Non vi sbagliate con la linea rossa dei treni: le linee della metro sono indicate con la lettera ‚ÄúL‚Äù e vari colori, quelle dei treni sono indicate con la lettera‚ÄùR‚Äù ed i vari colori. Con la metro per andare dall‚Äôalbergo al centro si impiegano circa 20 minuti, mentre con il pulmino dell‚Äôalbergo ci si impiega solo circa 10 minuti (il conducente ci ha spiegato che essendo agosto non c‚Äôera traffico altrimenti e‚Äô un disastro). 
Non posso dare giudizi ne‚Äô sulla palestra, ne‚Äô sulla piscina e tantomeno sul centro benessere perche‚Äô purtroppo non abbiamo usufruito di questi servizi:per non perdere tempo e visitare il piu‚Äô possibile partivamo la mattina presto e tornavamo la sera tardi per dormire (per i vari musei, monumenti c‚Äôera tanta fila). Durante la settimana la metro chiude a mezzanotte, mentre nel fine settimana e‚Äô sempre aperta.

30,Sch√∂nes Hotel mit Luft nach Oben,"Hotel:
Das Hotel hat uns sehr gut gefallen, die Zimmer sind klasse, sehr sauber, klasse Service und eins der besten Fr√ºhst√ºcke die wir je erlebt haben!

Leider merkt man, dass es ein ""spanisches"" ""5-Sterne"" Hotel ist, denn es ist eine sch√∂ne Immobilie, es wurde jedoch nach Er√∂ffnung nicht mehr in das Hotel/ Renovierung/ Erhaltung investiert, so scheint es. Auch f√ºr 5 Sterne erwartet man etwas anderes. Es ist meines Erachtens eine gutes 4 Sterne Plus Hotel.

Restraurant:
Das Restaurant Azimut hat uns vom Service und vom Essen sehr gefallen! Leider auch hier wieder, keine Fugen mehr zwischen den Fliesen auf der Toilette, matte Spiegel, ausgeblichener gro√üer roter Teppich im Restaurant mit Stolper-Falten, verbogene Gabeln, dreckige Fensterfronten, die eigentlich so einfach zu beseitigen w√§ren, aber.....Spanien halt.

Wir wollten eigentlich im Restaurant ganz oben in diesem ""Ufo"" essen..., weswegen wir tats√§chlich auch das Hotel ausgew√§hlt hatten, dieses ist seit einem Jahr jedoch geschlossen und darf auch nicht angesehen werden...
Dies Bewerbung f√ºr das Restaurant bitte aus dem Internet entfernen.

Zusatzangebote:
Das Hotel verf√ºgt √ºber einen Spa/ Sauna/ Fitness/ Pool Bereich, den man f√ºr 14 ‚Ç¨ am Tag nutzen kann. Soll wohl sehr sch√∂n sein, waren wir aber nicht drin. Hmm, hier wieder die Frage in vier Sterne Hotels ist dies inklusive, warum hier nicht.
Also leider sind demzufolge zus√§tzliche Angebote nicht wirklich ""kostenlos"" enthalten.

Lage:
Das Hotel liegt im Westen von Barcelona. Ca. 8 Min. von der Metro Station entfernt und man kann direkt bis Catalunya durchfahren, dauert aber ca. 20-25 Min. die Fahrt. Also es liegt, gut erreichbar vom Flughafen auch, top! Und keine L√§rmbel√§stigung!

El Spa est√° muy chulo, y el servicio en general es perfecto. El desayuno un manjar con todo tipo de comidas variopintas, eso s√≠, es un poco caro.

Est√° lejos del centro, pero tiene una parada de metro al lado del hotel, y de autob√∫s tambi√©n (el que lleva al aeropuerto). Adem√°s el hotel tiene un autob√∫s a unas horas que te lleva al aeropuerto o al centro gratuitamente.

30,5 stelle con costi da 3,"Tra i tanti hotel  con cinque stelle dove ho soggiornato a Barcellona questo ha una caratteristica peculiare: i costi sono decisamente inferiori  a parit√† di categoria.

la nota negativa e' la sua ubicazione che si trova a meta' strada tra l'aeroporto e il centro della citta', comunque e' servito da taxi stazionanti 24 ore fuori dall'albergo ed una metropolitana a 200 metri di distanza che vi collega con tutta Barcellona",5,2013,07,20

Cena en el restaurante ""Bouquet"", muy bonito. La comida muy buena, el servicio excelente. Muy amables y competentes los camareros. El desayuno al d√≠a siguiente perfecto. Al mediod√≠a siguiente (ten√≠amos late check-out) fuimos al Club Tower (incluido en el paquete) donde te puedes auto-servir una copa o una bebida y picar algo.

El SPA (que pertenece al Metropolitan) es lo √∫nico que desmerece un poco a un hotel de tanta categor√≠a. Al ser un SPA de gimnasio no es muy rom√°ntico / exclusivo. Es lo √∫nico que le pondr√≠a alguna pega.",4,2013,06,20
30,Dise√±o incomodo,"Edificio se√±ero, camino del aeropuerto a Barna, reconocible por el""ovni"". De Convenci√≥n. Habitaci√≥n amplia con ba√±o incompleto (una man√≠a de los arquitectos esa de no dotar de todos los accesorios) abierto al pasillo, frecuente en NH. Ducha con instrucciones en la pared, fallo de dise√±o. Ascensores sin instrucciones, fallo de dise√±o, y poco eficaces para mover a grupos. Desayuno con oferta corta, en comparaci√≥n a la de otros hoteles de la misma cadena. Muebles del lobby absurdos, lo vistoso del dise√±o prima sobre la comodidad, sillas rompe espaldas y sillones que imp√≠den la incorporaci√≥n c√≥moda. Est√° lejos de la ciudad, necesitas 20 minutos m√≠nimo de desplazamiento. Te entregan la llave sin activar, un fallo frecuente.",2,2013,06,15

Lo reservamos porque cogimos una muy buena oferta,si ni hubi√©ramos optado por otro.Tiene una parada de metro muy cerca tambi√©n.",5,2013,06,04
30,Viaggio di Lavoro,"Ho pernottao per due notti in questo e il servizio √® stato impeccabile.
Il ristorante interno serve ottimi piatti.

A causa del poco tempo  a disposizione non ho potuto verificare i servizi interni.",4,2013,06,03
30,Excelente escapada rom√°ntica,"Fui a pasar una noche con mi pareja disfrutando del magn√≠fico pack rom√°ntico que ofrecen por 200‚Ç¨. Es un pack super completo: acceso al SPA del gimnasio Metropolitan, desayuno buffet, cena, cava, fresas, late check out hasta las 17h, acceso a la planta VIP, etc.

La estancia fue EXCELENTE. El desayuno buffet era super completo. No falt√≥ de nada. La cena exquisita en un muy buen restaurante, a pesar de tener que pagar las bebidas. La planta VIP era genial y la iban rellenando de manera constante. Las habitaciones tambi√©n excelentes.
El SPA no es propio del Hotel, si no del gimnasio Metropolitan. A pesar de, por tanto, no poder encontrar un momento de gran relax en el SPA por encontrarse masificado de los usuarios del gimnasio, era bastante completo y dispon√≠a de sauna, hammal, ducha de hielo, ducha de agua helada, camas de calor, y otras duchas tonificantes.
La habitaci√≥n era muy completa, acogedora y c√≥moda.

El servicio tambi√©n era excelente y en general eran muy atentos en todos los sentidos.

Quiz√°s lo peor sea su ubicaci√≥n, al encontrarse algo alejado del centro de Barcelona. No obstante, las comunicaciones son excelentes, pues el metro se encuentra a pocos metros, al igual que el ferrocarril, los autobuses o incluso los taxis.",5,2013,05,30
30,Poca variedad en los desayunos,"El hotel est√° bastante bien, con personal cualificado para un hotel de 5 estrellas, amable y educado.
Las habitaciones cumplen con todas las necesidades, con un estilo moderno, cosa que suelo apreciar bastante. El √∫nico ""pero"" que le pondr√≠a a la habitaci√≥n es que el suelo est√° enmoquetado.
Tiene dos defectos; el primero la ubicaci√≥n, ya que aunque tiene una parada de metro al lado, est√° bastante lejos del centro de la ciudad, con lo que si se pretende llegar un poco tarde no queda m√°s remedio que elegir otro medio de transporte, ya sea taxi o coche propio. En segundo lugar el desayuno, bastante simple y con poca variedad, cosa que no suele ocurrir en hoteles de esta categor√≠a.",3,2013,05,14
30,Esta bien,"Me gusto mucho este hotel, todo muy ordenado y limpio, el buffet muy amplio en desayuno con muy buena pinta. Lo que no me gusto fue una trabajadora de alli que su nombre era Eva fue un poco mal educada conmigo y para ser un hotel de 5 estrellas tendria que ser mas simpatica. pero por lp general todo estaba muy bien ",4,2013,05,07
30,Tolles Hotel am Stadtrand,"Sehr sch√∂nes und modernes Hotel. Freundliches Personal. Sch√∂ne und grosse Zimmer. Tolles Bad. Essen im Restaurant und Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet von sehr guter Qualit√§t. Gute Verkehrsanbindung, da die U-Bahn wenige Minuten entfernt ist. Die Linie 1 f√§hrt einen direkt ins Zentrum von Barcelona.

Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist super.Das Restaurant ist klasse. Man kann dort sehr gut essen. Ich hatte ein Zimmer im 18. Stock. mit einem sch√∂nen Ausblick. Zimmer sehr sauber. Ein Nachteil ist, dass man die Fenster nicht √∂ffnen kann. Guter Schlafkomfort.",4,2013,04,27
30,Dipende da cosa si vuole fare.....,"Effettivamente gran bel hotel, ammetto di essere stato conquistato dalle immagini viste su internet e ho voluto provare, riassumerei in tutto con PANORAMA STUPENDO. Ebbene si, non √® l' hotel fantastico, ma la vista che si apprezza dalle stanze, specie le pi√π alte. Io ho soggiornato per tre notti al ventesimo piano e vi assicuro che lo spettacolo non √® da poco, giorno o notte che sia; ho avuto fortuna e la mia finestra dava sia verso il mare che la citt√†! Per il resto tutto nella norma, niente di indimenticabile, stanze grandi, pulite, personale gentile, colazione internazionale abbondante. A pochi passi dalla metro che in circa 20 min vi porta in centro, non scomodissimo ma neanche ideale per turismo. Superconsigliato per chi ""la vuole stupire"", una buona idea sarebbe soggiornare in centro, in posti pi√π economici e sicuramente pi√π comodi e perch√© no....la ultima notte alla Torre prima di tornare in Italia, grande Barcellona!!!!",3,2013,04,23
30,Sch√∂nes Hotel in uninteressanter Lage,"Dieses Hotel hat mich sehr angenehm √ºberrascht. Die Lage ist zwar nicht ideal, aber alles andere ja! Der Anblick von au√üen ist sehr spannend und futuristisch. Die Panoramafenster in meinem Zimmer lie√üen einen Superausblick zu. Trotz der N√§he zum Flughafen und zum Autobahnkreuz hatte ich eine angenehme Ruhe im Zimmer. Gew√∂hnungsbed√ºrftig ist die Fahrt mit dem Lift, sofern man an H√∂henangst leidet. Aber auch sehr beeindruckend. Die Restaurantleistungen (morgens und abends) waren ausgezeichnet, sowie Speisen, Getr√§nke als auch Service. Ich bin rundherum zufrieden gewesen.",5,2013,04,19
30,En medio de la nada,"Un buen hotel, pero lejos de la playa lejos del centro de Barcelona.Es cierto que al lado hay parada de metro.  Es un hotel de lujo pero no tiene piscina, aunque si tiene un Spa,   el desayuno falla un poco por su poca variedad.  Las habitaciones son correctas funcionales y con dise√±o muy actual. 
Esta cerrado el restaurant situado en la cupula.",4,2013,04,16
30,Hotel Tower Hesperia,"Ho visitato per una seconda volta Barcellona. L'agenzia di viaggi mi ha consigliato di soggiornare presso questo hotel. Le 5 stelle le vale tutte, d'altronde siamo stati sistemati io e la mia famiglia (4 persone) in vere e proprie suite vicino all'hotel. Preferisco gli hotel antichi e classici, tuttavia non √® un occasione da perdere, √® dotato di super tecnologia.

30,Buen Hotel!,"La verdad muy buen hotel, las habitaciones eran grandes comparadas con las de todo europa, el personal muy servicial, el unico defecto que existe es que esta muy lejos de plaza catlunya (que es el centro de la ciudad), sin embrago existe un shuttle por parte del hotel que te lleva y te trae a plaza catalunya, te haces como 15 min de la plaza a el hotel.",5,2013,04,14
30,Paquete rom√°ntico,"Fuimos a este hotel con un paquete rom√°ntico. Nos gust√≥ la experiencia. Las habitaciones ejecutivas son √°mplias y c√≥modas, botella de cava, fresas con chocolate, vistas de Barcelona iluminada. Puedes hacer uso del club metropolitan al cual se puede acceder desde el mismo hotel. Tambi√©n tienes acceso al Tower Club donde tomar una copa o picar alguna cosa sin cargo. 
La cena que incluye el paquete es en el restaurante Bouquet en la 2¬™ planta es correcta, si bien hay que a√±adirle un vino 20-50 ‚Ç¨
Buena experiencia para repetir.",5,2013,04,06
30,Lussuoso e moderno,"L'albergo in cui io e mia moglie abbiamo soggiornato per 3 giorni √® sicuramente molto funzionale e di alta qualit√†.
Il personale √® molto gentile e disponibile e il fatto che parlino anche l'italiano ci √® stato molto utile.
La cucina √® tra le migliori e i camerieri preparati e cortesi.
L'unica pecca, se vogliamo essere pignoli, √® quella della funzionalit√† delle camere.Infatti appena si entra in una di queste ci si ritrova in pratica nel bagno, in quanto non esiste una parete divisoria tra ingresso e servizi.
La doccia, in compenso, √® fantastica.Sicuramente la migliore mai utilizzata.
Meglio se si prenota la colazione in reception in quanto si risparmia sul prezzo.
La navetta che collega l'hotel all'aeroporto risulta inclusa nel pacchetto, ma in realt√† √® un costo aggiuntivo che risulta poi sul conto finale.Ve lo possiamo assicurare.
L'albergo √® ottimamente collegato alla citt√† grazie alla metropolitana che ha la fermata a 5 minuti. All'aeroporto √® collegato con il bus n¬∞46 che si prende all'uscita del terminal 2 e con i taxi, che non mancano mai.",4,2013,04,05

Die Zimmer und B√§der sind sehr ger√§umig und bieten teilweise einen phantastischen Blick. U-Bahnhof vor der T√ºr, 20 Minuten ins Zentrum. Wir haben uns sehr wohlgef√ºhlt.

30,MODERNISSIMO HOTEL,"Ho soggiornato in questo ottimo hotel per l'ultimo dell'anno, l'hotel √® bellissimo nuovo, molto moderno, camera pulitissima e doccia con idromassaggio da urlo, (ideale dopo una giornata passata a camminare tra il centro fantastico di Barcellona) personale indifferente, direi non gentile, colazione da non fare in hotel euro 25,00, molto servito dalla linea metropolitana a due minuti a piedi, per raggiungere il centro circa 15 minuti di metro', altrimenti si pu√≤ prendere un taxi prezzo circa 15 euro, ritornare sicuramente,",5,2013,03,13
30,"Viel Platz, modernes Design und gute Flughafenanbindung","Durch die hohe freistehende Bauweise ist das Hotel von weitem gut erkennbar, was gerade bei der Anreise vom Flughafen (falls √∂ffentlich) sehr von Vorteil ist. Das Hotel bietet einen kostenlosen Hotelshuttle. Sp√§ter abends oder auch generell tags√ºber kann man auch mit dem Bus f√ºr 2 EUR das Hotel gut vom Flughafen aus erreichen (Buslinie 46 oder Nachts N17). 

Das Hotel ist sehr futuristisch eingerichtet, besticht durch tolles Design mit viel warmen Holzt√∂nen. Die Zimmer haben ein sehr ansprechendes Entre mit einem offenen Bad mit vielen Spiegeln und viel Licht und dunklen warmen T√∂nen. Man f√ºhlt sich sofort geborgen zu Hause, obwohl nichts an zu Hause erinnert, aber das viele Licht und Spiegel und Holzt√∂ne tuen ihr √ºbriges.
Die U-Bahn ist 200m entfernt Endhaltestelle Hospital del Bellvitge.

Der Blick auf viele Lichter am Horizont ist wirklich sehr sch√∂n, auch wenn man nicht erahnen kann, dass es sich um Barcelona am Horizont handelt. Das Bad hat ein separates WC und eine separate Dusche jeweils ausgestattet mit indirektem Licht. Zudem verf√ºgt die Dusche √ºber Spr√ºhd√ºsen f√ºr eine kleine Massage beim Duschen. (Hier sei gesagt, dass man wirklich erst die Anleitung beachten sollte bevor man aufdreht :-) der Spr√ºher kann ins Auge gehen :-P )
Die Betten sind sehr sehr sehr bequem :-)

Bei Lastminute.de gab es das Hotel zum Spitzenpreis f√ºr 70 EUR pro Zimmer und Nacht ohne Fr√ºhst√ºck und das war wirklich ein toller Preis.",4,2013,03,09
30,lusso e gentilezza,"siamo stati io mia moglie e la nostra bambina all'Hesperia tower dal 2 al 6 gennaio 2013. L'hotel si trova fuori citt√† a circa 7 km dal centro e 10 km dall'aeroporto (che viene servito da una navetta gratuita). A circa 300m vi √® la fermata della metro 1 Hospital de Bellvitge che porta incentro in circa 20 minuti. Vi √® anche una navetta gratuita per il centro a orari prestabiliti.L'hotel √® una torre di circa 30 piani in stile moderno. La hall √® modernissima ampia e con un design straordinario. Il personale √® gentile, professionale e sempre a disposizione. La nostra camera era una suite lussuosa, pulita, con tutti i confort possibili e immaginabili (grazie a HOTELTRAVEL.com a cui avevamo richiesto una camera doppia con una bambina supplementare ho pagato soltanto per una doppia). La colazione √® abbondante, squisita e si propone per tutte le esigenze. Nel complesso un soggiorno sublime. Se c'√® una pecca che √® un po' lontano dal centro. La sera si ritornava in taxi con circa 16‚Ç¨.",5,2013,03,08
30,Espectacular hotel,"Cogimos el hotel para la partida y la llegada de un viaje, escogimos el hotel por la cercan√≠a al aeropuerto y porque parec√≠a espectacular, y as√≠ es.
Entrada espectacular, instalaciones a la √∫ltima, unas habitaciones grandes, con todo tipo de detalles y de dise√±o.
Desayuno muy completo y perfecto, hasta nos supo a poco el hecho de estar solo por el motivo del otro viaje y no poder disfrutar m√°s d√≠as de este fant√°stico hotel.
El personal muy amable y atento. Repetir√© sin duda.",5,2013,02,22
30,Mala experiencia en el restaurante Bouquet,"Me llev√≥ mi chico a cenar por San Valent√≠n al restaurante Bouquet ubicado en este hotel. El maitre nos hizo pasar a nuestra mesa y pedimos una Cocacola y a los 2 minutos, la carta de vinos, de los cuales escogemos una botella de 25 euros y adem√°s agua. Todo esto se lo pedimos al maitre, que rezumaba amabilidad y exquisitez. Al cabo de unos 20 minutos, empiezan a llegar los platos (aperitivos, primero, 2 segundos, postre y dulces).
El vino no apareci√≥ hasta ya servido el primero (y porque nos pregunt√≥ otro camarero si faltaba algo y se lo recordamos). Nos rellen√≥ las dos copas de vino y, en lugar de dejarnos la botella con la cubitera al lado de la mesa, se la llev√≥.
Nos pregunt√≥ si quer√≠amos agua, le dijimos que s√≠, y nos rellen√≥ los vasos de agua que ten√≠amos en la mesa con una botella de Evian que ten√≠a abierta en la cubitera. M√°s de lo mismo.
La comida buen√≠sima, no tengo quejas, El postre fue lo que menos me gust√≥, me sab√≠a a tarta de queso cuando se trataba de chocolate blanco con frambuesa.
La sorpresa vino al pedir la cuenta. Estando sentados en la mesa pedimos que nos cobren. Pasaron como unos 15 minutos y, viendo que nadie nos tra√≠a la cuenta, nos levantamos con la intenci√≥n de ir a pagar en caja. Justo en ese momento, el camarero nos trae la cuenta y luego va a buscar el dat√°fono, pues pagamos con tarjeta. Pagamos, nos da el ticket, nos levantamos y, al salir, pasamos por caja donde estaba el maitre tan amable, y nos despedimos. √âste se encontraba en plena discusi√≥n con una pareja extranjera que quer√≠a entrar a pesar de estar la cocina cerrada (¬øqu√© cenar√≠a entonces toda la gente que hab√≠a venido m√°s tarde que nosotros y que, en el momento de irnos, a lo mejor estaba por el primer plato?). Nada m√°s ver que nos march√°bamos, nos llam√≥ la atenci√≥n diciendo ""Un momento se√±ores, me tienen que firmar una cosa"". Nosotros extra√±ados vamos para all√°. Nos dice que le tenemos que pagar la cuenta y que si estamos hospedados en el hotel (para cargar el importe en la habitaci√≥n). Nosotros nos miramos, y le decimos que ya hemos pagado. El ""simp√°tico"" maitre echa una mirada a los papeles que ten√≠a en caja delante suyo y nos dice que √©l no tiene ni ticket ni nada. Nosotros le decimos que el camarero ha venido con el dat√°fono a la mesa. El ""buen hombre"" sigue diciendo que a √©l no le consta. Hasta que no le sacamos el ticket y el resguardo del dat√°fono no dio su brazo a torcer, esboz√≥ un simple ""Les pido disculpas"" y hala.
Nos vamos, algo decepcionados por lo que hab√≠a pasado, y al volver a casa nos da por mirar el ticket, que paso a desglosar:
- 2 men√∫s de San Valent√≠n, a 35 euros cada uno (cuando mi pareja lo reserv√≥ a 33 euros cada uno)
- 2 caf√©s, a 4 euros cada uno (y s√≥lo tom√© caf√© yo, mi chico no tom√≥)
- una botella de 75 cl de agua Evian a 7 euros (nos rellenaron 2 vasos con una botella ya abierta y que no volvimos a ver en toda la noche)
- una botella de vino de 25 euros (del vino s√≥lo nos rellenaron la copa la primera vez y tampoco volvimos a ver la botella, cuando se supone que te la dejan en una cubitera junto a la mesa)
- un vaso de Cocacola (tampoco vi lata o botella alguna) 4,25 euros.

Total 114 euros

Conclusi√≥n --> Sitio muy bonito, decoraci√≥n incre√≠ble, comida exquisita. Maitre prepotente, lento, olvidadizo y, adem√°s, que no sabe organizarse a la hora de cobrar (deber√≠a haber sabido que un camarero nos trajo el dat√°fono a la mesa, y luego no montarnos el numerito de ""os ibais sin pagar""). Lo que pretend√≠a ser una velada inolvidable acabo si√©ndolo pero por motivos bien distintos. No pienso volver.",2,2013,02,17
30,Modernes Top-Hotel,"Wer modernes Design mag, ist hier bestens aufgehoben. Top-Hotel zwischen Flughafen und Stadtzentrum mit sehr eindrucksvoller Lobby und Bar und viel High-Tech. Das Personal ist √ºberaus freundlich, der Service ist exzellent. Die Zimmer in dem √ºber 100 m hohen Turm sind modern und sehr ansprechend eingerichtet, inklusive WLAN. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist sehr gut, reichhaltige Auswahl, u.a. auch an Kaffeespezialit√§ten. Auch hier ist der Service sehr freundlich. Dem Hotel ist ein sehr gutes Fitness- und Wellness-Zentrum angeschlossen, sehr empfehlenswert. Das Hotelrestaurant ist modern und sehr ansprechend eingerichtet - gute Qualit√§t der Speisen und sehr guter Service, allerdings ist es auch etwas teuer. Manko des Hotels ist die Lage - in der n√§heren Umgebung gibt es so wie nichts an Caf√©s, Restaurants etc. Das Hotel bietet 2 x pro Tag einen kostenlosen Shuttle-Service (10Min) ins Zentrum an, mit der nahe gelegenen U-Bahn ben√∂tigt man ca. 25 Minuten bis in die Stadt.  Zum nahe gelegenen Flughafen gibt es ebenfalls einen kostenlosen Shuttle-Service. - Ich habe mich in diesem Hotel SEHR wohl gef√ºhlt!",4,2013,02,16

Alg√∫n desperfecto en la tapa del inodoro pero ser√≠a ponerse muy quisquilloso. El desayuno igualmente magn√≠fico, buena calidad aunque quiz√°s un poco corto de variedad, sobre todo los calientes. Personal un 10 en trato y amabilidad.

Como √∫nica pega encuentro la situaci√≥n (lejos del centro, es quiz√°s m√°s un hotel de congresos que uno para hacer turismo).

Muy curioso el sistema de ascensores, si vais sabr√©is por qu√©.",5,2013,02,14
30,Hotel di lusso con vista su Barcellona,"Sono stato in questo hotel per una riunione di lavoro. Anche se per i miei gusti √® troppo lussuoso, devo ammettere che la vista sulla citt√† e sulle colline √® stupenda. Dal 18¬∞ piano, lato nord non ho potuto vedere bene il mare. La colazione √® veramente completa di tutto quanto si possa desiderare con varie macchine nespresso self service molto simpatiche. Le sale per riunioni del centro congressi non hanno sempre mantenuto le aspettative in quanto la climatizzazione funzionava male, nonostante fosse la fine di gennaio. Il ristorante Azimut al 4¬∞ piano mi ha lasciato un ricordo abbastanza neutro, anche a causa di due cene a menu prestabilito.
Non avendo pagato il conto non posso esprimermi sul rapporto qualit√† prezzo. Certo l'anticamera della mia stanza con guardaroba e bagno molto grandi, tutti in marmo (o equivalente sintetico) nero, fanno un grande effetto, come il divano davanti ad una ampissima finestra sulla citt√†. Non ho mai acceso la televisione ma ho apprezzato la radiosveglia Philips con dock per Iphone/ipod. La fermata della metro a 50 metri dall'hotel √® davvero comoda, ce n'√® un'altra a qualche centinaio di metri dal lato opposto. Occorre anche dire che l'hotel √® lontano dal centro citt√†. Una nota sul sistema di ascensori: da sconsigliare a chi non ama la tecnologia touch screen. L'impianto di condizionamento nelle camera √® abbastanza rumoroso.",4,2013,02,09

Parking perfecto pero caro 24‚Ç¨. Muy pr√≥ximo al metro, adem√°s tienen navets al centro y al aeropuerto. La relaci√≥n calidad precio es excepcional, aunque est√© un poco mal ubicado.",4,2012,10,29
30,Una opci√≥n muy interesante en Barcelona,"Aunque el hotel est√° situado a las afueras de Barcelona, concretamente en Hospitalet, se tarda no m√°s de 15 minutos en coche en llegar a la Plaza de Catalu√±a. Y a cambio tienes un magn√≠fico hotel de 5 estrellas a un precio realmente bueno. El desayuno es fant√°stico, muy completo y con una gran variedad y calidad. Otro punto fuerte del hotel son sus vistas, especialmente si la habitaci√≥n est√° orientada hacia Barcelona.
Nos preocupaba su ubicaci√≥n, pero para nada supuso un problema. Dejamos el coche en el parking durante toda nuestra estancia y nos movimos en taxi. Hay una parada de taxi junto a la salida del hotel y nunca nos cost√≥ m√°s de 14 euros el viaje hasta la Plaza de Catalu√±a (o el regreso al hotel).
En general todo muy bien pero por decir algo que puede mejorarse, dir√© que la limpieza en algunos rincones debe esmerarse, al igual que la impermeabilizaci√≥n de la mampara de la ducha, ya que sal√≠a algo de agua. No obstante, la nota general es muy alta y la relaci√≥n calidad precio inmejorable.",4,2012,10,29
30,BUEN HOTEL PERO FRIO IMPERSONAL,"hotel muy bueno pero no acogedor,dise√±o impresionante,pero trato con el cliente atento pero muy frio,tuvimos un peque√±o incidente nos asignaron una habitacion y al llegar a ella no estaba lista todavia,tuvimos que bajar a recepcion y nos dieron otra al momento pero es un detalle que no puede pasar en un un hotel de 5 estrlelllas,buffet desayuno completo y variado pero el zumo de naranja no es natural,fallo en un hotel de 5 estrellas.",4,2012,10,21
30,OK,"Das Hotel sieht von au√üen aus wie ein Raumschiff, aber das ist wohl Geschmackssache. Wir waren sehr entt√§uscht das man f√ºr die Spa 12 Euro pro Person extra zahlen muss, auch wenn man nur mal schnell ein paar Bahnen schwimmen m√∂chte. Auch sind die Getr√§nke an der Bar im Hotel sehr teuer. Das Hotel liegt sehr weit au√üerhalb der Stadt, man braucht ca. 30 Minuten mit der Metro. Die Zimmer sind sehr sch√∂n und gro√ü, bis auf den Teppich, der schon etwas alt und schmutzig ist. Wir w√ºrden n√§chstesmal ein anderes Hotel buchen.",2,2012,10,01
30,prima volta a Barcellona,"Abbiamo soggiornato per 5 notti in questo hotel in due camere, devo dire che sia per la dimensione, che per la pulizia che per i servizi le stanze erano come visto sul sito, notevoli. Comodo il servizio navetta per il centro citta', infatti la posizione dell'albergo e' abbastanza decentrata, anche se vicinissima al capolinea della linea rossa della metropolitana. Struttura di grande fascino con ascensori avveniristici ed una hall grandissima oltre che comodissima ....
Note di merito per la grandissima doccia con idromassaggio (in ogni camera) e per la gentilezza del personale della reception.
Note di demerito: il costo della colazione .... e la piscina chiusa ....",5,2012,09,24
30,Ottimo Hotel,"Siamo stati a Barcellona a fine giugno 2012 ed abbiamo soggiornato presso questa struttura.
Hotel molto bello, a due passi dalla metropolitana ( la fermata √® per√≥ una delle ultime delle linea, non siamo in centro!).
Le camere sono molto belle e pulite, dotate di tutto quello che serve.
√à possibile anche accedere a prezzi molto convenienti alla palestra ( non abbiamo fruito per√≥ della palestra per cui non possiamo dire altro).
Colazione e pranzo invece sono da dimenticare! La colazione √® costosissima (16 euro) mentre per quanto riguarda il pranzo, non sappiamo se buono o no, sappiamo per√≥ che era costoso, per cui a Barcellona √® meglio mangiare paella e tapas fuori!!",4,2012,09,23
30,"Casi s√≠, pero no en los detalles.","Es una buena opci√≥n, con alg√∫n pero. Mientras las instalaciones son impresionantes, el dise√±o fant√°stico y muchas comodidades y lujos, el personal vive aislado del contacto con el cliente. Puedes entrar o salir y nadie se entera, lo que favorecer√≠a tambi√©n a las visitas ""no deseadas"".
Existe una lanzadera que te traslada al centro de Barcelona o al aeropuerto, pero salvo que preguntes por transporte... nada puedes adivinar.
Tuvimos un peque√±o incidente, porque al mover las botellas del minibar para colocar fruta me quer√≠an cargar unas consumiciones (sensores a distancia). La persona que repuso dos botellines por la ma√±ana ¬øno vio que no hab√≠a ning√∫n hueco? Pues coloc√≥ las dos botellas donde pudo y no dijo que se hab√≠a producido un error.
Tampoco se puede comprender que desde primer√≠sima hora de la ma√±ana la camarera de la planta se dedique a dar portazos a la puerta de acceso de su material, que estaba junto a la puerta de mi dormitorio. Estaba en el piso 10.
Por lo dem√°s, un hotel de lujo y con unas vistas impresionantes a pocos minutos del centro m√°s barato que un 2-3 estrellas del centro donde adem√°s tienes que pagar parking porque no tienes donde dejar el coche...
La buena comunicaci√≥n con el centro de Barcelona te permite pasar el d√≠a de visitas y salir a √©ste remanso de tranquilidad en las afueras.
Otro pero ¬øno pueden poner el espacio para ""los fumatas"" fuera de la misma puerta de acceso al hotel? ¬°Llama mucho la atenci√≥n pasar con las maletas entre personas que est√°n charlando con el cigarrillo en la mano!",4,2012,09,11
30,OTTIMO RAPPORTO QUALITA' - PREZZO,"Premetto che vivo in Italia ma sono nata a Barcellona e ho tutta la famiglia l√¨. Viaggio quindi spesso a Barcellona per andar a trovare la famiglia. Di solito vado a dormire a casa dei miei, ma quando trovo l'offerta su questo albergo, prendo l'occasione al volo. L'abergo √® vicino all'aeroporto (quindi molto comodo se si arriva tardi con i voli Ryanair). Appena si esce dall'aeroporto c'√® la fermata dell'autobus 46 e con il prezzo di una normale corsa di autobus si arriva con pochissime fermate (mi sembra 2) all'hotel. Bisogna scendere a Hospital Oncol√≤gic. La fermata √® sulla Gran Via (si vede l'albergo di fronte). Basta attraversare la Gran Via con il sottopasaggio e arrivate in albergo. Le camere sono molto belle, hanno tutti i confort e accessori (ciabatte, dentifricio, creme, accappatoio ecc.) Io chiedo sempre, durante la fase di prenotazione, se possono darmi una camera in un piano alto e con veduta su Barcellona (ci sono anche quelle con veduta sull'altra parte, meno belle). Mi hanno sempre accontentato. E' uno spettacolo!
Per andare a Barcellona centro con la metro ci si mette molto poco e per ritornare in aeroporto, sempre sulla Gran Via ferma il 46.  Lo consiglio perch√® √® bellissimo e se lo trovate a prezzo in offerta (io di solito su lastminute.com in top secret hotels) ne vale davvero la pena.",5,2012,09,10
30,LEJOS DEL CENTRO PERO EXCELENTE EN COMODIDAD E INSTALACIONES,"Este lujoso Hotel de 5 estrellas, est√° en Hospitalet, lejos de casi todas partes. No obstante es un hotel fant√°stico. Las habitaciones son grandes, muy bien decoradas, acogedoras y limpias. El ba√±o es espectacular, con una ducha fant√°stica. El armario es en realidad un minivestidor, con mucho espacio para colocar la ropa de forma ordenada.
Este Hotel est√° perfectamente preparado para la organizaci√≥n de eventos de trabajo, con una gran cantidad de salones perfectamente equipados.
El desayuno es estupendo , muy variado, con ingredientes de calidad y una presentaci√≥n impecable, como cabe esperar en los Hoteles de esta Cadena ( NH )",5,2012,09,05
30,favoloso,"sono stato in questo favoloso hotel a fine giugno....sono stato benissimo....l'hotel √® fantastico.....lussuoso....hall pazzesca, camere spaziose e molto belle.....posizione buona, a qualche metro c'√® la metro, e comunque √® collegata con autobus per l'aeroporto...
sono stato veramente bene ;)",5,2012,09,03
30,favoloso,"splendido hotel: estremamente pulito ed elegante. Lo stile √® moderno fatto e accogliente, le camere sono silenziose e dotate di tutti i servizi e confort anche nella loro versione standard: tv, wif-fi free, frigobar, cabina armadio, bagno con doccia emozionale e massaggiante.
pur essendo periferico √® molto comodo perch√© la fermata capolinea della metro 1 √® a 20 metri nel parcheggio antistante.",5,2012,08,31
30,QUALCHE PROBLEMA DI GESTIONE,"√à una bellissima struttura, modernissima e avveniristica ma con evidenti segnali di problematiche gestionali. Il famoso ristorante EVO al 29esimo piano, inspiegabilmente chiuso (e non per ferie), la piscina inagibile. Poca informazione dal personale. Rifacimento della camere nel tardo pomeriggio. Peccato perch√®, seppur fuori mano, ma con 12/15 il servizio taxi ti porta tranquillamente al centro di Barcellona, potrebbe ottenere risultalti di soddifazione migliori, come ho avuto modo di leggere qui da altre recensioni. ",3,2012,08,12
30,Fantastico Hotel,"Siamo andati a Maggio dal 15 al 20 a Barcellona in vacanza io e mia moglie ed abbiamo scelto questo hotel ch√® √® un vero 5 stelle. L' ambiente  molto raffinato, le camere spaziose e pulite, dotate di ogni comfort ma soprattutto silenziosissime. Bellissima la vista sulla citt√†. Da provare il ristorante EVO al 29¬∞ piano con una vista mozzafiato su Barcellona il cibo √® di ottima qualit√†. Personale cordiale e molto disponibile. Purtroppo l'Hotel √® un po lontano dal centro ma √® molto ben servito: infatti la fermata della metropolitana √® solo a 2 minuti a piedi ed √® dotato di bus navetta gratuito messo a disposizione dall'hotel ( servizio offerto anche per l'aeroporto ).
Il prezzo vale decisamente la qualit√† di questo hotel. 
Consigliatissimo.",5,2012,08,07
30,Buen hotel pero lejos de todo.,"El hotel tiene unas buenas instalaciones, pero est√° lejos de todo (tiendas, restaurantes, etc)
La atenci√≥n por parte del de los empleados del hotel es muy buena, si el presupuesto es bajo tienes el metro Bellvitge a 200 metros",4,2012,08,07
30,5 stelle,"Vado al sodo senza troppi preamboli.
PRO: elegante, piacevole, pulito. Interessanti sue parti in comune che i bagni nelle camere. Vista dalle camere meravigliosa!
CONTRO: non proprio vicino al centro anche se ben servito, i dettagli dovrebbero essere curati meglio come ad esempio le prese elettriche il cui blocco si stacca dal muro.",5,2012,07,22
30,Ottimo albergo,L'hotel e bello ma l'unica pecca e la posizione... Se fosse vicino al centro potrebbe chiedere anche 500 euro... Cmq e un ottimo albergo vicino alla metro il tempo di una sigaretta e ci si arriva!!! ,5,2012,07,10
30,Vistas increibles,"Las suites son increibles, en el ba√±o puedes perderte de lo grande que es. Con un yaquzzi gigante.
El servicio de habitaciones es excelente y servicial, y las vistas desde el restaurante de la torre son de vertigo.",5,2012,07,04
30,Estancia NH,"No puedo mas que estar agradecida; sin problemas de ninguna clase; no tuve ocasion de comer-cenar en alguno de sus restaurantes por motivo simplemente de tiempo, en la proxima lo har√© aunque los foros sean muy distintos. El estar entre el centro de la ciudad y el aeropuerto facilita para un desconocido-turista todo, mas cuando nos otorgan el servicio de enlace ""charter"" (no recuerdo el nombre que emplean) y dado que es la primera cara que tenemos del Hotel, fant√°stica.",5,2012,06,29
30,Sehr modernes Hotel mit toller Aussicht,"Das Hotel ist sehr modern ausgestattet und bietet tolle Zimmer mit Blick auf Barcelona, einem sehr gro√üem Bad mit begehbarem Kleiderschrank und Regenfalldusche. Auch sonst hatte das Zimmer alles zu bieten was man braucht inkl. kostenfreiem W-Lan. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck konnten wir am Tag vorher zu 16 Euro dazubuchen (ohne Reservierung am Vortag kostet es 24 ‚Ç¨). Hier hat es an nichts gefehlt und auch der Service war schnell und sehr zuvorkommend, wie auch an der Rezeption. Zwar liegt das Hotel nicht im Zentrum, aber mit dem kostenlosen Shuttle zur Innenstadt und zum Flughafen bietet es einen guten zus√§tzlichen Service und zudem kann man problemlos und g√ºnstig in 20 Minuten mit der Metro zur Plaza Catalunya fahren. Die Metrostation befindet sich auch direkt vor dem Hotel. Insgesamt kann ich das Hesperia Tower sehr empfehlen.",5,2012,06,29
30,Sehr gutes Business mit viel liebe zum Deatil,"Das Personal im Hotel war sehr zuvorkommend. Die Einrichtung war sehr sch√∂n/stylisch. Die Gastronomie war ebenfalls sehr gut. F√ºr einen privaten Barcelona-Urlaub w√§re es mir zu weit vom Stadt-Zentrum entfernt, wobei es aber einen kostenlosen Shuttle-Service vom Hotel gibt. Insgesamt wirklich empfehlenswert!",4,2012,06,28
30,Un hotel estupendo pero mal ubicado,"Nos hospedamos recientemente en este hotel para pasar un par de dias en Barcelona. El hotel es una maravilla. Hubo un problema en el sistema del hotel y parecia que habia problemas con la reserva, pero la gente de la recepcion gestiono todo bastante bien. 
La habitacion es bastante grande y con todas las comodidas. Tiene un ba√±o muy amplio y muy comodo. Las vistas desde la planta 10 son increibles, gracias a su inmensa cristalera. 
El hotel dispone de piscina y SPA pero no esta en el mismo hote, hay que andar unos metros. 
Como unica pega, la ubicacion. El Hotel se encuentra al lado del hospital de Bellvitge (hospitalet). Al acceder con el coche nos costo un poco pero no tiene demasiada perdida. 
Lo bueno es que junto al hospital hay una parada de metro de la linea L1 (de hecho el hospital es la ultima parada), y en 20 minutos te deja en plaza catalu√±a (perfecto para no usar el coche). 
Es una excelente opcion para ir a Barcelona y difrutar de todas las comodidades de un gran hotel.",5,2012,06,28
30,Muy bueno aunque alejado,"El hotel es estupendo, yo estuve en una ampl√≠sima habitaci√≥n, con un ba√±o enorme. No faltaba de nada, albornoz, zapatillas, doble lavabo... muy completo. El desayuno tambi√©n bastante variado, aunque pillamos con una abalancha de gente, y era un poco agobiante. El personal del restaurante muy atento. Lo peor de todo es que hasta el centro de barcelona se tarda al menos media hora en metro.",4,2012,06,26
30,Hotel Moderno y Agradable,"El hotel est√° frente al Hospital deOncologia de Barcelona, con un buen acceso por carretera, paracon muy bida del metro a 300 metros, confortable, muy moderno,con muy buenos servicios, excelente relaci√≥n calidad precio",4,2012,06,15
30,Excelentes instalaciones,"Excelente hotel con excelentes instalaciones y vistas.
Hall-recepci√≥n muy amplio y luminoso. Muy bonito, con barra y muchas opciones para descanso.
Habitaciones amplias y c√≥modas. Con tv, minibar, base para ipod, sof√° y mesa escritorio. Cortinas autom√°ticas (una vez cerradas, colocar a mano para evitar peque√±as rendijas de luz matinal). Ba√±os amplios con vestidor. Zona de ducha independiente con chorros. Mucha limpieza en todas las instalaciones. Habitaciones con vistas hacia Barcelona o hacia el hospital de Bellvitge-aeropuerto.
Parking en el mismo edificio. pero posibilidad de aparcamiento gratuito al aire libre en los alrededores.
Facilitan acceso a plaza catalunya en autobus propio. Estaci√≥n de metro en la puerta del hospital (400 metros y 20 minutos al centro). Parada de bus a 300 metros (tiempo al centro no menos de 20 minutos seg√∫n el tr√°fico). Cualquier opci√≥n no es muy buena debido a la lejan√≠a respecto al centro de Barcelona.
Para ir a Gran V√≠a 2 no es f√°cil ir caminando. La mejor opci√≥n es coger el autobus al cruzar la Gran V√≠a.
Para ir al aeropuerto est√° a escasa distancia y bien comunicado.
Desayunos buffet extraordinarios pero han bajado la calidad y variedad desde la apertura. 
Restaurante EVO excepcional para darse un capricho.
Lo peor es que a pesar de las 5*, tiene peque√±os detalles que le rebajan la puntuaci√≥n: un solo juego de zapatillas para dos personas, falta de reposici√≥n en amenities, acabados y remates de las instalaciones (puertas ralladas, esquinas y juntas de los ba√±os sucias pos la silicona mal puesta, no reposici√≥n de minibar,...).",5,2012,05,27
30,Muy buena opci√≥n cerca de Barcelona,"Acabamos de pasar el fin de semana en el Hesperia Tower, el hotel es excelente, las habitaciones standards geniales, con todo tipo de detalles, el ba√±o precioso, e integrado el closet dentro del mismo espacio, lo cual es muy c√≥modo. Pero lo mejor las vistas desde las habitaciones a Barcelona. El desayuno de muy buena calidad y muchis√≠ma variedad, y el trato del personal muy bueno, muy amables. Wi-fi gratuito en las habitaciones, es una muy buena opci√≥n si quieres estar alojado cerca del aeropuerto,y si no te importa estar a 5 minutos de la ciudad. Repeter√≠a seguro.",4,2012,05,27
30,restaurante bouquet,"Dia 21/5/12, llego al restaurante y en la recepcion una se√±orita, sumida en sus facturas, la molesto y pregunto si podemos comer, somos 2, nos dice que si , baja la cabeza y sigue en sus facturas sin hacernos caso, al cabo de cuatro minutos nos hace pasar a una mesa,  alli el primer camarero o maitre que se acerca es diez minutos mas tarde nos pasa cartas y pregunta bebidas, una coca cola y una copa de vino tinto,  la coca cola la traen pero el vino no,al cabo de otro cuarto de hora nos toman nota, pedimos una esqueixada, bacalao llauna,y una pasta que tenian en carta, la carta para mi gusto un poco reducida, al cabo del rato ( bastante) digo que tenemos un poco de prisa y el camarero responde que van todo lo rapido que pueden15 minutos despues de tomar la comanda me dicen que no tienen bacalao pero si quiero me haran una merluza a la llauna. El jefe de cocina que estaba al frente demostro no saber la diferencia entre merluza y pescadilla. Se√±ores tomen nota el restaurante solo tenia tres mesas con comensales, y la comida pedida no tenia tanta preparacion el bacalao de la esqueixada estaba congelado.PRECIOS DE CINCO ESTRELLAS COMIDA Y SERVICIO DE BAR DE LA ESQUINA DE CUALQUIER CASA SIN INTERES NINGUNO......NO SON MALOS SON PEOR QUE ESO.",1,2012,05,25

30,Gutes Hotel,"Allerdings keine echten f√ºnf Sterne wert. Die Zimmer wirken in Details etwas verwohnt, als h√§tten sie die besten Zeiten hinter sich. Wir haben uns aber noch wohl gef√ºhlt und hatten eine Junior Suite in der 24. Etage, sie bot eine sehr sch√∂ne Sicht √ºber Barcelona. Der Service war professionell.
Das Hotel liegt nicht im Zentrum. Mit dem Motorroller haben wir ca. 15min ins Zentrum gebraucht, falls wir uns nicht verfahren haben.

30,"Stylisches Hotel, freundlicher Service","Das Hesperia Tower ist ein sehr modernes Hotel mit stylischer Inneneinrichtung. Der Empfang und jede Auskunft an der Reception waren sehr freundlich. 

Wir haben kein Fr√ºhst√ºck dazugebucht. In einer B√§ckerei um die Ecke kann man sehr gut und preiswert fr√ºhst√ºcken. Das Caf√© 365 hat wie der Name schon sagt 365 Tage ge√∂ffnet. Der Kaffee con Leche und die piccola Croissons schmecken sehr gut! Einmal haben wir im Hotel gefr√ºhst√ºckt. Die Auswahl ist riesig, es gibt auch warmes Fr√ºhst√ºck wie R√ºhrei, W√ºrstchen und Speck. Nur finde ich den Preis von 15.- Euro f√ºr ein Fr√ºhst√ºck zu hoch.

Gegen einen Aufpreis darf man das SPA genutzen. Dort wird neben einem gro√üen Pool und Sauna auch Massage angeboten. Es ist eine Voranmeldung an der Reception n√∂tig.

Leider liegt das Hotel etwas au√üerhalb von Barcelona im Wohngebiet Bellvitge. Ein Restaurant zu finden wird etwas schwierig.",5,2012,04,15
30,Una bella esperienza,"Sebbene la nostra permanenza sia stata breve abbiamo trovato l'hotel hesperia tower confortevole e dotato di un personale attento e molto disponibile.
La camera standard, quella in cui ho alloggiato, √® originale, moderna e molto raffinata.
il giudizio, si sa, √® molto personale e soggettivo ma , per quanto mi riguarda, credo che questo hotel sia assolutamente un'ottima scelta! 
le uniche note negative riguardano la lontananza dal centro (pi√π o meno 20-25 min) e i prezzi della ristorazione (conviene infatti consumarli nel centro della citt√†)! concludendo, dunque, √® da provare vi rimarr√† nel cuore!",4,2012,04,11

Wer ohne Fr√ºhst√ºck gebucht hat besucht am besten das 3 Minuten entvernt gelegene Caffee Backstube 365 hier kann man sehr preiswert super Speisen.

- el agua se sale de la manpara de la ducha, y se encharca todo el ba√±o
- Algun manillar de puertas suelto

de resto todo genial, repetiria sin duda, pero me encantaria ver si vuelvo esos fallos areglados dado que fue una situacion algo patetica el estar en albornoz y poniendo toallas en el suelo.",4,2012,03,02

30,Super Hotel!!!!,"Super Hotel! Das war ein ganz tolles und angnehemes wochenende in Barcelona und wir verbrachten die vier N√§chte dort in diesem tollen Hesperia Hotel - am Rande der Innenstadt von Barcelona!

30,Tutto bello in apparenza...ma nel dettaglio?,"Ho troscorso una notte in questo hotel per questioni di lavoro.
La struttura √® davvero imponente frutto del lavoro di una archistar Richard Rogers. Hall e reception di grande impatto. Ascensori avveniristici. POi le stanze...belle con vista ovviemente dall'alto. Ma la manutenzione si capisce che non √® il punto di forza: appendo il cappotto e cade l'asta dell'appendiabiti, provo ad accendere la TV e non funziona...diciamo che i dettagli non sono proprio da 5 stelle.

Wir waren durch einen gesch√§ftlichen Termin f√ºr 6 √úbernachtungen dort und k√∂nnen zum Hotel generell sagen ""SEHR GUT !!!"".

30,"Muy buen hotel, y con buena comunicacion","Me gustaria compartir con todos la experiencia que tuve en este hotel y que me resulto del todo satisfactoria.

En primer lugar decir que consegui una muy buena oferta, cosa que se agradece en estos tiempos y que recomiendo a los gerentes a que sigan haciendo, de noche a precio muy bueno y ademas tenia desayuno y tambien mini bar gratis.  Gracias a esto disfrute de tres dias de relax en el hotel que ademas tiene servicio de recogida en el  aeropuerto y tambien de traslado al centro de barcelona.

la habitacion es muy muy comoda con una cama espaciosa y un cuarto de ba√±o impecable y muy limpio siempre, ademas cuenta con una gran cristalera que te permite tener unas vistas super amplias.

El desayuno muy bueno y de gran calidad con materia prima de primera y desde aqui quiero felicitar a la direccion del hotel por llevarlo de la manera que lo llevan.

Por ultimo una recomendacion, que es que al estar alejado del centro es dificil a ciertas horas comprar algo alrededor, pero si que de dia tienes al lado peque√±os supermercados, y tambien en cuanto a comunicacion tienes justo al lado el metro en la estacion del hospital de beltvige y que por la noche el autobus te deja justo al lado,

muchas gracias",5,2011,11,15

30,Buena ubicaci√≥n y mejor precio,"Lo peor es que estuvimos poco tiempo, el hotel est√° perfectamente ubicado, ya que si vas en coche, basta tomar la misma Gran V√≠a para llegar al centro en 15 minutos, sino una parada de metro est√° al lado del hotel. Muy buena relaci√≥n calidad precio, la habitaci√≥n amplia, bien equipada, muy buenas vistas, el desayuno muy completo, tranquilo y comodo. Desde mi punto de vista, para disfrutar de Barcelona, no hace falta pagar un dineral pudiendo disfrutar de un hotel de categor√≠a a 15 minutos del centro.",4,2011,10,02
30,El personal no est√° a la altura,"El hotel se halla un poco lejos del centro de Barcelona. A pesar de ello, las instalaciones compensan este inconveniente. 
La arquitectura, decoraci√≥n y las vistas desde las habitaciones son espectaculares. Sin embargo al personal le falta profesionalidad. Hecho que se puede apreciar en los detalles; el personal parece demasiado ocupado como para dedicarnos tiempo. Ejemplos: en el restaurante-buffet se termin√≥ uno de los platos, cuando solicitamos si quedaba m√°s, fueron a comprobarlo, pero sin embargo nadie volvi√≥ con la respuesta para informarnos.  Otro detalle fue, que el personal a menudo no se aproximaba a nosotros para hablarnos, sino que se dirig√≠a a nosotros mientras continuaban andando o bien nos hablaban a unos metros de distancia intentando ahorrar tiempo en la atenci√≥n. 
Por otro lado, la higiene de las habitaciones es correcta, as√≠ como los servicios disponibles. Tambi√©n es de agradecer la inmediatez y amabilidad en la atenci√≥n de recepci√≥n. No se crean colas de espera.
En nuestro caso, la relaci√≥n calidad-precio fue muy positiva pues aprovechamos una oferta que nos sal√≠a a 70‚Ç¨ la noche la habitaci√≥n Executive doble.",3,2011,09,29
30,"Un vero 5 stelle, talvolta a prezzo di un 3 stelle....!!","Che dire di pi√π delle dettagliatissime recensioni gi√† presenti?
Solo dare un'altra testimonianza del fatto che si tratta di un VERO 5 stelle: camere impeccabili e da sogno, bagni di pi√π, pulizia perfetta, vista mozzafiato, spazi comuni e servizi veramente al top.
Un dettaglio per me importantissimo: la qualit√† del sonno e della privacy! Sembra di essere in un'altra realt√† una volta che avete chiuso la porta della camera dietro di voi: non si sente pi√π nulla, da non credere!
Unico neo √® la distanza dal centro ma come avrete gi√† letto vi sono varie possibilit√† anche economiche e comunque ricordiamo che i taxi in Spagna non sono proibitivi come in Italia e se siete in 2-3 risultano persino economici.
Avrei un suggerimento per trovare offerte allettanti da un punto di vista economico: spesso prenotando sullo stesso sito dell'hotel si possono trovare offerte incredibili tutto compreso (anche il minibar!!) a prezzi di 3 stelle bisogna tenerlo d'occhio e tenere d'occhio il calendario con i prezzi.",5,2011,09,27

La habitaci√≥n era grande y muy c√≥moda.El desayuno excelente. El Spa muy recomendable para cuando llegas de una jornada de trabajo o una visita a la ciudad.El personal del hotel muy amable y cuando el servicio de microbus no puede acercarte al centro, la  boca de metros de la linea1 a menos de 200m de l hotel, te deja en menos de 20 minutos en la Plaza de Catalu√±a. Nosotros, si podemos tomar la tarifa de amigo, repetir√≠amos.",4,2011,09,14
30,Casi perfecto,"Excelente hotel ubicado en L`Hospitalet y no en Barcelona como erroneamente se puede deducir de la direcci√≥n que consta en la mayor√≠a de las p√°ginas de viajes. El final de la linea 1 de metro esta a dos minutos del hotel y llegas al centro de Barcelona en 20-25 minutos con f√°ciles conexiones a cualquier otro punto de la ciudad (Sagrada Familia, Barceloneta etc.)  Las habitaciones enormes con ba√±o separado impresionante y muy completo. La ducha con jacuzzi es una aut√©ntica gozada. La cama de 2 metros superc√≥moda, aire acondicionado perfecto, pantalla de plasma. En definitiva una gozada de habitac√≥n. El desayuno buffet mas que correcto, abundante y variado. Si he de poner alguna pega fue a la entrada, ya que nos debi√≥ tocar la tonta de la pel√≠cula que tardo mas de 20 minutos en encontrar la reserva. La relaci√≥n calidad-precio es excelente.

30,Lejos pero lindo.,"Muy lindo hotel, lejos del centro de barca pero muy comodo para llegar en metro, 
muy atentos los de recepci√≥n",4,2011,08,22
30,Buena experiencia pese a las adversidades,"Ya conoc√≠a este hotel de alojamientos anteriores. Nunca, en las 3 o 4 ocasiones en las que estuve tuve ning√∫n problema. En esta ocasi√≥n, 1er fin de semana de agosto del 2011, nos alojamos 2 personas. Al llegar nos informaron que el hotel habia estado completo y el check in deberia hacerse con un poco de demora. Para evitar ese incidente nos ofrecieron el spa gratuito toda la estancia, una suite en el piso 24 por 50 euros m√°s al dia y late check out (5pm) el ultimo dia. La estancia nos sali√≥ por 100 euros/dia. Un precio m√°s que acceptable por un hotel de 5 estrellas en agosto. Un diez para la politica de precios del hotel y para el staff de la recepci√≥n por este hecho. 
El hotel en s√≠, es sumamente original y moderno. Su sistema futurista de ascensores, su limpieza, su iluminaci√≥n cambiante, lo convierten en un hotel distinto sin llegar a ser pretencioso. No es un hotel para los amantes del turismo rural y de la naturaleza. Es un hotel que est√° muy alejado de todo lo interesante para el turista, pero se encuentra entre todas las vias principales de barcelona... asi que para evitar incomodidades es MUY aconsejable tener un coche de alquiler. El restaurante EVO es algo para visitar pero mejor no pasar de ah√≠. Un cena en el EVO implica, horarios extra√±os y calendario inexplicable (cierra todo el verano). Sistema de aire acondicionado insuficiente y sobretodo, muy caro. El restaurante de la segunda planta, el bouquet, es mucho m√°s aconsejable y m√°s asequible, aunque en barcelona hay centenares de propuestas m√°s atractivas. En definitiva, un hotel muy aconsejable. Incomodo en la ubicaci√≥n y los desplazamientos para los que no tengan coche. Limpio, moderno, futurista, y bien atendido por su staff. Sus restaurantes no llegan al nivel que prometen. De todos modos repetir√©.",4,2011,08,06
30,Geniales Design Hotel! Gerne wieder!,"Die Zimmer waren ausreichend gro√ü mit hervorragenden Betten. Sie sind sehr modern eingerichtet, mit Flachbildfernsehen, kostenlosem Safe, Klimaanlage, Badem√§nteln, zwei Waschbecken, F√∂n, separater Toilette und Minibar. Achtung: Die Minibar ist so voll gestopft, dass man unweigerlich etwas herausnehmen muss, wenn man eigene Dinge k√ºhlen m√∂chte. Sobald man aber etwas im K√ºhlschrank verr√ºckt oder herausnimmt, wird dies automatisch an der Rezeption aufs Zimmer gecharged. Ist aber kein Problem. Man sagt bei Abreise unten Bescheid, unterschreibt, dass man nichts aus der Minibar hatte und alles ist in Ordnung. Wir haben im 20. Stock gewohnt. Stra√üen- und/oder Flugl√§rm war so gut wie gar nicht zu h√∂ren. Auch ansonsten waren keine internen Ger√§usche st√∂rend. Die Zimmer verf√ºgen √ºber bodentiefe Fenster, so dass man einen ungest√∂rten Panoramablick genie√üen kann. Die Zimmer wurden t√§glich gereinigt. Alles war sehr sauber, au√üer unserem Spiegeltischchen, das wurde erst am dritten Tag gereinigt.
Wir haben das Hotel trotz der Randlage gebucht, da es mit den 5 Sternen mehr oder weniger das gleiche kostete wie z.B 3-Sterne-Unterk√ºnfte, die n√§her zum Zentrum lag. Die U-Bahn-Verbindungen sind wirklich hervorragend. Man muss allerh√∂chstens 5 Minuten auf die n√§chste Bahn warten. Die beste Wahl f√ºr die U-Bahn-Benutzung ist die Fahrkarte ""T-10"" (6,90 Euro). Auf ihr sind 10 Fahrten, die man unabh√§ngig von der Anzahl der Personen und der Zeit benutzen kann. Solange man ""unter Tage"" bleibt, kann man beliebig von einer Linie in die andere umsteigen und kommt so schnell zum Ziel.",5,2011,07,09
30,Gro√üartig!!!,"Der Aufenthalt im Hesperia Tower in Barcelona kann von uns definitiv als ""Ausgezeichnet"" bewertet werden, da wir bisher selten ein so sch√∂nes Hotel hatten. Es ist Design pur!!!
Das erste Mal, da√ü wir mehr Zeit im Hotel verbrachten als unterwegs waren. Besonders zu erw√§hnen ist das Sterne Restaurant im obersten Stockwerk - genial! Sehr gutes Essen plus ""gro√üartige Aussicht.
einziger Nachteil: Etwas au√üerhalb von der Stadtmitte (nordwestlich davon). Daf√ºr gibt es aber kostenlosen shuttle zum Flughafen (auf Anfrage!)",5,2011,06,28
30,Ich bin sehr zufrieden obwohl Lage nicht zentral ist,"Viele Berichten beklagen sich √ºber die Lage vom Hotel. Es stimmt, dass es nicht zental liegt, aber dabei kriegt man 5-Sterne-Qualit√§t und der Preis ist nicht furchtbar. 
Lage ist auch eigentlich nicht so schlecht - ca. 15 Minuten vom Flughafen. Gratis Shuttlebus gibt es auch, obwohl es nicht so oft f√§hrt. (Tip: vor Ankunft Email an der Hotel schicken - so bekommt man komplette Info √ºber die Airport-Shuttle, wie oft es geht und wovon, etc!) Metro Station liegt genau neben an - ""Hospital de Bellvitge,"" Linie L1, der direkt nach ""Catalunya"" (das heisst Zentrum) f√§hrt, in ca. 20 Minuten.
Der Hotel ist sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet, Lobby sehr modern und schick. Zimmer war sehr sch√∂n - bestimmt 5-Sterne Niveau. Besonders der Badezimmer hat mir gefallen mit luxui√∂ser Dusche, Spiegeln, etc. Es ist Teil von ""Novotel"" aber Hesperia sieht total anders aus. 
Spa/ Pool gibt es aber Achtung - es kostet extra. Wir haben es deshalb nicht benutzt. Fr√ºhst√ºck ist auch nicht inkludiert und ist l√§cherlich teuer, wie die Restaurants generell. Dass wussten wir aber im voraus. Wenn man Pl√§ne hat, auch im Hotel zu essen, soll man wissen, dass es teuer sein wird... Wir ging stattdessen zum Supermarkt (nicht weit entfernt) und kauften uns etwas Brot u.a. zum Essen ein. 
Fazit - 5-Sterne Hotel mit Zimmerpreise die sehr m√§√üig sind. Aber alles andere hat schon 5-Sterne-Preise...",4,2011,06,11
30,Nicht f√ºr Leute die Barcelona kennenlernen m√∂chten,"25 Minuten mit der Metro von der Altstadt entfernt. Im Umkreis kein Cafe, Lokal o.√§. um an einen g√ºnstigen Kaffee zu kommen ( im Hotel 4 Euro) oder abends ein Glas Wein zu trinken. Fr√ºhst√ºck mit Rabatt kostet 18 Euro. Die Zimmer sind klimatisiert, modern, sauber und mit einer grandiosen Aussicht jedenfalls von den oberen Stockwerken aus. Fenster sind nicht zu √∂ffnen. Der Aufzug ebenso wie die Lichtschalter im Zimmer erfordern technisches Verst√§ndnis. Die vielen Spiegel im Nassbereich st√∂ren. Das Personal war  zuvorkommend und freundlich. 
Das Hotel ist reine Geschmacksache aber die Entfernung zur Innenstadt ist ein gro√ües Manko und somit nicht zu empfehlen. Man kann nicht kurzfristig  ins Hotel und  Badeklamotten holen weil man sich entschieden hat doch noch ans Meer zu gehen bzw  2 Stunden Siesta halten weil man vom vielen Laufen m√ºde ist. Die Metro f√§hrt wochentags bis Mitternacht, somit ist ein ausgedehnter Kneipenbummel auch nicht drin ausser man leistet sich ein Taxi. Die Schlafqualit√§t ist aufgrund der Klimaanlage nur mit befriedigend bewertet. Das Preis- Leistungsverh√§ltnis ist in Ordnung wenn man auf Schnick-schnack wert legt.",1,2011,06,02
30,"modernes 5* Hotel, g√ºnstig zum Airport","Ich wurde in einem Standard-Doppelzimmer in einem der oberen Stockwerke des Hesperia Towers untergebracht. Das gesamte Hotel und vor allem das Zimmer ist komplett durchgestylt, sehr modern, in warmen dunklen Farben gehalten. Zimmer und Badbereich ist sehr gro√üzuegig gehalten. 

Die Einrichtung ist in einem sehr guten Zustand und mit allem notwendigen, bis hin zu iPhone/iPod Dock etc. ausgestattet. 

Die Lage zum Flughafen ist guenstig, es verkehrt auch ein kostenloser Shuttlebus. Zur Innenstadt ist es durchaus ein Stueck, jedoch z. B. mit der nahegelegenen Metro kein Problem. 

Einzig der Zimmerservice enttaeuschte - das Essen kam nur noch lauwarm im Zimmer an und konnte auch geschmacklich nicht ueberzeugen.",5,2011,05,14

El desayuno espectacular: super variado y de calidad.
Muy buena relacion calidad precio. Recomendable",4,2011,04,25
30,Mejor Imposible,"Una noche he estado alojado en este hotel y la verdad es k todo ha sido perfecto. Las vistas son impresionantes. Desde nuestra habitaci√≥n en el piso 11 la perspectiva era muy bonita. Se veia casi toda BCN.
La habitaci√≥n es muy espaciosa, con un sofa, con vistas a la tv, y escritorio. El ba√±o es increible. Lleno de espejos, dos picas. Lo malo es que no hay ba√±era, se trata de un plato de ducha con hidromasaje, eso si, enorme.
El desayuno, servido en la 4 planta tb goza de muy buenas vistas, era muy variado y de buena calidad (embutidos ibericos, quesos frescos....).
Adem√°s dispone de WIFI gratuito en todo el hotel con una clave que te proporcionan en la recepci√≥n.
La atenci√≥n del personal ha sido excelente, no ha habido ningun problema.
La situaci√≥n del hotel es lo peor del mismo. Se encuentra situado en las afueras de BCN y si no tienes coche solo te keda el metro que tarda 30minutos hasta el centro.
Repetir√© sin dudarlo.",5,2011,04,17
30,Excelente hotel,"Nos alojamos un fin de semana en el Hesperia y la verdad es que cumpli√≥ todas las expectativas. La habitaci√≥n espaciosa, cama muy c√≥moda y con toda clase de detalles de un hotel de esta categor√≠a. La √∫nica pega, por ponerle alguna, es que el lavabo no ten√≠a ba√±era pero s√≠ ducha de hidromasaje. Acceso wifi gratis en la habitaci√≥n.
Estuvimos en la planta diecis√©is con buenas vistas aunque no las mejores de Barcelona. Despertarte y tener las nubes tan cerca es toda una sensaci√≥n. Ten√≠amos acceso al Tower Club en el que pod√≠as tomar algo a cualquier hora y sin nadie que moleste. 
La ubicaci√≥n del hotel no es de las mejores, tiene parada de metro a dos minutos y en treinta minutos est√°s en el centro de Barcelona. 
El desayuno estuvo bien pero tampoco nada del otro mundo. 
L√°stima que el Spa no estuviera en el mismo hotel, tienes que ir al club Metropolitan y aunque est√© conectado con el hotel no deja de ser un paseo. Si estuviera en el mismo hotel ser√≠a perfecto.

30,Che emozione guardare Barcellona da cosi' in alto!!,"Siamo stati in questo hotel grazie ad una offerta di un sito ad un prezzo molto basso per un 5*. Viaggiamo con un bambino piccolo, la preparazione della camera e' stata fatta con cura con culletta per il bambino inclusa nel prezzo e piccolo accappatoio. Il servizio della reception e' stato impeccabile, gentilissimi e pronti ad accogliere ogni richiesta. Un po' meno accurato il servizio in camera, abbiamo atteso tantissimo per avere del bagnoschiuma aggiuntivo (piu' di 1 ora!), la camera era attrezzata con accessori da bagno per una sola persona tutt'e 4 le notti che abbiamo dormito li'. Le camere hanno una parete vetro che da sulla citta' e sono arredate in stile moderno minimalista, emozionante soprattutto di sera. La struttura e' molto bella, in linea con le stelle dell'hotel. E' possibile scegliere il proprio cuscino da un menu' cuscini disponibile nella camera. 
La pecca maggiore dell'hotel a mio parere non e' tanto la distanza dalla citta', dato che proprio di fronte all'hotel c'e' la metropolitana che porta direttamente al centro e che un servizio gratuito di minibus dell'hotel porta a piazza Catalunya; quanto la mancanza di ristoranti vicini all'hotel. Si e' costretti a mangiare al ristorante al piano terra carissimo, come seconda scelta c'e' il servizio in camera (unica opzione cara ma abbordabile) e quasi impossibile mangiare al ristorante al 29esimo piano perche' sempre prenotato e piuttosto inaccessibile come prezzi.
Da questo punto di vista alla reception non ti aiutano granche' perche' cercano palesemente di farti mangiare nei loro ristoranti. Abbiamo scoperto tramite un programma sull'Iphone un localino nei dintorni a buon prezzo, strapieno di spagnoli dove si mangia cibo tipico. Se cercate e avete voglia di fare 4 passi a piedi, le opzioni non troppo distanti ci sono...",4,2010,11,09

30,Impresionante!!!,"Una ""junior suite"" fu√© el regalo para mi pareja por su cumplea√±os y nos encant√≥ a los dos! El hotel, el personal, la habitaci√≥n, los detalles, la comida... todo exelente! Repetiremos seguro!",5,2010,09,09
30,Bezahlbare Luxus√ºbernachtung in einem wundersch√∂nen Turm,"Ich war Anfang Juli mit meiner Freundin in Barcelona. Wir suchten zuerst g√ºnstige Hotels, aber nach langer Suche entschieden wir uns ein Hotel zu nehmen, welches einigermassen gelegen ist UND zugleich etwas mehr Luxus im Hotel selbst bietet.

Und sch√∂n war das Hotel bzw. die Suite wirklich.
Die Suite war ger√§umig, sauber und auch relativ schnell k√ºhl. Die Aussicht war pr√§chtig (im 16. Stock); Beim ersten Eintritt f√ºhlt man sich wirklich wohl, da der WC-/Duschbereich schon sehr edel aussieht.
Das Zimmer war nicht gr√∂sser als das Zimmer, welches wir im Hesperia Fira Suites (gleich nebenan) gebucht haben, aber daf√ºr nochmals sch√∂ner.

Die Bedienung war sehr sehr freundlich und zugleich auch kompetent. Wir m√ºssen auch sagen, dass wir eher unproblematische G√§ste ohne allzu hohen Anspr√ºche sind.
Wir haben zum Beispiel das Gep√§ck selber getragen haben, haben also auf den Gep√§ckservice verzichtet. Vorhanden w√§re dieser aber auf jeden Fall.

Die Lage ist nicht wirklich zentral aber etwa 200m entfernt vom Hotel ist die Endstation der Metro. Dort kann man bequem in die Metro-Bahn einsteigen und Richtung Zentrum fahren. Das Gute daran ist, dass alle St√ºhle noch frei sind ;-)
Ausserdem hat es noch Taxis in der N√§he.
F√ºr die An- und R√ºckreise (vom / zum Flughafen) empfehlen wir dringend den Bus (Metrokarten sowohl f√ºr Metro-Bahn als auch f√ºr Metro-Busse g√ºltig)!
Die Mindestpauschale bei Taxis liegt bei 20 oder 25‚Ç¨ (bin mir nicht mehr sicher)!!! Und das ist definitiv zu viel und nur bei Versp√§tungen zu dringenden Terminen empfehlenswert (da Taxis sehr schnell und flexibel).

Ich empfehle die Buchung - falls √ºberhaupt m√∂glich - zu speziellen Konditionen zu buchen. Damit meine ich die Buchung - direkt √ºber die Seite - die zwar nicht mehr annulliert werden kann, aber das Fr√ºhst√ºck inklusive ist.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist n√§mlich erstklassig - und ist im Hesperia Tower. Bis um 12.00 haben sie die T√ºren offen. Alle G√§ste, die noch drin sind d√ºrfen weiter speisen. Auch die Bedienung ist dort erstklassig.
Wir konnten f√ºr die Buchung f√ºr dieses Hotel nicht zu speziellen Konditionen (wie oben erw√§hnt) haben, aber das liegt vielleicht daran, dass wir spontan und vor Ort diese eine √úbernachtung gebucht haben.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck h√§tte uns dann 19‚Ç¨ pro Person gekostet, was uns aber doch etwas zu viel war. Schade, aber nicht tragisch, da wir dort bereits in den vorherigen Tagen gespiesen haben.
Das Personal am Empfang war wie erw√§hnt sehr freundlich und auch kompetent. Wir erhielten jedes Mal eine zufriedenstellende Antwort.
Auch gab es einen Shuttlebus, welcher die G√§ste zum Zentrum oder sonstwo transportieren.

Die 5 Sterne sind also absolut gerechtfertigt. Und hier kann man von Luxus UND aber auch gutes Preisleistungsverh√§ltnis sprechen.

Zu erw√§hnen sei, dass das nat√ºrlich nur unsere pers√∂nliche Meinung ist.
NICHT genutzt haben wir:
Gep√§cktrageservice
Spa vom Hesperia Tower (w√ºrden wir das n√§chste Mal wohl besuchen)
Sportaktivit√§ten vom Hesperia Tower
Nachtessen im Restaurant vom Hesperia Tower (EXTREM TEUER!!!!!)",5,2010,08,02
30,Una perla,"Premetto due cose:
1 Non ero mai stato in un hotel 5*
2 L'ho comprato ""al buio"" su lastminute pagandolo circa 60‚Ç¨ a notte

L'hotel √® splendido gi√† all'esterno, merito di Rogers, famoso architetto che ha progettato la struttura, spicca in un quartiere immerso nel verde ma di stampo palesemente popolare e lontanissimo dal centro, √® vero che la metro √® a 100 metri dall'albergo, (nonstante il quartiere non si trova nessun tipo di problema a fare questo piccolo tratto di notte) ma ci vogliono ugualmente 30minuti di viaggio per raggiungere il centro, l'albergo per compensare questo offre una navetta gratuita che porta in piazza catalunya.
La hall enorme mostra immediatamente il design che caratterizza tutto l'albergo e alla reception troviamo dei ragazzi gentili e disponibili, la loro unica pecca √® un inglese abbastanza scarso ma comunque capibile.
Gli ascensori sono parecchio particolari, bisogna preselezionare tramite touchscreen all'esterno il piano, successivamente lo schermo indica quale dei 4 ascensori prendere, una volta capito il meccanismo diventa tutto molto automatico (i velocissimi ascensori esterni con vista sulla citt√† compensano questi momenti di panico).
La stanza √® davvero fenomenale, si entra in una sorta di ""anticamera"" piena di specchi, dietro 3 di essi si trovano la cabina armadio, il water e l'idrodoccia ENORME, una porta conduce alla stanza vera e propria dove un'intera parete √® formata da vetro e permette una suggestiva visuale sulla citt√†, il letto √® enorme e comodissimo; completamente gratuiti vi sono: wi-fi, accappatoi, pantofole, tv al plasma, cassaforte e una serie di oggettini poco utili ma che rendono decisamente l'idea del confort!

Da segnalare il centro benessere a 12euro al giorno (palestra, piscina, idromassaggio, letto ad idromassaggio, sauna, bagno turco, docce di varie temperatura)

Unica pecca i vari ristoranti e bar hanno prezzi davvero, davvero, davvero proibitivi, si parla di 5 euro per un caff√® e 15-20 per un panino.",5,2010,07,27
30,Excelente,"Buen Servicio, excelente trato al cliente, satisfecho..",5,2010,07,25
30,Gran Hotel!,"Aunque ya hab√≠a o√≠do hablar del Hesperia Tower en varias ocasiones, hasta este mes no he tenido la oportunidad de visitarlo y no me ha defraudado en absoluto. Desde la calidez de su personal hasta el cuidado de todos los detalles (los productos de ba√±o son espectaculares), la estancia ha sido espectacular.
Volver√©!",5,2010,07,22
30,No deberia tener la categoria de 5 estrellas!! Muy caro para lo que es,"Os contar√© mi experiencia en el Esperia de Barcelona situado en Gran V√≠a.
Mi pareja decidi√≥ para celebrar nuestro aniversario escoger este hotel con un pack romantico valorado en 299 euros con cena en el restaurante EVO.

Para empezar decir que si vas con maletas nadie se ofrece a ayudarte. 

El parrking carisimo y se paga aparte.

Cuando nos trajeron las fresas con cava nos entraron en la habitaci√≥n sin llamar a la puerta! Al darse cuenta la chica cerr√≥ y entonces llam√≥... no se dar√≠a cuenta!!pero en general los trabajadores no los vi que se mataran demasiado. Y luego para rematar al entrar en la habitaci√≥n tir√≥ las copas al suelo y todo lleno de cristales.

En cuanto a la habitaci√≥n: Muy normal y las vistas no matan, la silla que habia estaba super manchada.... y en el ba√±o no hay bidet.

El Spa al no forma parte del hotel y cada vez que quieras ir tienes que pasar por recepcion a buscar una moneda, y tienes que ir completamente vestido pq sino te llaman la atenci√≥n.
La piscina es cerrrada y te tienes que poner gorrito y el solarium es una zona de suelo sin un trozo de hierba y un par de duchas medio rotas. Sin contar que si quieres tomar el sol te has de esperar pq hay pocas y siempre est√° lleno.

La targeta del hotel nos fall√≥ en un d√≠a dos veces.

En el restaurante EVO ciertos platos muy salados .
En el restaurante cuando acabamos de cenar nos quisimos lebantar para ver las vistas y nos vino una camarera detr√°s corriendo que pagaramos las bebidas!! que prisa no?? no teniamos pensado escaparnos.

Y para finalizar mi pareja cogi√≥ del minibar 2 botellas de agua 3.5 euros cada una y nos cobraron 20 euros. Y no les servia que les llamaramos por telefono nos hacian personarnos en el hotel para reclamar. Total 330 euros una noche de hotel con cena y ""spa"".

No hicieron la habitaci√≥n en toda la ma√±ana.

Lo unico que valorar√≠a como muy bueno el desayuno pues habia para todos los gustos, desde churros con chocolate, pastas, panes, caf√©s, infusiones, huevos... etc.

Si querreis un pack romantico aconsejo el Rey Juan Carlos (muchismo mas lujoso y excelente trato) o el Finca Prats en Lleida tambien es una pasada.",2,2010,07,21
30,Einfach Tower...,"Der Hesperia-Tower ist wunderbar vom Flughafen erreichbar und was jeder Tower so an sich hat, von weitem gut sichtbar. Die Lobby ist liebevoll - trotz puristischer Ausstattung - gro√üz√ºgig und hat echt Wohlf√ºhlcharakter. Mit dem Aufzug gehts dann mit Blick auf Barca in die Zimmer. Unser Zimmer war modern mit wunderbarem Blick auf diese tolle Stadt. Wenige Gehminuten entfernt ist eine Metro und damit sind Sie wunderbar mit der Stadt verbunden. Das Hotel macht ein wunderbares Fr√ºhst√ºck und wer vom Blick auf die Stadt nicht genug bekommt, setzt sich beim Fr√ºhst√ºck auch an die Fensterfront. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen - auch das Bad ist toll...",5,2010,07,19
30,Luxus pur 5*,"Geniales Hotel, ein bischen ausserhalb aber sonst super toll. 
Essen unbezahlbar aber macht nichts, Supermarkt 100m und kleine Bars in der N√§he.
Mit der Metro vom Hotel ist man in 20min in der City Placa de Catalunya!",5,2010,07,18
30,Sehr zufrieden,"Die Lage des Hotels ist der Grund warum man dieses Hotel f√ºr ein sehr guten Preis bekommt. Wenn man Gl√ºck hat bezahlt man sogar weniger als f√ºr ein Hostel in der Stadt.
Mit der Metro oder dem Hotel eigenen Shuttle ist man in 20 Minuten im Zentrum.
Das Personal ist sehr aufmerksam, die Zimmer sind sehr modern eingerichtet, das Badezimmer ist toll, leider ist die Klimaanlage laut.

Hinter dem Hotel gibt es eine kleine ""Einkaufsmeile"", mit einigen Cafes und kleinen Superm√§rkten.
Sonst ist das Hesperia Tower von Betonkl√∂tzen aus den 70igern umgeben.",5,2010,06,09
30,"Hotel Top, Lage Flop","Das Hesperia Tower mit dem preisgekr√∂nten Restaurant auf dem Dach verdient seine Sterne - nur √ºber die Lage sollte sich jeder, der hier √ºbernachtet, im Klaren sein. F√ºr Gesch√§ftsreisende, die zur Messe auf dem neuen Messegel√§nde wollen, ist es sicher kein Problem, aber wer als Tourist zu den Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten m√∂chte, der muss wissen, dass man mit der U-Bahn durchaus eine halbe Stunde bis zum Placa Catalunya unterwegs ist. 

Das Hotel beeindruckt durch sch√∂ne Zimmer, freundlichen Service, kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten am Abend (die Schokolade war lecker..) und ansprechendes Design. 

Leider wurde das Hotel an die Stra√üe zum Flughafen gebaut, gegen√ºber ein gro√ües Krankenhaus, dahinter einige Wohnbl√∂cke, die zu den Baus√ºnden der 70er Jahre geh√∂ren. Ja, Taxis warten vor dem Hotel, so dass man der Gegend schnell entkommen kann, und auch die U-Bahn-Haltestelle ist nicht weit. Nichts destotrotz sollte man sich vorher einmal ansehen, ob die Lage f√ºr einen das richtige ist. 

Ansonsten: ein sch√∂nes Hotel.",5,2010,06,02
30,Exquisitez,"Magn√≠fico Hotel, Excelente servicio y atenci√≥n, restaurante fuera de lo com√∫n, entre los mas famosos del mundo, habitaciones fant√°sticas, detalle cuidado.",5,2010,04,27
30,Es una autentica pasada,"el hotel es una verdadera pasada,las habitaciones,el ba√±o y el vestidor un lujo.La comida impresionante.Est√° situado en una zona cercana al aeropuerto y con una boca de metro al lado.Super-bien comunicado.Lo peor que se nos olvid√≥ poner el cartel de no molestar y a las 19:00horas una se√±orita de cofia llam√≥ al timbre para ver s√≠ deseabamos  que nos hiciera la habitaci√≥n.Adios siesta!",5,2010,02,16
30,Tolle Aussicht und gute Verkehrsanbindung,"Das Hotel liegt ausserhalb des Zentrums, auf dem Weg zum Flughafen und direkt an einer der Verkehrsmagistralen. Das merkt man im Hotel selbst jedoch nicht, es ist ruhig. Auch die U-Bahn ist in unmittelbarer N√§he. Das Hotel selbst ist modern und designorientiert eingerichtet. es verf√ºgt √ºber tolle Wellness-Angebote und ein Panoramarestaurant im ""Dach-UFO"".

Der Ausblick aus meinem Zimmer war traumhaft. Ich hatte ein Zimmer in einem der obersten Stockwerke und in Richtung Hafen / Innenstadt und konnte nachdem ich im morgens, vom Bett aus elektirsch die Vorh√§nge ge√∂ffnet hatte, einen tollen Blick auf die Stadt und die Olympia-Anlage mit dem Telefonica-Masten genie√üen.

Tolles Hotel gerne wieder auch f√ºr eine St√§dtetour.",5,2010,01,06
30,Inmejorable!! el mejor capricho que nos hemos dado en a√±os!!,"Reservamos una de las habitaciones duplex por el fin de semana para una ocasion especial. Cuando llegamos al hotel fueron muy rapidos y cordiales, la habitacion y sus vistas quitan el hippo!!!! el jacuzzi junto a la ventana de noche es algo genial. Incluso cenamos en la habitacion, no queriamos salir de ella, era genial. 
Todo es muy comodo y la cantidad de servicios que entran el el precio hace que este no sea disparatado. La comida y servicios geniales, y el Tower club es una idea brillante y que tambien hizo que la experiencia fuera tan buena como para que nos decidieramos en el primer dia a volver pronto. Con lo horrendo que es el aspecto del hotel por fuera, el shock que te llevas de lo bonito que es dentro ya es una experiencia en si. Aun pagando casi 450‚Ç¨ por un fin de semana entre todo, no tengo nada malo que se√±alar de ese hotel estupendo",5,2009,12,28
30,5 stelle che bello!,"Per la prima volta ho provato l'ebrezza del 5 stelle, sfruttando una promozione a 90 euro a notte, beh non vedevo l'ora di tornare in camera la notte. Camere ECCEZZIONALI nuove doccia idromassaggio pay tv plasma, letto comodissimo, pulizia ecezzionale, dotazione camera eccellente. Unico inconveniente colazione troppo cara come il bar della reception, un caff√© 5 euro! ma una volta imparata la lezione....
Consigliatissimo a tutti, da provare il ristorante all'ultimo piano, Carissimo, ma una volta nella vita si pou' fare.",5,2009,10,26
30,personale pessimo!!! sperate di non avere bisogno di loro...,"La bellezza dell'hotel √® innegabile per√≤:
- Check-in 55 min!!! La ragazza che ci ha seguito ha sbagliato la registrazione (3 volte...), ci ha chiesto se volevamo la colazione ad un prezzo e poi ne ha fatturato un altro, ecc, ecc.  
- Avevamo fatto la prenotazione e il PAGAMENTO tramite l'agenzia ma al nostro arrivo risultava che la stanza fosse da pagare. Chiediamo di contattare l'agenzia e come risposta ci chiedono una carta di credito a garanzia.
- Il giorno seguente ci dicono che l'agenzia, da me preventivamente avvisata, ha rifiutato il pagamente, peccato che avessi gi√† letto in copia la mail dove lo confermavano!!!
- Il personale era scortese e incompetente.
- Le chiavi magnetiche, necessarie anche per gli ascensori, si smagnetizzavano OGNI giorno!!!
- Alla reception si limitavano a parlare spagnolo, salvo poi scoprire che parlavano perfettamente italiano!!!
- L'hotel √® di fronte la metro...peccato che ci siano almeno 35 min. di treno.

In conclusione un hotel che √® effettivamente molto bello √® rovinato dal personale del ricevimento che √® assolutamente inadeguato ad un 5 stelle.",1,2009,09,04
30,Para volver y disfrutar,"Excelente Hotel. Atenci√≥n esmerada y adecuada a su calificaci√≥n. Lobby fastuoso. Habitaciones adecuadas a la categor√≠a del Hotel. Bares, restaurant y servicios de habitaci√≥n muy buenos. Su Spa Metropolitan fant√°stico. Su √∫nica contra es que esta lejos de todo. Sin embargo tiene el Metro en la puerta. En 30 minutos puede ir donde quiera. Para recomendar",5,2009,07,09
30,"Excelente, toque a detalle!!","Nuestra experiencia ha sido genial, no podria pedir mas, han pensado en todos los detalles y m√°s.. tuvimos un suite en una planta alta, el desayuno abundante y muy variado, servicio de tranfer al aeropuerto, accesso a piscina, sauna, choros de agua, solarium, un hotel muy completo",5,2009,06,16

30,Dos palabras fue una experiencia imprensionante e inolvidable,"Elegi este hotel para darle una sorpresa a mi marido (salir de la rutina) y la verdad que estuvo estupendo, desde que entramos por las puertas del holl hasta la salida, la atenci√≥n fue amable y cordial, es super bonito, nos alojamos en la plata 24 imprensionantes vistas, y las habitaci√≥n por dios que chula, que pedazo de cama, super comoda, es como si el colchon me abrazara, el ba√±o super bonito, la ba√±era de hidromasaje, todo los accesorios y todos los peque√±os detalles, el desayuno muy bueno, habia varidad para todo los gustos, la verdad que fue lo deseado, asi que animo al Tower, seguro que volvere a repetir",5,2009,05,04
30,Decepcion,"Nos hemos alojado 4 veces en este hotel, que hasta el momento era nuestro hotel preferido, la primera vez fue hace casi dos a√±os, en mayo de 2007, ya hice un critica en su momento y antiguamente este hotel era la PERFECCION, esta semana santa fui nuevamente con mi mujer y fue decepcion tras deception, el trato ya no es el que era, el buffet tampoco, huevos,salchicas y poco mas... han quitado las cafeteras nesspreso, los productos de calidad que hacian que se diferenciase este buffet de otros hoteles.
Los amenities ya no son Bulgari, ahora anuncian que son Etro, pero realmente son Hesperia, los mismos que tienes si vas a uno de sus 3 estrellas, ademas te encontraras nada mas con un gel y un champu, nada mas, ni kleenex, ni cepillo, ni cepillos de dientes... nada de nada, vamos que en un Formule 1 tienen mas detalles.
El hotel continua teniendo su encanto, la construccion es muy singular y las habitaciones estan muy bien, pero un 5 estrellas tiene que tener mas de lo que ahora mismo dan.
Ademas tanto el restaurante Evo como el bar Bouquet han estado cerrados toda la semanasanta.... cuando se hace la reserva deberian avisar que estaran cortos de personal y que no daran algunos de sus servicios.

Un saludo",2,2009,04,13
30,Irrepetible!!!,"Increible experiencia en un hotel de 5 estrellas que vale el precio que pagas!!! Empezando por el personal, servicial en todos los aspectos, pasando por las habitaciones, llenos de detalles y servicios, hasta el lujo de todo el hotel con los restaurantes, el lobby y incluso los ascensores con vistas!!!
Recomiendo a todo el mundo que vaya al Hesperia Tower, cualquier excusa es buena para alojarte en este hotel de lujo sin fin.",5,2009,01,22
30,strepitoso,"Per un viaggio a Barcellona, abbiamo deciso di privilegiare il comfort alla centralit√† della posizione. Sapevamo infatti che questo bell'hotel era lontano dal centro di BCN, ma ci saremmo spostati in taxi ed in metro, la cui fermata era vicinissima all'hotel. E' stata una delle pochissime volte in cui sono rimasto stupito per la bellezza della stanza, oltretutto concepita in maniera originale: si entra direttamente nella zona guardaroba/lavabo, molto ben rifinita, con due zone isolate per la doccia (a filo con il pavimento) ed il wc. la decorazione era di gran classe, il letto comodo e bello, come belli erano i tendaggi, i mobili, ecc. . In definitiva √® valsa la pena di fare un po' di avanti e indietro, per alloggiare in una stanza cos√¨ bella e conortevole. Bella e originale la Hall, con i suoi lampadari-scultura, i divani bassi e le luci viola, bello anche il ristorante del grande chef Sant√¨ Santamaria, situato in quella specie di disco volante posto sulla sommit√† dell'hotel, ma che non abbiamo potuto provare, in quanto tutto riservato per i 15 giorni successivi.",4,2008,11,26
30,fantastico hotel,He estado tres veces en este hotel y mi consideracion es que es genial siempre me he alojado dos veces en una suite y una vez en el club pero todas son buenisimas sobre todo el servicio en el club un trato como se merece y correponde a su categoria sin dudar espara mi uno de los mejores en barcelona lo unico malo es que no esta en una zona buena en vistas si este hotel estuviera en el centro seria el mejor pero en servicios y diseno no lo gana ninguno lo recomiendo,5,2008,04,20
30,Un 10 - Vale lo que pagas,"Fuimos mi marido y yo a celebrar nuestro d√©cimo aniversario de novios en la D√∫plex Suite con cena y ba√±o rom√°ntico.

2-	EL trato EXCEPCIONAL... y lo pongo en may√∫sculas porque se lo merece.
3-	La comida buena.
4-	Muy Limpio.
5-	La decoraci√≥n: un 10! 
6-	Las vistas lo √∫nico malo. No se puede decir que est√© situado en la mejor zona de Barcelona.

Precio Calidad : 10

Vale lo que pagas.  A ese precio no se puede encontrar nada",5,2008,04,10
30,Hesperia Tower - Critica,"Staff: El chaval de Montevideo, el chaval que esta por las ma√±anas en el Restaurante Azumet sirviendo los desayunos (el joven), y una chica de pelo colorado oscuro que, por lo menos en mi caso, me trajo dos veces que orden√© comida al room service, son las √∫nicas personas del staff que valen la pena, el resto un desastre, poco amables.

Habitacion: Estuve en una Junior Suite en la planta 24, la habitaci√≥n es muy lujosa, cuenta con dos TVs LCD de 42"", una sala de estar, cama king size, el ba√±o cuenta con ba√±era y ducha de hidromasajes, un vestidor, productos de ba√±o Bulgari, aire acondicionado. Grandes vistas, con ventanas que van desde el suelo al techo, cortinas el√©ctricas que se abre y cierran solas. Minibar (con precios car√≠simos + 7% IVA).

Restaurantes: El restaurante EVO estaba cerrado, seg√∫n el hotel por cuestiones ajenas, vaya uno a saber qu√© cuestiones ajenas se refieren. El Bar Bouquet no lo us√©. El Restaurante Azumet esta bi√©n. El Bar del Lobby muy malo.

La habitaci√≥n Junior Suite cuenta con acceso al Tower Club, pero cuando yo estuve alojado, estaba cerrado por reformas. Se supone que el hotel deb√≠a reemplaza el servicio del Tower Club, y aunque estaba dispuesto de esa manera, el servicio era p√©simo. Quitando el desayuno, el resto era una mentira. Se supone que el Tower Club ofrece de 7 a 11 desayuno buffet, de 11 a 16 un surtido de Bocadillos, embutidos y ensaladas, de 16 a 19 una selecci√≥n de pasteler√≠a fina, y de 19 a 23 tapas. Quitando lo del desayuno buffet, el resto es mentira, solo ofrecen bebidas, para comer durante el d√≠a, absolutamente nada. Con esto uno se ve obligado a pagar los estratosf√©ricos precios del hotel para poder comer algo, un desastre.

Instalaciones: Lo mejor de las instalaciones del hotel son los ascensores que utilizan una tecnolog√≠a muy novedosa, por lo menos para mi. Al principio puede resultar un poco complicado pero una vez que le explican a uno como funciona es f√°cil y hasta c√≥modo.

Durante mi estad√≠a en el hotel hubo un d√≠a que llovi√≥ much√≠simo en Barcelona. El staff del hotel se pas√≥ todo el d√≠a secando goteras, en el lobby hab√≠a much√≠simas, en la planta donde estaba mi habitaci√≥n, en el hall hab√≠as charcos de agua provocados por las goteras, al d√≠a siguiente ah√≠ segu√≠an.

El d√≠a que llovi√≥ se cort√≥ la luz en todo el hotel, inentendible como un hotel de 5 estrellas, con tarifas de 210 euros la noche (es lo que pagu√© yo por noche), no tiene un generador para estos casos. Dej√≥ de funcionar la conexi√≥n wifi, el Digital+ se cort√≥ durante todo el d√≠a, la luz en las habitaciones tard√≥ m√°s de 4 horas en reestablecerse, un desastre, evidentemente no estan preparados como un hotel de esta categor√≠a deber√≠a estarlo.

Metropolitan Club & Spa: El gimnasio y spa esta pegado al hotel. Los hu√©spedes del hotel pueden acceder por un pasillo interno que tiene acceso directo al gimnasio. En mi caso el uso del gimnasio y spa estaba inclu√≠do en el precio que pagu√© durante mi estad√≠a. El gimnasio no lo us√©, solo us√© el spa. 

El spa es verdaderamente un lujo, con jacuzzi, diferentes tipos de duchas (biot√©rmica, de cubo, etc). El jacuzzi cuenta con diferentes chorros de agua, y unas tumbonas que se encuentran dentro del jacuzzi, con hidromasaje. El vestuario del Metropolitan es tambi√©n muy lujoso, con TV, secador de pelo, casilleros con puertas de madera. 

Conclusi√≥n final: No pienso volver nunca m√°s al hotel Hesperia Tower. Lo que deber√≠a haber sido un fin de semana de relax, termin√≥ siendo un fin de semana donde no me fue posible disfrutar por la inoperancia del staff (exceptuando por supuesto a las personas que mencion√© m√°s arriba), la no existencia de un plan en caso de corte de energ√≠a general, etc, etc, etc.
No lo recomiendo, hay mejores hoteles en Barcelona, m√°s baratos, mucho m√°s c√≥modos, y que ofrecen todo lo que publicitan en su p√°gina de internet, vamos, que no le mienten a la gente.
