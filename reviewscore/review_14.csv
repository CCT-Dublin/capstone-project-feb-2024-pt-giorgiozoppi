14,Great location and helpful staff at this beautiful gem hotel in the Gothic Quarters!!!!,"Beautiful Hotel in the historical Gothic Quarters.  Walking distance to the Barcelona Cathedral and all the best restaurants and shops.   
Thomas was such a huge help.  His radiant smile and energy were so welcoming, he helped with our transportation and gave us great suggestions on everything from where to eat, to what to do.",5,2024,10,12
14,"Gem in the Gothic Quarter with an intimate , friendly and low key charm.","Warmest welcome !!!!  From the moment Thomas (the charming and energetic door man and welcome chief) collected us and our baggage, to the easy and personal check in , to the personal touches   to the fantastic location in the historic Gothic Quarter , everything about Hotel Neri makes me want to return!
Strongly recommended….
Don’t miss the exquisite roof-top terrace",5,2024,10,11
14,Fabulous Service and Stay in the Gotham Quarter,"I came into my solo Barcelona trip with high expectations, and somehow Hotel Neri exceeded it. Some highlights:

– Attentive service. Everyone from the concierge to the bellhop to the restaurant staff went above and beyond to make me feel at home.
– The details. Oh, the details! Welcome truffles in my hotel room, more chocolates each night with turn-down service, the most comfortable robes ever.
– Every foot of the hotel was spotlessly clean.
– The location was perfect – right in the middle of the Gotham Quarter, but still very quiet.
– And the breakfasts. WOW. We got a full pastry basket, fruit tray, in addition to two entrees of my choice (I went with a tasty omelette + smoked salmon plate).

Thank you Neri and your amazing staff for giving me a Barcelona trip to remember. I will be back!",5,2024,10,09
14,Great choice for Barcelona!,"We had a fabulous time at Neri.  It's many great features include:  super location, incredible design details, very comfortable bed & pillows, terrific breakfast & snacks.  Best of all is the staff headed by Ivan who are friendly, helpful, efficient, knowledgeable, & caring.

14,Fabulous hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in. The Staff is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, including Thomas the porter. The rooftop pool is beautiful and always empty. The room was so quiet even tho it's right in the heart of the Gothic quarter, with floor to ceiling windows. I really can't say enough wonderful things about our stay here and will definitely be back. Thank you Casa Neri!",5,2024,10,08
14,A wonderful first visit to Barcelona,"It was my first trip to Barcelona, and Hotel Neri was a great place to spend it.  The staff was professional and attentive.  Thomas was particularly friendly, informative and helpful.  ",5,2024,10,08
14,Historic hotel in gothic quarter,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location. Located in the gothic quarter in a historic square. Perfect for walking. Hotel is beautiful and has old charm. Staff are so friendly and welcoming. Ivan made us feel at home and helped accommodate us when our flight was delayed. Julian went out of his way to help us get transportation during busy times. The rooftop was lovely. We didn’t get a chance to eat at the restaurant as our trip was cut short with flight delays but my parents loved the chef tasting menu. Would definitely want to come back and stay longer!,5,2024,10,02
14,Wonderful Stay - Highly Recommend,"We had a wonderful experience staying at Hotel Neri! It was a quiet and restful place to be in the midst of the Gothic Quarter. The staff, like Tomas and Jean-Louis, were very helpful and friendly. The small touches - soft robes, welcome gift, quality linens - really stood out for the thought that went into choosing them. Plus the food was amazing! Highly recommend the breakfast.",5,2024,09,20
14,Look no further - Hotel Neri is incredible,"I truly cannot put into words how highly I recommend this hotel. We had the most incredible stay. The location, the design, the comfort, the staff, the food — not a single detail was left untouched. 

Our concierge/doorman/host Thomas went above and beyond to make sure every moment of our stay went smoothly. He provided world class service with recommendations, bookings, and more. He personally walked us over to get a taxi multiple times. 

This hotel is incredible and in the heart of Barcelona’s old city, the gothic quarter. If you’re considering this hotel, book it.",5,2024,09,19
14,Beautiful 5 star Boutique Hotel,"We have only left this morning but already miss this wonderful boutique 
hotel set in the most intriguing part of Barcelona     The edge of the Jewish quarter.    

From our greeting at reception to departure we have had the best service and assistance.   A special
Shout out to Thomas for his efficient help confirming our pick up transfer to the airport !!

We had an appt for the week.   So much room and so timely to have a washing machine and a wonderful sunny rooftop pool with space to relax from the sightseeing and business. Plenty of wonderful eating places/tapas bars all within easy walking and so much history to absorb

We had a beautiful
Meal at the restaurant and sat in the courtyard for drinks two different evenings. 

We loved Barcelona  and if we come back we would stay here again without a doubt.",5,2024,09,12
14,Great experience! I would stay here again!,"From the moment you make your reservation,  the hotel is tuned to you and your comfort.  Their driver service picked us up at the Barcelona Airport and whisked us to the hotel. Located in a renovated castle, each room was comfortable and clean. It was small, but comparable to the area; we were greeted by the "" bellhop"" ( I'm sure he does much more) and we checked in. Make sure you have European converters,  if you are from the US. No TV to speak of. But there was free wifi and a speaker, so i connected and listen to my music and a couple of pod casts. Every detail was above and beyond. The bed and linens were awesome. The staff made sure we had everything we wanted. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,09,08
14,Stay Here.,"We loved our stay at Hotel Neri. The location is perfect, the building is beautiful, the beds are oh so comfortable, and the food (dinner and breakfast) were delish! Also, the service was personal and so attentive. Thank you Thomas for making us feel like such special guests!!",5,2024,09,03
14,Amazing Experience- Must stay here!,"Our stay at Hotel Neri was perfection. The hotel is gorgeous, the beds are divine, and the staff goes above and beyond. Tomas was wonderful and so helpful with anything we needed- restaurant recommendations, city suggestions, and even scheduled a free virtual doctor’s appointment and took us to the pharmacy to pick up the medication that was prescribed. Many taxis are reluctant to drive to the front of the hotel because of the narrow streets in the Gothic quarter, but rest assured, if you call ahead, Tomas and staff will be waiting wherever you arrive to get your bags for a seamless check-in experience. This is our second stay at Hotel Neri and we will return for any of our future trips to Barcelona. 12/10 recommend!!!",5,2024,08,29
14,Wonderful hotel in the perfect location!,"A true gem in Barcelona. My family stayed at this hotel during our stay following a cruise - everything from the staff that greeted us, to the housekeeping staff, all were incredible. The hotel is in the perfect location in the Gothic quarter, it is impeccably designed and had every comfort & amenity we needed. The staff went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable and had what we needed. The concierge was also fantastic. I really appreciated the organic amenities in the bathroom of our annex apartment - lovely! The breakfast was also a top highlight-each morning we were so full! Dinner was also delicious. We loved Barcelona and will definitely return to this hotel. Thank you to everyone at Hotel Neri for a wonderful stay.",5,2024,08,27
14,"Lovely accommodation, average restaurant","This is a fabulous little hotel in a very special location.  There are not many places which get you this close to the cathedral and many other attractions and still gives you a quiet space.  The staff we encountered were all very helpful and informative.  We thoroughly enjoyed our spacious room.  The only reason they did not get 5 rating is we were very disappointed with the restaurant, which we tried for dinner and breakfast.  Both were disappointing.  Not getting what we ordered at dinner.  We both gave a different egg order for breakfast and received our meal exactly the same and not what either of us had requested.  
We would absolutely recommend staying here, just find elsewhere for your meals.",4,2024,08,22
14,A perfect hotel in the heart of the gothic section of Barcelona,"Perfection in the heart of the Gothic section of Barcelona.   Our family of six ( 4 kids ages 13, 16, 18 and 21) stayed at Hotel Neri for our one day in Barcelona.  First- the location was amazing - tucked on a quiet alley in the heart of the historic gothic district.  The Cathedral of Barcelona, the Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, street opera at night and many other amazing historic landmarks were mere steps from our hotel … a perfect base from which to explore.  From the moment we arrived - the hospitality was warm, friendly and genuine - from all staff.  Mauro greeted us, checked us in and made sure all our needs were addressed throughout our stay.  Thomas was entertaining and great help getting us settled and accompanied us out into town to be sure we found the perfect lunch spot.   Our waiter for dinner whose name we did not learn was warm friendly and very helpful with spot on recommendations.  We had an amazing dinner in their chic restaurant and our usually unadventurous eaters were convinced to try many new food items and everything was delicious and devoured.   We also enjoyed a perfect breakfast with delicious pastries, the sweetest fruit, and perfectly prepared omelets and French toast.   And finally the rooms - they were heavenly… the most comfortable beds ever, tasteful lighting and spectacular bathrooms with lovely skin and hair products.  We would not hesitate to recommend Hotel Neri to our most picky traveler friends.",5,2024,08,16
14,Great location and service,"Great hotel! Location is hard to beat for this high quality of a hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful also helped to give us a good insider view of the city. The bellman, Thomas is very helpful, friendly, and energetic. What a great face of the hotel!!",5,2024,08,11
14,Lovely hotel with nice staff  in a great location,"Lovely hotel overall. The rooms are exceptionally clean, beds are very comfortable. The extra bed we had for our child was great, a real mattress, not a cot. Our room had a tub/shower combo that was not easy to get into, it was steep, slippery, and there is nothing to hold onto, so if that is a concern for anyone, do ask for a room with a walk-in shower. For those sensitive to odors, there is a very strong flowery/perfume smell in the lobby. Some may enjoy it. I did not. The rooftop is a very. nice place to sit. The pool is cute, but not a pool for swimming. It's more for dipping your feet. The staff was great, very nice and helpful, and it was clear they wanted to offer a nice experience to guests. The one disappointment was the breakfast, which was nothing like other amazing breakfast experiences we've had in Spain, with beautiful buffets and wonderful cheeses and meats, yogurts, pastries, etc. This hotel offers a bit of fruit, a small not so tasty bread basket, and our eggs arrived cold. 
The location is excellent.",4,2024,08,10
14,Romantic hidden gem in the gothic district,"This was my first trip to Barcelona and I was looking for a cool place to stay with a friend and the Neri hotel was superb!!! Located in the heart of the gothic district, the hotel is within walking distance to Boqueria market /la rambla/, place catalanya, gaudi buildings, and main shopping streets. The Gothic area is filled with cool tapa places and bars which made it quite convenient. The hotel is located on a pedestrian street so be prepared to walk 5-10minutes with your luggage from the nearest taxi drop off point.

The interior design and service were top notch /Miranda at the front desk took very good care of us/- with all the amenities of a luxury boutique hotel. The only downside- the rooms are a bit small but were very clean and the bed very comfortable. 

The rooftop pool is very small / not for swimming/ but provided a nice little oasis on a hot day. Had to use the phone by the elevator to call someone for cocktails as the call button by the sundeck didn’t work. Cocktails were good. 

The hotel does not have a gym but the front desk provided us passes to a nearby gym /15min walk/  & spa facility which was quite decent and had an indoor pool /there was a 20euro fee to enter/.  They do require swimming caps to use the pool so be prepared.

Overall, would def recommend this hotel to friends looking for a luxury boutique hotel experience in a historic part of Barcelona!",5,2024,08,05
14,Neri hotel,Great hotel in the middle of the Gothic area. Great location and super staff. Met at the door by Miranda and Tomas as well as a gentleman from the bar with water. All were wonderful and helpful. Tomas even rolled our bags several blocks to load into the limo! Would stay there again in a heartbeat! All of the staff were great!,5,2024,07,31
14,"Incredible Hotel, Staff and Location","Visiting Hotel Neri as a family of five on holiday we were immediately struck by the friendly and warm welcome. We were also struck by the incredibly lobby, which centres the history of this amazing hotel. The experience was faultless from the spotlessly maintained rooms to the incredible restaurant… and at every stage it was obvious personal attention was being given to every guest. It’s stunning central location also made the city visit more memorable. A special shout out to Marina, Thomas and Ivan – you made our family holiday even more special in gorgeous Barcelona. My wife and I look forward to returning as soon as possible.",5,2024,07,27
14,"5 star stay in a quiet, centrally located and charming area in Barcelona","A Stunning hotel with beautiful, clean and comfortable rooms in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. The restaurant and lounge serves delicious food and has a great assortment of wines and cocktails. The entire staff was very friendly and warmly welcomed us into their city. In particular, the maid staff kept our room pleasant and clean. We especially want to thank the bell-man Thomas (the “superstar”) for greeting us every day with a smile and helping us carry our luggage to the cab a few blocks away. We would love to return and stay again soon.",5,2024,07,21
14,"Great hotel, central location.","Great hotel in a nice area of Barcelona. I stayed at the hotel for one night, while traveling on and found it to be a great place to spend a night. The guy who works at the front door was awesome and very helpful. The restaurant was ok, I wish we had gone elsewhere for dinner, but overall very happy with the hotel.",5,2024,07,16
14,"Lovely, historic hotel","I stayed at Hotel Neri with my family. We had a wonderful experience. The hotel staff (Julien, Thomas, and Miranda) we all so accommodating and friendly. The hotel is a perfect combination of old world class and modern amenities. I wouldn't change a thing about my stay. ",5,2024,07,08
14,Would love to come back!,"What a beautiful hotel and lovely staff. We felt welcomed and looked after in this great location. Our calm refuge from the heat and crowds. We were in an apartment across from the hotel which gave us room to ‘spread out’ but still enjoy the ambience of this hotel. Everything was thoughtfully done, from breakfast trays to fluffy dressing gowns and lovely natural bathroom products",5,2024,07,05
14,An oasis of calm with superb service,"We were made to feel welcome the minute we stepped through the door. Staff were superb. Thomas, Christos and Julianna were amazing. They called us taxis, booked out restaurants and made sure that we were happy at every possible opportunity. The building was beautiful and perfectly located in the medieval city an oasis amongst the little alleyways and cobbled streets. 
After a days exploring what better to return to a tranquil roof top garden for a cool dip and a beer. Our room was perfect- quiet, comfy bed and lovely bathroom. Our terrace was lovely to sit out on with a book and the sounds of birds and occasional church bells. Breakfast was excellent quality and choice.",5,2024,07,04
14,LOVED IT - the perfect spot for our family!,"Super charming, beautiful small hotel adjacent to large plazas in heart of Barcelona. Rooms were very well designed, functional, clean and aesthetically pleasing. The BEST part was the amazing service we received - special call out to Pedro, Carlos and Thomas who were all friendly, fun and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Not just at the hotel, but in Barcelona. Cool feature is our room had an private outdoor tub/shower on the balcony!",5,2024,07,01
14,A wonderful sojourn in the Gothic Quarter,"The hotel was interesting and well presented. The front desk staff were all very friendly, accommodating and attended to every need. Despite a couple of glitches, everything was attended to and resolved efficiently and with goodwill. Despite the fact that cars needed to stop 100 m from the hotel, the front staff came and assisted with moving  our luggage without any fuss. Being in the middle of the gothic quarter meant we were central to most tourist attractions. The hotel arranged a fabulous guide to take us to the Gaudi buildings, which was amazing, and well worth the cost. The highlight was the smiling face and repartee of the doorman Tomas, who exudes joy with every interaction with the guests, often in multiple languages. We’d happily return next time we travel to Barcelona.",5,2024,06,29
14,Perfect for a couple’s trip!,"This boutique hotel has some really awesome decore and a cool vibe all around which was really nice for a couples trip, but it was the people who made our stay so special! Thomas was the best bellhop I’ve ever interacted with and all of the staff we talked to were so friendly and helpful! The espresso martinis that we had at the bar were some of the best I’ve ever had too. All around, would come back and recommend in a heartbeat!",5,2024,06,29
14,Hidden gem at the heart of Gothic Quarter,"We had a wonderful stay at the Neri hotel. Many thanks to all the staff who made us feel so welcome and were always on hand to assist with recommendations and bookings. The hotel is perfectly situated at the heart of the Gothic Quarter making it easy to walk everywhere.  Although very central, it was very quiet at night. The room was spotlessly clean and the hotel itself has a wonderful boutique feel to it with a charming rooftop terrace.",5,2024,06,28
14,"Great stay, highly recommend","My mom and I stayed here for four nights, and it was a fantastic experience. Everyone was extremely kind and helpful, making it a wonderful trip. Our room was very comfortable, with a window overlooking the picturesque square outside of the hotel. The hotel itself is charming, beautiful, and in a great location within the Gothic Quarter. Highly recommend Hotel Neri to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Barcelona! Oh, and the restaurant is great too!",5,2024,06,26
14,Unbelievable hotel!,"Really, really love this hotel.  Great location, nice physical plant, but most of all, an amazing staff.  Can't imagine how our stay could have been better.  ",5,2024,06,25
14,Beautiful hotel in perfect location,"The hotel was in the perfect location, in the heart of the gothic quarter and a block from the cathedral. The hotel was historic but the rooms were very modern and comfortable. The staff were fantastic and the restaurant was very good (we ate breakfast there each day and dinner one night). Booking through Amex came with great perks. Highly recommended.",5,2024,06,19
14,Great place to stay,Wonderful hotel great breakfast. Thomas is amazing so positive and friendly. The rooms were comfortable and clean and the hotel products were a treat. The candles are a really lovely addition to the lobby and add to the overall ambiance. Highly recommend,5,2024,06,15
14,Perfect stay in the heart of Barcelona,"Beautiful hotel in the perfect location for visiting everything in the city. Full of character and on a beautiful little square. Restaurant here and their sister hotel is first rate. The staff are lovely, helpful and attentive. Especially on reception and Thomas who will help with anything.",5,2024,06,10
14,What a luxury stay!,"This is the second time we stayed at this hotel. The first time was 8 years ago. The location is perfect to us. Some people complain about that they cannot get to the hotel by car. Yes, you have to wlak to/from the hotel enterence for a few minutes to the near by location to be picked up or dropped off since this area is restricted to general traffic. That is one of the charm points of this hotel. The classic room is smaller side but very functionable. The window is soundproof and do not hear very much noise from outside. Bathroom amenities, such as soap, shampoo, and hair conditioner are nice. However, the seramic containers are very hard to use in the shower booth. I wish the hotel comes up with better container design. 
We have breakfast and dinner at the hotel restaurant, ""a"" a few times. There was a waiter very kind to us to accommodate our request. 
There was a very up-beat bell staff at the hotel. I believe his name was Thomas. He greeted us with a big smile in the morning and afternoon whenever he saw us. 
Our reservation was made with regular rack rate and it included ""invited to La Hora del aperitivo."" It means that you have a chance to enjoy one drink with a few tapas at the hotel restaurant. You need to reserve it in advance so the restanrant is ready for you. I believe ""invited to La Hora del aperitivo"" is set for either 12pm - 1pm or 6pm - 7pm. We loved this hotel. I do not mind going back again if I have another chance.",5,2024,06,05
14,The very BEST!!!!!,Hotel Neri was fantastic!!! Great and fun location right in the heart of things.  Thomas was energetic and an excellent concierge!!!  He helped in any way he could.  The day we needed to get to the cruise terminal they hooked us up with a driver even when there was a taxi strike going on!!!  The included breakfast was fantastic and a great way to start our day…. Sometimes it was my favorite meal of our day.  Treat yourself and stay here… it was totally worth it!!!!,5,2024,05,28
14,Incredible!,"Absolutely incredible staff. Tomas, Mauro and Julian are informative, kind and professional. 
The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. 
The food is fresh and delicious. 
This hotel is in the Gothic district/center of Barcelona, so there is no shortage of historical sites and cafes!
It really doesn’t get much better.",5,2024,05,26
14,Our exceptional experience at Hotel Neri and Restaurant “a”,"Me and my girlfriend had a great experience in hotel Neri and an amazing dinner at  restaurant “a”. With the hotel located next to placa de sant Felix neri where you can also find the terrace of restaurant “a”, we had a very romantic evening with great food, excellent wines and cocktails.",5,2024,05,20
14,5 Star in the Heart of the Old City,"We really enjoyed this hotel carved out of a medieval home- lovely room, excellent service and great food.  The staff was very attentive and helpful.  The location was perfect - tucked away in the center of the old city just steps from the cathedral.  Hotel Neri was the perfect place for our introduction to Barcelona.",5,2024,05,17
14,Hotel Neri,"Our friends and I booked 2 rooms. We were supposedly upgraded. I got a room which was 1/3 smaller than our friends room. Our “deluxe” room had only a desk and 2 hard chairs. Our friends room was significantly larger with plenty of walking space, a large sofa and a desk and chair. We paid exactly the same amount. They admitted our friends room was larger but said that’s the way it was. 
Just beware of the differences in room sizes in the same room category. 
Thomas, the bell man, was extremely helpful with not only luggage but also directions and restaurants. Our stay was very good because of Thomas. 
The food in “a” restaurant was very good. The menu was interesting and delicious. Breakfast was also very good.",4,2024,05,17
14,"Warm, welcoming, Home away from home.","We have just come back from a fantastic stay at Hotel Neri in Barcelona. From the moment we greeted at the door, we were blown away by how welcome we were made. The Hotel itself is beautiful and steeped in history. We were given a lovely tour of the hotel before we were shown to our room, which  again was beautiful. This visit to Barcelona was for our 20th wedding anniversary and all I can say is we had a fantastic stay at Hotel Neri, all the staff were so kind and helpful, and we would definitely recommend staying here. The hotel is in a great location,, tucked away down an alley, so was nice and quiet, but still close to Everything. Breakfast was also good, a lovely platter of fresh fruit, different pastries, jams and orange juice , with a choice of two other options off the menu (delicious). Thank you so much to all the staff at Neri, I’m sorry I can’t remember all your names, but keep up the good work, you’re all amazing.",5,2024,05,16
14,Wonderful Hotel and Staff,"Neri Hotel is centrally situated in the Gothic are of Barcelona. The hotel is a tasteful blend of old and new design. Our room was spacious, clean and well appointed. 

However, the real highlight of this hotel is the staff. The ever cheerful, courteous staff offered touring suggestions, arranged transportation and tickets. This is the first time I’ve left a hotel knowing the names of so many staff members. A special thank you to Miranda, George, Thomas, Ivan and Mauro.",5,2024,05,16
14,Outstanding customer service and location!,"This boutique hotel is situated in the heart of the Gothic City making so much to see walkable and full of beauty, history and architecture. The staff- from the management to the restaurant servers to the front desk gave us the very best customer service and are  truly friendly people. Tomas was our daily welcome at-the-door person with fabulous and fun energy. The front desk personal are all fabulous…Mauro and George to name the ones who were on the job at the times we needed help the most. So wonderful!",5,2024,05,09
14,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE HOTEL NERI - BARCELONA,"We stayed at the Neri Hotel from April 10, 2024 to April 12, 2024, 3 nights!!  The service of the ENTIRE staff was nothing short of EXEMPLARY!!  These are the names of the staff members we requested to submit in this review;
Rooms Division Manager: Dario
Camarero: Pablo
Recepcionista: Miranda
Portero: Thomas
Recepcionista: Mauro
Segundo de recepcion: Ivan
Everyone of these representatives of NERI were so professional as well as personable to us during our stay in Barcelona, we wanted to make sure EVERYONE was made aware to stay at this wonderful location!!  The hotel is next door to the Barcelona Cathedral and is so centrally located in ""Old"" Barcelona, you just can't ask for a better experience!!  Special thanks to Dario for recommending the FANTASTIC Pasteleria - CAELUM which is so close to the hotel, you want to go there every day and we did!!  The Hot Chocolate as well as the pastries were absolutely delicious!!  The food at the hotel restaurant was also excellent and we enjoyed our stay IMMENSELY!!  We can't wait to return to Barcelona and by now we are sure you know where we plan on staying!! Gracias Hotel NERI por todo !!!!",5,2024,04,30
14,Exceptional stay Exceptional staff,"I stayed March 28th-April 5th 2024 with my family at Hotel Neri while visiting my son during his study abroad studies.  We found Hotel Neri to be a very welcoming, beautiful and helpful hotel. Every person is welcoming and tentative.  The helpfulness started while we were still state side.  We wanted to preplan a day excursion and some tours.  Miranda, originally from Brooklyn, was easy to communicate with and helped us navigate the suggested tour website.
    After arriving, Thomas was a stand out.  He was very personable and spent time learning our names and a little about each of us.  He actually walked us to a little Tapas place and hooked me up with a flat iron for my hair!
    Every staff member was friendly and took the time to greet us everyday coming and going.  We took their dinner recommendations and had 2 excellent meals; one for paella and Canete's for Tapas.
    We loved Hotel Neri's location in the Gothic Quarter which is within walking distance to many sites.
    We had 2 rooms.  One a junior suite and the other a deluxe.  The junior suite overlooked a small square with a church and school.  The windows kept the sounds out but I enjoyed opening the windows and hearing the children playing at recess. Our room was very comfortable and large.  
     My husband went down to restaurant everyday for breakfast but I order in.  I tried different items everyday and I didn't find it difficult to order.  My full breakfast came with fresh orange juice, fresh fruit, and a basket of assorted croissants and rolls.  They were served with the best preserves and tomato compote.  My only suggestion is the coffee could be hotter but I guess that's what you get for being to lazy to leave your room.
    At the end of our stay I left a bag of gifts for my son to pick up after our departure.  The staff kept it safe for him and he was able to pick it without any problems.
   Overall, I would highly recommend Hotel Neri.",5,2024,04,28
14,Beautiful hotel with warm service,"There are many wonderful things to write about Hotel Neri but the most notable was the service. I prepaid a suite for a much anticipated solo getaway but then made a huge mistake of selecting the wrong dates for my reservation. The upfront policy was clear that there was going to be ""no refunds"". The hotel team had full right to enforce that policy since it was completely my error but they were so generous to accommodate me on the correct dates. Moreover, when I was at the hotel, the service was warm, the staff knew my name and welcomed me like a guest in their own home. It has been a while since I have received this kind of service in the era of no-contact check-ins. 

I loved the old/new feel of the hotel. The building was itself a beautiful historic structure, but the juxtaposition of modern decor touches really made it special. The suite that I stayed in was spacious with tall ceilings with separate living room and bedroom.

I would most absolutely come back to this wonderful boutique hotel the next time I am in Barcelona. I would highly recommend it to others as well.",5,2024,04,24
14,An exceptional experience in an exceptional location.,"The hotel is located right in the Barcelona hub of activity. As soon as you step outside you are surrounded with the historical quarter, restaurants, bars and history. The room is beautifully designed and convenient and the bed is the most comfortable we have experienced in Europe. Whilst the hotel location and room were wonderful, it was the staff that made our stay such an exceptional experience with their helpfulness and loveliness. Special mention to Thomas and Miranda who were so very helpful and welcoming.",5,2024,04,17
14,"Lovely, old hotel with wonderful staff.","Tucked back in the Gothic (Gothic) neighborhood, Hotel Neri is a good experience of living in the old area of Barcelona.  The staff is exceptional: friendly, welcoming, accommodating. Be aware that there is no accessibility for a taxi or cab to drop you off at the front door, so if you have luggage, be sure to stay in touch with the front desk so they can send someone to assist you to get to the front door.",5,2024,04,16
14,Perfect city hotel,"Small hotel situated near Barcelona Cathedral (not Sagrada Família) in the Gothic quarter and a couple of blocks from Las Ramblas. The taxi initially dropped us in the cathedral square which wasn’t a problem. Taxis will come to the hotel through the pedestrianised area but it’s just as easy to hail one on Las Ramblas or the far side of the square. 
We had an apartment for 3 adults just down from the hotel which was well appointed with comfortable beds and a good shower. 
Breakfast was a platter of pastries, juice, bread, jams and fruit for each table. You could then order freshly 2 cooked dishes which were filling and delicious. 
The staff were friendly and helpful, getting us difficult to obtain reservations in a local tapas bar and helping with taxis and directions. They provided bottled water whenever we asked.",5,2024,04,15
14,The Pinnacle of Hospitality,"Every single thing about my stay was fantastic. Every person working at the hotel made a point to make a personal connection with me, ensure that I was taken care of, and arranged everything to perfection. Thomas in particular was fantastic!

The hotel itself is beautiful. It is hidden away on a walking street and feels like a peaceful oasis. The location is a dream for travelers who like to walk. You are in close proximity to restaurants and shops. 

The rooms are well appointed, clean, comfortable and fashionable. The roda toiletries are also a lovely touch.

I would absolutely stay again and recommend hotel Neri to my friends.",5,2024,04,12
14,A Perfect Stay in Barcelona at Hotel Neri,"Hotel Neri is conveniently located in the old Gothic quarter, within walking distance of the cathedral, La Ramblas, Picasso museum and many other sites. 
From the moment we arrived, the lovely staff made us feel welcome, offering us coffee while they checked us in after our overnight flight. 
Our classic room overlooked a small square on which there’s a historic church and an elementary school. In the early evenings, musicians can be heard playing below. 
The bed was very comfortable, the shower wonderful, the robe cozy and the amenities top-notch, including the most comfortable hotel slippers I’ve ever worn. I appreciated that everything is environmentally friendly. 
The wonderful staff helped accommodate all requests including bringing coffee to the room before room service began on a day when we had a very early tour and arranging for a taxi to the train station. 
We will certainly recommend Hotel Neri to friends and stay there again on return visits to Barcelona.",5,2024,04,06
14,Not worth the money!,"The hotel is listed as a Relais and Chateaux but unfortunately does not meet the standards in my opinion. 

The staff is friendly and helpful but on one occasion we felt intrusive  (when they took us to our room). We felt uncomfortable. 

Breakfast was a la carte but not that good. They do offer a good selection of items to choose from but it lacks quality. For example, my egg benedict was presented in a cold brioche with a tasteless sauce, the pastries were very greasy. We offered orange juice (not fresh) which tasted like vitamin C orange flour. 

By the way, you need a degree maybe a master's to order your breakfast. You have to choose two items from the right column and two from the left column. You can have an omelette with onions but you can't have an omelette with ham and cheese this counts as three items...I found it very confusing. I heard other guests had difficulties ordering as well. 

I ordered a coffee while I was having my breakfast and I needed to wait 20+ mins to have it as the waiter's priority was to clean the dirty tables first and then make my coffee...  The quality of the coffee was not that good (to my standards) 

The location is very good, right in the heart of Barcelona.",2,2024,03,21
14,A Yes From Me and the Family,"My family and I were really able to enjoy a nice Spring break at the Hotel Neri. 
Everyone was super friendly and we were able to accommodate ourselves nicely with everyone even though we didn't speak spanish. It was very well located, pretty close to the beach so that was a plus, and there were tons of nice restaurants around the area as well as the great restaurant inside of the hotel. The rooms were comfy and with the interior of the rooms being completely noise proof served as a huge help with majority of my family waking up easily to noise in the middle of the night. 

It was a very great trip and I hope to comeback with friends next time!",5,2024,03,18
14,Great location and helpful staff,"We stayed at Hotel Neri for 5 nights in one of their apartments across the road from the main hotel.  The apartment we stayed in has one bedroom, one bathroom, small living space with pull out sofa, a kitchenette, washer/dryer, small desk area and a dining table.  It worked well for our needs.

The hotel is situated in a great location as you can walk to so many places and it’s also close to the Metro. At certain times of the day  a taxi may not be able to drop you right at the hotel but it is a short walk from the drop off point.  Use Google maps to find your way to the hotel from there as it can be tricky to know which narrow street to walk down. 

The hotel staff at the front desk, front door and housekeeping were very friendly, professional and helpful.  They helped us find a guide for a private walking tour, recommended restaurants, loaned us an adapter, booked taxis for us, showed us how to use the washer/dryer and helped with a couple of small problems. 

The main floor of the hotel is nicely decorated and very relaxing. There is a small bar off of the restaurant which is a nice spot to take a break and have a drink.  There is also a rooftop deck area where you can get service by pushing a button and have a drink up there. 

We found a couple of the restaurant staff to be a little bit rude, like we were putting them out when we asked them a question or when we ordered a drink but that only bothered us for a moment.

I would recommend this hotel.",5,2024,03,18
14,THE place to stay in Barcelona!,"Fantastic atmosphere, beautiful interior, perfect location, and extremely friendly and helpful staff. Concierge Thomas made our stay top notch, treating us as royals, and was always helpful, even walking us to find a table at a nearby restaurant. A fun and helpful receptionist that even spoke norwegian and italian, gave great advice and information. We really enjoyed hanging out on the secluded and green rooftop. We will definitely be back next time we´re in Barcelona!",5,2024,03,09
14,A Designer’s Comfortable Oasis,"This hotel was the perfect place to stay after walking the hectic streets of Barcelona. The location is perfect for shopping and proximity to the random musician playing in the Gothic Quarter. If you are craving the beach, the beach is a reasonable walk from the hotel. I have nothing but great things to say about this gorgeous hotel with impeccable service at a luxury stay. The service was amazing and the hotel was immaculate.",5,2024,03,04
14,Great Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for 7 days in Feb. What a great experience this was from the hotel presentation to the first class ""staff""didn't want to leave.... we've stayed at our fear share of nice hotels but this one stood out and checked all the boxes. We will be back!",5,2024,02,20
14,Charming hotel in great location,We loved this hotel. The entrance is gorgeous with a huge set of wooden doors propped open and an equally beautiful set of metal framed glass doors set behind them. The lobby is attractive and welcoming and smells lovely. The charming doorman Thomas was very helpful. The room was attractive with a comfortable bed. We loved everything about it. It was a pleasure to step through the doors each time we returned from our explorations.,5,2024,02,10
14,Perfectly position in the Gothic Quarter,"Just home from a three night stay in a deluxe room in Hotel Neri. The stay was fantastic and the hotel is beautiful. The location is the best thing about it - within the Gothic Quarter, on beautiful quaint streets and close by gorgeous restaurants. Particular thanks to Mauro and Thomas - both very helpful and friendly without being overbearing. Breakfast was excellent and it was great to leave each morning feeling really set up for the day. The room was extremely comfortable and we slept fantastically. The rooftop area is cute and definitely would be worthwhile in the summer months. 

To give balance, this hotel obviously isn’t cheap. To us, the hotel is worth the money but you probably just need to consider whether you’ll be in it enough, when there is so much to do in Barcelona to justify the cost. For us, this was our second visit to the city so we knew we’d like the extra relaxation and very glad we did.",5,2024,02,05
14,You won’t find better,"One of the best stays I have had over the course of a long life.  Combine the beautiful location, its history and the best of class service, it’s hard to beat.  That service included taking over the tracking and receipt of a suitcase ITA had lost while we explored Barcelona as well as adjusting their pace to allow me to practice my Spanish.  Imagine Ritz Carlton service but with greater attention given the smaller size of the hotel.  We loved it!",5,2024,01,29
14,Loved it!,"We love Relaix & Chateaux properties, and Hotel Neri lives up to that standard.  For extra space, we chose an apartment across the street from the Hotel, occupied primarily by families.  It was lovely, with a very quiet pool and terrace on the roof.  Note, however, that food and drinks are only served at the Hotel's pool, not the apartment pool.  Concierge and front desk staff were top-notch.",5,2024,01,14
14,Nice small hotel in  a quiet street.,"The hotel is located in the Gothic Quarter, which is not without its problems of access by car.
The hotel is isolated and quiet in a small street.
The welcome is warm and friendly and you soon feel at home.
The Amex FHR benefits are well applied, but I didn't get anything extra as a loyal R&C customer. 
The room is very pretty, modern and very well maintained.
The food is delicious and the products served are of high quality.
Breakfast is decent, but there's no buffet.
The staff are very friendly and proactive.
It's a pity that the manager doesn't show up to meet his customers, as some FHR hotel managers do elsewhere.
I had a good stay at this hotel. 

",4,2024,01,07
14,Great hotel and Exceptional Help,The hotel is in a great area with amazing service. Would highly recommend it. What actually stole the show was Tomas. This man was exceptional. He greeted us and helped us in the utmost amazing way. Every hotel should have a person like him. Tomas is one in a million.,5,2024,01,04
14,A gem in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"What an amazingly charming boutique hotel in the center of the gothic district. It is gorgeous, with an ancient internal courtyard incorporated into the lobby that houses the staircase, and room access points. You really get to know the staff while staying here, and they are all top notch. I would particularly call out Mauro, who was an amazing concierge. All of his bar/restaurant recommendations were spot on, and he was able to call them, as an insider, and secure reservations. He was extremely personable and helpful and went out of his way to provide excellent service and guidance. Not to be outdone was Thomas, who manned the door. He knew everyone’s name and made you feel so incredibly welcome, as if this was your home. He is one of the friendliest individuals I have ever met and helped set this hotel apart, along with Mauro.

This was 5-star service with a staff who knew you by your first name and went above and beyond to make sure you had the best experience in Barcelona. The rooms were great, etc. but the best part of this hotel was the staff, location, and building. Staying at the Neri enhanced my Barcelona vacation and made it better than it would have been had I stayed elsewhere. Hats off and many thanks!",5,2024,01,01
14,Elegant but understated comfort for a family trip,First time in Barcelona and picked this hotel rather randomly without much research. And it was lovely! Quaint and quiet. Central and close to the subway. Breakfast was hearty and the French toast just delicious. Staff was friendly and helpful. Anything we requested was brought to us right away. They helped us get out bright and early with breakfast done so we could catch our train to the next destination. We had an apartment a few steps from the hotel which was nice when you’re with family. It has a kitchen with a washer and dryer which was a huge bonus! Loved the courtyard view from my room. So much to do in Barcelona and being here allowed us to also experience the local streets and overall vibe of the city because we were close to everything. I really hope I can come back here.,5,2023,12,29
14,Christmas at Hotel Neri,"Everybody has been extremely helpful from arranging tours and directions to restaurant recommendations. Christmas in Barcelona has been exceptional due to the incredible staff from front desk, restaurant and housekeeping. You can’t go wrong making this your destination in Barcelona.",5,2023,12,27
14,Comfortable Romantic 3-Night Stay,"I had a great experience at Hotel Neri. Lovely location in Gothic Quarter, highly walkable, though Barcelona is sprawling so public transport is essential if you’re exploring the city. Hotel is very atmospheric, romantic, and comfortable - has a nice lived in quality while still being high quality. There’s a small but soaring lobby and a chic bar/restaurant. I had a Classic room overlooking Plaça de Sant Felip Neri - enjoyed the view. The room and bathroom were comfy, with a great  bed/bedding, white walls a colorful rug, mood lighting, and quiet highly functional AC. The Classic room was a good size, not small. The only thing I didn’t like was that there are no bath products - they put liquid soap, shampoo, etc. in little ceramic jars with covers - tbh, I hated this - difficult to impossible to use in the shower - PLEASE, Hotel Neri, just use normal bottled bath products! Also, my room had a curtain to cover the closet, instead of a door, which at first seemed makeshift, but was fine. Lovely non-fussy turn down service with chocolates. Breakfast was relaxed and worth it, though the bread and pastries are definitely not homemade as they say on the menu. All staff were friendly and accommodating.",5,2023,12,18
14,Fantastic service and comfort ,"This was our first time staying at Hotel Neri, and I would stay here every time we go back to Barcelona. The service is top notch, Tomas and Mauro  made sure we had everything we needed and always greeted us by our names and with a smile.  There was nothing they were not able to help us with. The two made a great team and they made our stay worth even penny. Hotel Neri is located in the Gothic Quarter and walking distance to everything, but if to tired to go out, the restaurant in the hotel is wonderful, and great food. We had a fantastic stay. Thank you to all the staff at Hotel Neri, we will see you again.",5,2023,12,17
14,Perfect location and fantastic staff,"You couldn't ask for a better location than in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.  Everything is within easy walking distance.

The staff all made us feel special and went out of their way to take care of us during our stay.  

We would highly recommend this location",5,2023,12,15
14,EXCELLENT STAY AT HOTEL NERI RELAIS & CHATEAUX,"We stayed in this beautiful hotel for 3 nights at the end of November.  The staff were so kind & helpful particularly George on Reception, Nat & Flavia in the Bar.  The bedrooms and beds were very comfortable.  The hotel is perfect for a city break. ",5,2023,12,04
14,Thank you Hotel Neri!,"Wonderful location, close to a lot of landmarks. Staff at the front desk and breakfast were fantastic. Dario was super helpful and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. Breakfast was delicious and fresh!. The room was impeccable and the building itself has such a charm and history that it is hard to beat.",5,2023,11,30
14,Marvelous experience,"Our week at the Hotel Neri has been a memorable experience. The hotel is walking distance from so many wonderful attractions: the cathedral, the History museum of Barcelona which has an entire archaeological exposition of the Roman ruins beneath the city streets, the archeological exposition of oldest synagogue in Barcelona, the Picasso museum, the seaport, and many superb restaurants including the restaurant here at the hotel. One evening our family had a special dinner in the historic courtyard outside the hotel. 

The streets around the hotel are ancient streets and only open to pedestrians, but close enough to plazas where taxis are abundant.

The staff has been wonderful, attentive to every request. Mauro even arranged transportation for us to be able to go visit and see the birds of the delta del Llobregat one day (a half hour away).",5,2023,11,26
14,Fabulous in Gothic Quarter,"Old & new meet in this fabulous hotel. Very well located in the Gothic Quarter. Staff are friendly and efficient. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. They also have a cute roof terrace, with plunge pool. ",5,2023,11,15
14,Disappointed,"Unfortunately, the room I was given did not comply with my written confirmation which described a room with a view and a double sink.  Our room faced a wall and had one sink with no counter space.  When my husband pointed this out to the front desk they said all superior/delux rooms were different.  I believe that I did not get the room I paid for.  The hotel offered a bottle of cava or a dessert - which I declined.  Very disappointed with this hotel.",2,2023,11,13
14,Perfect retreat in the midst of historic Barcelona!,"Beautiful, historic hotel in old quarter. Rooms were beautiful and service was amazing.  Shout out to Thomas for helping us with all our luggage and making logistics super easy. So close to the action on La Rambla, but an oasis in the middle of history.  Cannot wait to return!",5,2023,11,13
14,Fantastic place to stay in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.,"From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty. Toma, the Bellman, was so helpful and welcoming. Gave us a tour of the property, tips on the city and directions to where we wanted to go.  The rooms were nice, bed was so comfy, especially after a long journey.",5,2023,11,05
14,Aims High but Just Misses,"I know.  Relais and Chateau and only 4 stars?  And it’s fair to point out that we only stayed one night and may not have had the best chance to evaluate.  But hear me out.  First: the much praised in some reviews Thomas.  He greeted us effusively at the door.  But really the first thing he said to me was that I had come the wrong way and should have taken a different route.  Not what I need to hear in that moment.  He was obviously overworked just then with the 11:00 rush but his good cheer seemed to us more affected than effective.  Our need to leave our luggage and check in later, for instance, should not have been so hard to communicate to the person who is evidently the (self-appointed?) face of the place.  We wouldn’t normally single a person out but he is so often mentioned in other reviews this just seems like balance.  And to be clear the other front staff were terrific,  helping effectively with pre-booking a morning taxi and conversing about the cocktail bars in town helpfully and cordially.  

We were in a suite in a building a few metres down the road.  It was spacious but a bit strangely laid out with the washroom as far from the bedroom as could be and an awkward middle of the night grope from the bedroom.   Some of the finishes were a bit rough.  The pool on the roof of our building, when we went to look, had no one there and dirty looking water.  Not inviting at all.  Overall it just felt like a place putting on airs of “finest in the land” but not quite meeting its own mark.  Our 4 stars measures it against its own implied standard and doesn’t find it meets them.  But it is still a very good 4 star spot with a comfortable bed and pillows and turn down service if you like that kind of thing, near the main Ramblas and many other attractions.",4,2023,10,27
14,Gothic Quarter Polished Gem,"The moment Thomas asked me to speak to our cab driver and helped the driver navigate our cab to the square where he greeted us in gregarious fashion, I knew our stay would be good. There we were always around a friendly and attentive staff who helped make our stay delightful. 

We had a short stay but enjoyed the dining which was superb. The staff there were on-point. The food was fabulous. We also enjoyed the room which was very spacious and well appointed. The decor was polished, and I loved learning the history of the courtyard behind it. Eminently walkable to many attractions and the area has the charm of the Gothic Quarter. Don't forget to partake of the gelato shop next to the hotel.

Special thanks to Thomas who was always there with answers to questions and offering assistance at a moment's notice. ",5,2023,10,22
14,Going to Hotel Neri- Thomas is your guy!,"Thomas who does pretty much everything for his guests was truly amazing! He solely made our experience wonderful! He brought our bags from car drop off, showed us all the features of our room, gave us eating recommendations and every time we saw him even if in the city- he would come say Hi and call us by our names! On the way out, he took our bags to car and was a sure delight! He was not an ordinary bellman!",5,2023,10,22
14,Wonderful Stay,"Fantastic welcome from Thomas. Accommodation, food, service and location all excellent. The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and the best hotel pillows ever! An oasis in the middle of this bustling city, would thoroughly recommend",5,2023,10,08
14,Incredible  Amazing Sensational ,"This is a spectacular Hotel !! We stayed 3 nights ,it's centrally located in the Old City ,everything about this Hotel is amazing, primarily the staff are all sensational,special huge  mention to Elida on reception for all you did for us ,your amazing. Ioann on the door who went out of his way always with a smile and Thomas for just being Thomas !! Highly recommended to stay here ...will be back for sure.",5,2023,09,28
14,A Small Palace,Wonderful accommodations and an outstanding staff committed to satisfying hotel guests.  The rooms were comfortable and functional.  An extensive and delicious breakfast were included in the rate.  will be a repeat visitor when returning to Barcelona. ,5,2023,09,27
14,"Beautiful boutique hotel in a desirable area, top notch all around.","We were fortunate to stay at the Neri for 7 delightful nights.  I would definitely recommend coordinating airport transfers with the hotel, it was so simple.  The service from the moment we arrived to our departure was impeccable.   The room was spacious, nice and quiet, even though it faced the courtyard with a school.  The location in the gothic area is fabulous for walking everywhere.  During day 5 of our trip, we picked up a car at the airport.  The hotel was extremely helpful with parking, so much so that on our last day the morning attendant (I wish I knew his name) helped us take our luggage directly to the car in the parking garage.",5,2023,09,15
14,If you want a delightful hotel within walking distance of almost everything....  Neri is your place,"We arrived after a grueling flight and an an even more grueling taxi ride that left us a bit away from our hotel at 1AM.  Fortunately, George, the night attendant, let us in, offered us wonderful cava and soothed our very rumpled nerves.  He took us to our nicely appointed apartment (full cooking facilities) and left us to recover.  The next morning our breakfast (included) confirmed that we had come to the right place!  But, wait, the next day we decided to use those kitchen facilities and bought all sorts of wonderful fresh produce and fish at the amazing market fairly close by.  I was nursing a tennis injury (poor me), so wife Dottie had to head back for more supplies and Julian, sort of a concierge (not sure all he does) would not let her venture out by herself so he accompanied her and helped in the selections!!!  We cooked ourselves a wonderful meal with some wines Julian helped pick out for us.....

In all, the hotel was well appointed, but the caring staff made it a place we will stay every time we are in Barcelona.

JJ & Dottie",5,2023,09,07
14,A royal treat!,"A royal treat! Hotel Neri is home away from home. Staff is exceptional! Very accommodating. And a great location! 
The breakfast every morning is fabulous with fresh Pastries and great coffee.  Hotel Neri is located in a historical sight and the hotel has gone to great lengths to preserve its rich heritage. High ceilings, expansive windows and a modern and spacious bathroom. ",5,2023,09,05
14,Shouldn’t have left,"We immediately regretted leaving this hotel to stay at another Amex Fine Hotels property in Barcelona, in search of a little variety. Hotel Neri offers a calming, tranquil boutique environment off a lovely, quiet square in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. The hotel is very small, so never feels busy or crowded and the staff has time to get to know their guests. The rooms are inviting and well thought-out, and include strange but charming handmade bath products. Breakfast is excellent and huge. Our air conditioner could get the room even too cold, a nice feature not found in many other European hotels that seem to struggle when it gets seriously hot. While the hotel is a little difficult to find via a cab, you’re able to have cars called directly to the door when you’re ready to leave. A special shout out to the bell staff who went above and beyond not only to show us our room and describe the area to us, but also who carried our luggage down to the square when a taxi wasn’t available due to construction.",5,2023,09,03
14,Solid hotel,"Two rooms, for two kids and couple. Not adjoining as it’s small and didn’t work, but all fine. 

Very good a/c. Lovely bathrooms. Lots of good features. Very friendly staff. Incredibly got a taxi to the hotel on departure - wow! High quality and quantity breakfast! 

Fair value in comparison to other hotels. Very good location but quite daunting to find.",5,2023,08,31
14,The best hotel ever! And the staff! So special!!!,"This was THE BEST hotel experience we have ever had. The hotel is lovely, the location is perfect and the staff is OUT OF THIS WORLD! From the minute Thomas came dancing out into the plaza to help us from our taxi I knew we were in for something special. Thomas us a GEM! He walked us all the way to La Boqueria one afternoon so we wouldn’t get lost! Mauro was nothing short of AMAZING. He made our trip so special with his spot on restaurant suggestions and tips about Barcelona. Giovanni made us feel so at home every morning at breakfast. He is so kind- and he remembered all of our favorite things each day. Everyone was so warm and welcoming! We loved EVERY MINUTE of our time at the Hotel Neri. The rooftop pool is a beautiful oasis for a siesta as well!",5,2023,08,30
14,Perfect Barcelona hotel,"This was the perfect city hotel experience. The style, the charm, the location— all perfection, and ESPECIALLY the staff, who made us feel so at home immediately and were so kind. Thomas was so charming & every person working in the hotel was wonderful! Gracias 🙏🏼 ",5,2023,08,22
14,"Beautiful  Stay, home away from home","We are going to remember this stay, made superb by the fantastic staff, from housekeeping to the restaurant and front desk.

 The first welcoming face was Tomas, friendly and very helpful with queries and useful suggestions. 

Mauro, super helpful at check in. 

Restaurant staff, Giovianni, Fernando, Natalia, Ingrid and Zohair and Danny. 

Thank you all, you are a credit to the hotel. I would highly recommend Neri

14,I would highly recommend ..,"Just wanted note how special our stay was made by the fantastic team. Mauro, Thomas and Naiara all worked together to make sure we had everything we needed. As the hotel only has 22 rooms, it is the perfect private break, located in the heart of the gothic quarter. We hardly saw any other guests, it felt very special. Also worth adding breakfast was delicious. Thank you again team!",5,2023,08,09
14,Fantastic hotel! Thomas is amazing!,"The Hotel Neri is a fantastic property with tons of amenities, a great staff, and a fantastic location. Thomas, in particular, who works on the concierge team, is amazing and should be given a promotion. He made our stay perfect from beginning to end with his vibrant, personality, attention, and helpfulness.",5,2023,08,02
14,"An excellent hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter, Barcelona.","An excellent experience in the very heart of the Gothic quarter. The hotel was quaint and very well maintained. The staff were excellent (in particular Thomas the gentleman at the door, Mauro the concierge and the ladies in the restaurant. The plaza behind the hotel is very romantic and quaint. A highly recommended hotel. ",5,2023,07,29
14,Exceptional Service Standards in the Gothic Quarter. ,"An exceptional and unique hotel in the stunning Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. The building originates from the middle ages, but the quality and service are 21st Century 5-star in every respect. I highly recommend the restaurant with Chef Alain Guiard...The food is imaginative and delicious...and don't miss the delightful rooftop pool. The hotel is near many attractions including La Rambla and the amazing Placa Reial. The location can be difficult for taxis to access, so I strongly suggest you arrange transfers through the hotel. If the car cannot reach the door, the hotel staff come to Cathedral Square to help with luggage.  The Neri offers a unique experience in the most charming and historical area of this stunning city.",5,2023,07,24
14,Great hotel with extraordinary service from Thomas!,"Impeccable service, Amazing atmosphere, great location. Thomas was outstanding and always was a friendly face and a great guide; sometimes even leaving the hotel to show us around. Close to the beach, extremely close to Las Rambles, and the pool on the roof was the cherry on top. I recommend this hotel.",5,2023,07,21
14,"Great location, poor staff","Hotel is great location and the facilities are fine but the staff is not professional. Strongly suggest staff training to a level known from hotels in same price level. From reception to restaurant, staff id not trained for this level hotel.",3,2023,07,16
14,Best all-around hotel I've been to,"Nowhere in the world have I been to a hotel that nails every possible aspect like hotel Neri Relais. Mauro at the front desk was the most pleasant and welcoming, and truly an asset in planning our vacation in Barcelona. Rooms are adorable and spacious. The included breakfast is better than you'll find at any of the local restaurants or bakeries. And the location in the gothic quarter is perfect for exploring, finding dive bars with tapas, and feeling a little bit like a local. 

Please stay here if you can.",5,2023,07,12
14,This property will exceed all expectations,"We recently stayed at Hotel Neri. The location is right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Ivan, such a welcoming, warm, helpful and knowledgeable employee. Thomas was another employee who was so above and beyond, he just brought a smile to our faces each time we came and left the property. The hotel was upscale, quiet, clean and safe. The restaurant was beautiful as well, great tapas, cava and the mint ice tea was out of this world!  My only regret is that I couldn't bring their signature scent back to pump through my home! We had the best time in Barcelona and staying at the Hotel Neri certainly added to the experience. This property needs more then 5 stars to do it justice.",5,2023,07,12
14,Awewsome!,"One of the best stays ever! Really stylish hotel with a mixture of modern style in old historic walls. You cannot stay more centric in Barcelona and nevertheless you can rest quietly. The service is very high level, the staff really seem to care about you . By the way, you have to try out the restaurant.  Very special dishes you don't usually find, all delicious and presented in a lovely way.",5,2023,06,24
14,Wonderful service,"Great location, excellent service and friendly staff who make the whole experience a positive and memorable stay. Highly recommend this hotel. What I would improve is the toiletries and shower accessories but overall a great experience ",5,2023,06,20
14,"Historic, hip and perfect.","The location, family room and wonderful team were top notch. Special thanks to tomas, ivan, marina and team - all were warm, welcoming and went out of their way to make our trip smooth and memorable. We stayed in the apts and it was a perfect family experience- especially finishing nights at the plaza in ‘la alcoba azul’ and the wonderful dinner at ‘pla b’-",5,2023,06,13
14,Safety Issue,"This hotel has an outside area where it serves food and beverages.  We spent three nights outside in this area drinking beverages.  Each night the same person came by acting like he was a street person.  Each night the staff saw him and did nothing.  On the third night the ""street person"" put his sign asking for money right in my wife's face with his right hand, and stole my wife's iPhone with his left hand.  Staff did nothing.  We did not feel safe there anymore.  Watch out for pick pockets and thieves - even on the hotel property.",1,2023,06,04
14,Great staff and location,"We had an excellent stay. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, particularly the concierge, Reception and at breakfast/in the bar. 
A great location, in a historic square by the cathedral, which made the city very accessible.
Breakfasts were healthy and generous. We made good use of the bar for pre-dinner drinks and nightcaps, and the roof terrace is an added bonus.
The rooms were spacious and comfortable.
Overall the hotel exceeded our expectations.",5,2023,05,31
14,Poor hotel choice in Barcelona...stay elsewhere,"Despite the high cost and small size, the customer service at this property was very disappointing.  As a small boutique hotel, one would expect customer service to be their competitive advantage.  It was not as we were repeatedly let down by hotel staff on matters such as restaurant reservation assistance and taxi scheduling.  I have stayed at R&C properties all over the world...this one was, by far, the weakest that I have experienced.  Aside from an interesting location, this property has little to recommend it...I urge others to stay elsewhere while visiting Barcelona.  ",1,2023,05,23
14,Favorite Hotel in Barcelona!,"Hotel Neri in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter is an enchanting place that seamlessly combines history and elegance. The restored 12th-century medieval palace and the preserved courtyard are truly remarkable. The rooms are luxurious and comfortable, providing a tranquil retreat. The staff went above and beyond to ensure I had a fantastic stay, offering excellent recommendations and warm hospitality. I loved their entire team but want to give a special shoutout to Thomas and Ivan. Thomas went far above and beyond the call of duty throughout my stay. The hotel's location is perfect for exploring the neighborhood's vibrant atmosphere and discovering Barcelona's treasures. Breakfast is fabulous!",5,2023,05,22
14,"Charming boutique hotel, excellent location & gracious personnel in a historic building","Charming Boutique hotel offering a
Superb location & gracious service in the 
Centrally located Gothic quarter. The historic location was ideal, bounded by Barceloneta, ravel, born and eixample districts.
The hotel personnel graciously helped with extensive planning our first day. (The staff speaks excellent English.)
1. museums that required advance tickets (definitely Sagrada familia, Casa Batllo and Casa Mila aka La Pedera, possibly Picasso and Park Guell also). 
2. advance train tickets to visit Gerona for the day. (Express trains are limited.)
3. Restaurant reservations for lunch and dinners. Even casual restaurants require reservations if you want a sit down lunch. 
4. Guide recommendation: Miquel was knowledgeable but you need to remind him to speak slowly; he has much to share!

By the second day the wait staff knew how I liked my coffee. By the third morning I didn’t have to order it. The waitress made it as I approached. Every staff member was exceedingly polite and pleasant. The hotel food was scrumptious. Two evenings we were too tired from touring and indulged in tapas one night and the a la cart menu another at the hotel restaurant. 
The Concierges were indispensable and deserve a shoutout, as does Tomas, the bellman. 
Natalia and Dario: organized and mapped a walking tour of flea and food markets in different neighborhoods.
Ivan never failed us with his dinner, tapas and paella recommendations. We discussed dining and sightseeing options for almost 15 minutes daily. Our first day, he provided directions to a retailer selling SIM cards, which allowed us to easily navigate the city. He also explained the metro system, which is very clean and easy to use. Although taxis can be called, we preferred the metro.
Elida : recommended some bars for our son that provided music. 
Tomas, bellman, has a wonderfully warm and polite manner. His bright smile welcomed us each day.

It took us a while to find the hairdryer and our hotel slippers in the closet, and to figure out how the electric drying rack in the bathroom worked, but we eventually succeeded.",5,2023,05,20
14,The Ultimate Barcelona Hotel,"From the first moment we entered the hotel, it was service and elegance personified. From Tomas' introduction to the hotel (don't miss the rooftop lounge) to the nightly turndown with chocolate, it was a marvelous stay. We had breakfast INCLUDED and would HIGHLY recommend this -- enough to sustain to dinner [full bread/fruit tray plus eggs, pancakes, etc). Open from 7:30 am to 11am with very attentive staff.  The hotel is VERY WELL LOCATED in the Gothic quarter  -- could walk anywhere from here and a VERY SHORT walk to the square where airport buses and hop-on, hop-off buses. I would DEF stay here again and HIGHLY recommend to others. ",5,2023,05,19
14,Hotel Neri is a gift to travelers ,"A beautiful gem - small yet stunning in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.  The decor was stunning, the staff so accommodating and everything from the quality of the sheets to the cafe con leche in the morning was superb.  It made staying in Barcelona even more wonderful knowing that I was coming back to a beautiful environment.  Thank you Hotel Neri & Staff",5,2023,05,18
14,Wonderful Hotel…A Few Things Could Be Improved,"This is a lovely hotel in a great area. The best part about it is the staff. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. The decor is beautiful and the beds are comfortable. A few things that didn’t work so well for us was that the lighting in the public areas and restaurant is very dark. This made it difficult to read the menus etc.  The other was that the soap, shampoo and conditioner are in ceramic dishes with lids that sit on top. It is very difficult to get the product out of the dish and water gets in the dishes because the lids are not tight fitting. There is also no body lotion but there is some body oil. ",4,2023,05,18
14,Great service,"The service here was fabulous.  Thomas, the bell man, took great care of us and made sure we had everything we needed.  Also, the breakfast staff went out of their way to accommodate my unusual dietary restrictions.  Everyone was very attentive and provided excellent service for all our needs and requests.  It's also very well located to walk out the front door and start sightseeing and exploring.",4,2023,05,17
14,Marvellous stay,"The Hotel Neri is a charming boutique hotel in an excellent and special location in the heart of the Gothic area. The hospitality from each and every staff member is first rate. Thank you to the reception staff for all of your recommendations and arrangements, to Thomas for all your assistance in getting us settled in, and the restaurant and bar staff for top notch service and food. Our stay was an amazing experience and a wonderful welcome to Barcelona and to Spain for our first visit. Muchas gracias. Paul and Barbara from Ottawa Canada.",5,2023,05,14

The breakfast was delicious and the dinner at the Neri was so good!
Felt very safe walking around the Gothic Quarter. 
Tomas and every single employee went out of their way to provide the best service.",5,2023,05,11
14,Great location,"This was our final destination in our Spanish trip. Stayed 4 nights. As with all our Hotels, Hotel Neri was superb.

The Hotel is in the Gothic Quarters.  Our driver had to stop in a plaza nearby and called the Hotel for assistance. That is when we met Tomas who helped with our luggage and in every way possible for the next few days, always with a smile and with a sincere and warm attitude. As did every one else at the Hotel.

Our room had a private patio that we utilized daily. The room was very nice and the bed and pillows were perfect. The location of the Hotel in the ancient quarters allowed us to roam the streets without difficulty. It was also within walking distance of many sites, though the Sagrada Familia was a bit further away.

This place was great.",5,2023,05,05
14,Delightful and charming ,A wonderful boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter in a converted 15-century home with all modern amenities. The staff was very friendly and helpful in securing reservations.  Simply charming and comfortable. I highly recommend. ,5,2023,05,05
14,My new favorite hotel.......,"I think I found my dream hotel!!!  We stayed here for 9 days and enjoyed every minute.  The hotel is in prime Gothic Quarter location. It's welcoming decor and friendly staff are amazing.  The staff is very knowledgeable regarding restaurants, transportation, sites, etc, and assisted us with ticket purchases, reservations, etc. Much thanks to staff--Thomas, George, Ellie, and Ivan.  You made our stay complete.",5,2023,04,23
14,Perfect place to stay in Barcelona,"Truly a magnificent hotel.  An amazing mix of old and new - the building is beautifully historic, but the rooms are very modern and comfortable.  The staff is extremely nice and bent over backwards for our every need.  The area it is located in is in the heart of the Barrio Gotic, with all the narrow windy streets and cool restaurants and shops.  You literally step out the hotel door and you're in the middle of it all.  You're also just a block or so from the Ramblas.  Far enough to not be in the middle of the craziness, but near enough that it's just a couple minute walk away.  There were quite a few restaurants and tapas places just right around the corner too and we ate at a couple that were great.   The restaurant in the hotel is also quite good.  We loved our stay here and I would highly recommend it.",5,2023,04,16
14,Jonathan,"Brilliant location in the Gothic Quarter, great room, excellent service, delicious food and wine. Very comfortable bed and room. Staff are really helpful. Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona. ",5,2023,04,15

The staff has been absolutely lovely.  The rooms are clean, bright and so comfortable.  You truly have everything you need in this hotel!  I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2023,04,14
14,Perfect Stay in heart of Gothic Quarter,"A perfect small hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, just around the corner from Barcelona Cathedral. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had great towels and shower. Despite the central location, our room was very quiet. Tomas was very helpful, even walking us around the area to find stamps on a holiday weekend. Mauro and the other concierge staff made sure we were hooked up with reservations. A wonderful stay - we will be back, and would recommend for couples or families.",5,2023,04,10
14,Simply the best…. ,"Simply the best. We loved every second of the 4 nights we spent at Hotel Neri. The team were so welcoming, spending time talking to us and helping us plan our time in their amazing city. We have to mention Mauro and Thomas and the breakfast team specifically - they all went above and beyond to make this one of our all time favourite city breaks. The breakfasts are out of this world and the rooms are super stylish, spotlessly clean and so comfortable. The Milton Brown products and fresh flowers were a treat too. 

We had an apartment, which was spacious, light and just fabulous. Perfect for the 3 of us.  We also made good use of the roof top terraces  for a quiet drink and rest after a day of sightseeing. 

The hotel’s location in the Gothic area of the city suited us perfectly as we loved wandering around finding little squares and finding fabulous little cafes and independent shops to mooch in. 

That said, the hotel is ideally placed to explore the whole city either on foot or on the Barcelona Touristic buses, which we recommend highly. We saw a huge amount and fell in love with Barcelona. 
One thing to note is to book ahead for some of the main attractions to avoid disappointment and some offer discounts if you book online. And the bus company offer coupons too, so make use of them. While you can’t be short of things to see and do, in our opinion the tour of Sagrada Família is an absolute must. It’s simply breathtaking. 

We couldn’t have asked for a better trip and Hotel Neri, thank you. We will be back, ",5,2023,04,10
14,"Don’t think, just book!!! Best hotel in Barcelona!","We had the best stay at Hotel Neri- from the moment we were greeted to the transfer to the airport. We absolutely loved our Neri family! 

The hotel is a beautiful, small boutique, in the heart of the gothic quarter. It has a modern flair without losing its classic European charm. 

Thomas and Ivan - thank you so much for your warm hospitality during our entire stay. I knew from the second we arrived, we were in the right place because of how helpful and friendly you both were. You both went above and beyond in making our time in Barcelona amazing!

Sandra and Marina and the entire bar/restaurant staff were all incredible. We loved every drink, fun conversation and recommendations in experiencing Barcelona the right way. I will cherish every laugh and carajillo I’ve had at the bar with you all!

Muchas gracias from us all! We cannot wait to return to Barcelona and stay at Hotel Neri!!",5,2023,04,04
14,Beautiful hotel in the center of the city ,"The Hotel Neri is centrally located in the old city, just steps from the cathedral, with its own quiet square for its excellent restaurant. Two nearby metro stops will wisk you away to just about anywhere in the city. Lovely artwork adorns the walls and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. The staff is excellent, with the legendary doorman Thomas setting the standard for attentiveness. Our only complaint is that the room was too dark. Our room had a deck with an outside shower (too cold to use in March) but the privacy fence blocked out a lot of the sunlight and the room did not have enough lighting to mmake up for that. The reading lights at the bed were inadequate if you wanted to be old-fashioned and read a book; we need to use our phone flashlights! But that problem  aside, I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,04,03
14,Wonderful stay,"Our four night stay at the Hotel Neri was outstanding. The staff was friendly, always available at just the right time and went to great lengths to help us with everything we needed (dinner reservations, laundry, directions, etc.). The hotel itself is lovely--the stone staircase, warm lighting, soft jazz music, and scented candles set the tone for our romantic and very enjoyable stay. We loved that it is hidden away on a tiny little street deep in the gothic quarter. The location is exceptional. Within a 5 to 15 minute walk, we reached roman walls, cathedrals, the markets, marina, Gaudi's houses and many great shops. We enjoyed the restaurant and appreciated a nightcap at the bar after a day of exploring. Our room was quiet except for the occasional laughter of school children in the court below--which we loved. We also enjoyed the rooftop terrace and cocktails at sunset while church bells rang. We can't recommend the hotel highly enough and will definitely stay here again when we return. ",5,2023,04,02
14,Excellent Location,We enjoyed the excellent location and attentive service at this hotel in a quiet enclave in the Barri Gothic. The apartment had plenty of room for our family of three. The included breakfast was a quiet and elegant way to start each day. ,5,2023,04,02
14,Favorite Hotel EVER,"Check all the boxes, Nuri was a hidden gem in the most amazing quarter of this beautiful and historic city. As you walk the the maze of high walled cobblestoned roads around the oldest Cathedral, you turn a corner and the glass doors of this beautiful but unassuming boutique hotel surprise you… oh it’s here. It was easily our favorite stay. The hotel pulls you into the history that is Barcelona… it was actually part of the Nuri family castle. 

Taxis CAN actually take you to to and from the front door, although you feel like you are break some law’s getting there. We thought it was the cleanest and quickest part of the city, but right there in the historic center.

Service was over the top. Restaurant was a destination for spot with great views of the castle courtyard. The breakfast was better than the 5 star hotels in my foodie city, New Orleans, served not buffet.

On top of all that, it is an amazing value with the Amex Fine Hotel benefits. 

Friendly, accommodating, quiet, clean, appointed, helpful, delicious, central, historic, unique!",5,2023,03,29
14,We can’t wait to return!,"Intimate, chic, luxurious boutique hotel with excellent service. From the moment we arrived, we felt at home (better than home!). They took great care of us especially informing us of the daylight saving time change which is on a different date than the US. Shout outs to George, Mauro and Victoria at the front desk, Thomas at the front door and Joaquin, Daniel, Ingrid and the rest of the staff at the restaurant—where the food was fantastic!",5,2023,03,25
14,One of the best in Barcelona,"Second time I’ve stayed at the hotel, NERI and I cannot fault it in anyway whatsoever as always the staff were wonderful breakfast very nice room excellent. Look forward to returning. I also had lunch yet which was very enjoyable. This is a good all round torch off. I thank you again HOTEL Neri  and I look forward to returning sometime in the future.. good good 😊",5,2023,03,20
14,"Lovely Hotel, Exceptional Service","Booked Hotel Neri for our city break in Barcelona based on location and on the excellent reviews. They were not wrong. 
Small hotel (only 22 rooms) so feels very special to stay there. From the moment we checked in to well after we checked out, the service and helpfulness of the staff was amazing. 
Nice room. Small but well appointed with a small balcony. Bed was very comfortable. 
We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast and also tried the food at night. Would definitely recommend. 
What really made our stay were the staff - Mauro on reception, Ingrid and Marina in the bar/restaurant and of course Thomas the concierge extraordinaire. 
The day we left to go to the airport coincided with the Barcelona marathon making access for taxis etc impossible. Huge thank you to everyone involved in finding a taxi that could take us and especially to Thomas who walked us and our luggage to the meeting point.",5,2023,03,19
14,Disappointed,"Hotel Neri. Location stunning Hotel inside was beautiful.  We however found the food lacking in flavour and choice. Breakfast we were not given choice of fruit or juice just told what we were getting and that we were allowed to choose two other items!! We found most of the staff lovely but a couple in the bar were a bit sharp and condescending sadly. We were promised a surprise for our celebration but it did not show up. Sadly we would not return because of it feeling a bit pretentious. I felt like the ethos was  we were lucky to be there and that we were getting what they wanted to give us, not what we wanted which left us not wishing to return as it was not cheap. Hotel Royal Passeige de Gracia was much nicer room, view and hospitality for less money.",3,2023,03,14
14,A perfect stay in the heart of the Gothic Quarter!,"A perfect stay! If you are looking for a quiet, beautiful place to stay in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, this is it!

Each morning we were served fresh fruits, breads, jams, juice, coffee and on top if that we could each choose two entrees!  There is so much history in Barcelona and I felt like we were in the heart of it all!",5,2023,03,02
14,"Gothic and welcoming, what a combo!","We picked this hotel because it was in such a beautifully renovated gothic building. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it had so much more to offer. The staff here was phenomenal! A lot of 5 star hotels encourage their people to be courteous but aloof, here everyone was kind, welcoming, funny and friendly. From the manager to the bartenders everyone at this boutique hotel was wonderful!

If you visit I guarantee you will be charmed by Thomas, the hotel’s concierge/doorman/porter/ambassador and all around delightful human being. He helped us with anything we needed and always greeted us warmth. 

Giovanni was another highlight of our trip. He took care of us every morning at breakfast and we exchanged stories about having both lived in New York. He couldn’t have been more lovely.",5,2023,02,20

14,"Fabulous location, good restaurant and bar,  corner Jr. Suite 107, helpful staff, horrible lighting","My wife and I stayed for 9 night at the Hotel Neri.  The hotel staff were always available and extremely helpful.  We wanted to see parts of Barcelona that tourists don't regularly go to, and their advice was spot on (and charming locations), they suggested lovely restaurants at all price points, and helped us with ticketing for various museums and cathedrals.  We had an utterly delightful Jr. Suite (107) on the first floor.  It was somewhat noisy, but that didn't bother us in the least.  What was a problem was the lighting.  Both the room and the bathroom were so dim you couldn't see a thing (thank goodness for iPads) even on a bright sunny day, the room was dark.  Adding better lighting through the use of lamps would have been really helpful.  The room was lovely, but it grew quite tiresome not being able to see anything.",4,2023,02,19

14,Gothic Quarter Gem,"Can’t say enough about Hotel Neri - it’s a stones throw from the gorgeous Cathedral of Barcelona and spectacular Gothic Quarter - and is absolutely gorgeous. The hotel is packed with history and charm and the staff could not have been lovelier. Thomas was there every day with a smile on his face and suggestions to help us navigate our day.  Actually, all the staff was lovely and super helpful with ticket and car needs. And don’t forget to have a vermouth or cava at the bar before enjoying a gourmet meal in the restaurant either inside or in the historic Plaza de San Felipe Neri. We were lucky enough to stay at Hotel Neri during the Saint Eulalia celebration where the Parade of Giants and ‘human towers’ happened right around the corner - such a fantastic trip!",5,2023,02,15

- $100USD food & beverage credit
- Welcome gift (delicious bottle of wine)

- Our room was large and wonderful, with a view overlooking Plaça de Sant Felip Neri. 
- Bathroom had an excellent shower/bath. 
- Bed was super comfortable. 
- We were able to plug our Roku into the television. 
- Internet was fast

The quality of service at Neri cannot be understated. From check-in, to restaurant, to everyone else we interacted with at the hotel. While at larger hotels you can often feel like just a number, at Neri you truly feel like a guest!",5,2023,01,25
14,A Home in Barcelona,"Well hidden boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. The receptionist with his calm and kind welcome was gracious and very helpful. I could have sworn that he would have made a great cast member in a movie about bespectacled intellectuals which I am sure he is. He recommended their Christmas Eve dinner that was a feast to delight in. The rooms are very clean and tastefully decorated. The service from the staff was to say the least incredible including arranging offsite activities. Thank you Thomas C for going out of your way severally. Miguel in the dining and the Neri team, thank you for your hospitality and kindness. ",5,2023,01,15
14,Perfection in the Gothic Quarter,"The perfect location for exploring Barcelona's Gothic Quarter and Las Ramblas.

14,THE PERFECT HOTEL,"We just finished spending 4 glorious days in Barcelona and one of the highlights was staying at the Neri in the Gothic quarter. It is an outstanding small luxury hotel and the staff is professional, helpful and awfully nice. The rooms are very well appointed, with a very comfortable bed and spectacular bathroom.  The restaurant and bar serve wonderful food and libations and the historic courtyard is a magical place to relax. The neighborhood is beautiful and historic which added to our bliss. We can’t wait to return to this very beautiful and special place.",5,2023,01,06
14,Final leg of Spain holiday trip,"We booked Hotel Neri through American Express Fine Hotel & Resorts and it definitely lived up to the category.  We had a beautiful large room with a small couch overlooking the quaint back neighborhood courtyard.  The bathroom was spacious with double sinks, a large shower and window. There were robes (bonus!) and slippers as well. A bottle of wine was waiting for us in our room. Turn down service included chocolates and a very sweet NYE treat bag. Out three teenage sons had a cute apartment across the small street/alley in the Casa Neri building.  Both buildings had rooftop decks. 
The breakfast was amazing - so much wonderful food. 
We enjoyed our three nights there very much and want to give a huge shout out to Tomas.  He met us at our drop off to assist with out luggage (the hotel is located on a small street/alley that is difficult for vans to access), greeting us with a smile and welcoming us to Barcelona.  He offered us drinks while we waited for our rooms in the lobby library area. 
Tomas went above and beyond to make our stay so pleasant.  He speaks 8 - yes 8!! - languages and was so professional and accommodating.  He made us feel like priority guests and we appreciated  everything he did to enhance our visit.
Hotel Neri is a great hotel in a very central location and was the perfect place to end our Spain holiday.",5,2023,01,04
14,Relais Chateau???,Incredible location in heart of Gothic Quarter.  Staff were excellent.  Good on-site restaurant/bar.  Room smelled like smoker previously stayed.  Water ran out of shower onto floor and flooded bathroom.  Had to ask for promised restaurant discount to be applied at check-out and amenities to be replenished during stay.   Maybe a four-star hotel at definitely a five-star price.,3,2022,12,27
14,"Great location, rooms and staff, however..","A hidden gem in Barcelona’s gothic section with contemporary and well appointed rooms and delightful and professional staff. Unfortunately our room was just above the “recovered old courtyard “ and area immediately adjacent to the bar and surrounded by other tall structures. This design amplifies the sound of both the bar patrons and other miscellaneous obviously loud drunks until 1-2 in the morning, every day. The hotel is likewise adjacent to the Barcelona Cathedral whose bells ring on the hour and every quarter hour.  Even heavy sleepers may be challenged.  
   The bar/restaurant was fine as long as your order didn’t involve cooking. Fruits, breads, and shaved meats were excellent but a simple omelette was undercooked and greasy.  We likewise found the evening menu limited. The helpful staff will make restaurant reservations elsewhere for you and you should take them up on it.  
    I really wanted to love this hotel but the noise and lack of a quality restaurant causes hesitation.",4,2022,12,18
14,Wonderful people working at the hotel! ,"Hotel Neri is a an absolute wonderful place stay. Our family of 4 (including 7 year old daughter and 8 month old son), were greeted with such friendliness and were accommodated through our our 6 night stay.  Elida at reception was such a help when we had to rent a car at the last minute, and always made time to say hello when we entered the hotel. Angela, Miguel, and Giovanni in dining shared tips for sightseeing and always had a smile for our kids, no matter how busy they were in service. Our apartment style room was very comfortable and the cleaning staff always made sure to provide us with what we asked. We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Neri and will definitely be recommending it to friends and family visiting Barcelona. Thanks again Hotel Neri for a great vacation! ",5,2022,12,12

We ate breakfast (included in our stay) and lunch once at 'A' Restaurant on the ground floor, which was excellent. The staff was extremely welcoming, fun to speak with, and more than helpful. The immediate area around the hotel is a little quieter at night, but just a few steps away from all the restaurants and shopping you could ever want.

14,Great hotel and location,Excellent hotel in the heart of the Gothic centre.   Staff were excellent and very knowledgable.  We stayed in an  apartment which was great for a family and very spacious .   Food was  superb and the hotel was spotless. Highly recommend this hotel,5,2022,10,30
14,Great four night stay,"Just had a beautiful four night stay at the hotel nearly could not fault the staff especially Giovanni at breakfast and Thomas front of door the rooms are really nice and clean beautiful bedding lovely shower and the hotel is very quiet I would recommend this hotel to anyone and it’s wonderfully centrally located, personally for us and we stayed in Barcelona many times and we travel a bit it’s one of the best hotels we have been in .",5,2022,10,29
14,Perfect Stay in Barcelona,"This hotel is beautiful and unique.  It is a true luxury property.  The rooms and beds were so comfortable.  We had a junior suite and it was very spacious, clean and comfortable.  The hotel is quiet too.  The service was exceptional.  The people at the front desk were so warm and friendly and eager to fulfill every request no matter the time of day or night.  The food and service in the restaurant was also exceptional.  The breakfasts were a daily highlight of our trip.  The hotel was everything we had hoped it would be.  ",5,2022,10,21
14,Perfect location in the heart of historic Barcelona,Boutique hotel in the middle of the Gothic Quarter. Walking distance to everything. Well appointed rooms and common areas. Nice restaurant but lots of other food options nearby. Attentive and helpful staff. Lovely rooftop area but no onsite food or drink service   ,4,2022,10,09
14,Excellent!,"We've been staying there for years and we still enjoy it. It is getting a bit worn down but the service is still first rate and friendly, the location is perfect for exploring as it is in the Bari Gothic just steps away from the cathedral and they have a charming cafe/restaurant ""a"" attached. It is a Relais & Chateaux property and highly recommended.",5,2022,10,07
14,A Lovely Few Days in a Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at the Hotel Neri for four days at the end of a month of travel in Spain.  We’d booked a deluxe room with a wraparound terrace on the third floor.  

Many hotels these days refer to themselves as “boutique hotels” - a term that has really been rendered meaningless through misuse.  The Hotel Neri is a “boutique hotel” as that term was initially intended.  It’s small (twenty-something rooms spread over three floors in a medieval palace in the heart of the Barri Gotic.  It’s chic - elegant modern design in furnishings, carpets, artwork, etc.  It’s exceedingly well run by top-notch staff (Elida at reception deserves a special call-out).  And lastly, the Hotel Neri’s guest rooms are what hotel rooms should be in a big city like Barcelona - a cool and very comfortable place to retreat to at the end of a busy day of walking and museum/gallery visiting.  As the weather was quite warm during our stay, we very much enjoyed the terrace, where we ate breakfast in the morning and had a glass of wine in the evening.  The bedroom was large, bright and comfortably and stylishly furnished.  The compact bathroom was a little short on space to put one’s toiletry bag, etc. but that’s a minor quibble.  All in all, we had a really lovely few days at the Hotel Neri and we’d certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a small, high caliber hotel in Barcelona’s Barri Gotic.",5,2022,10,06
14,The epitome of service and quality,"Neri is always a top experience. The staff provides unbelievable service, that is still understated and unobtrusive. The history, tranquility, food and drink and overall friendliness of everyone there makes it among my favorite hotels I have ever visited. I recently traveled with my parents (who are older and need a little extra assistance) and the staff made our stay seamless and full of fun. No matter how long my stay is at Neri its always too short.",5,2022,10,05
14,Wonderful Stay,The facilities were better than expected and the staff extraordinary!!  Dinner in the restaurant was magnificent and the location perfect..  Thanks to Ivan and especially Oskar for helping us weave our way through the La Merce festivities to catch a taxi was a blessing!!  Definitely worth a return visit!!,5,2022,10,05
14,Fantastic hotel,Just come back from a 5 night stay at the Hotel Neri & could not have been more impressed. The hotel staff & location made this an unbelievable stay as everyone was so helpful from start to finish. A special mention to Tomas & all the cleaning staff who did our room twice a day to an impeccable standard.,5,2022,10,04
14,"Hotel Neri, Barcelona","The Hotel Neri is truly a gem.  Small—30 rooms—with a terrific bar restaurant.
Located in the Gothic district..no cars.  Walk everywhere…
The staff is the absolute best—personable, attentive, arrange for anything—-restaurants, etc.
Highest recommendation",5,2022,09,20
14,Wonderful quiet hotel in Barcelona,"Stayed here again recently, and I just love this hotel.  It's right near the Cathedral, but on a secluded and quiet side street. You'd never find it if you didn't know it was there.  The staff is so nice.  The location is ideal, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. 

Our room was spacious and quiet.  AC was great.  I should note that there is a grade school on the square, but it's only busy after like 9 AM on weekdays. 

I love this hotel, and would highly recommend it.",5,2022,09,18
14,Special!,"Beautiful hotel in perfect location!
Fabulous breakfast!
Mauro, Dario, Marina & Tomas were beyond friendly & helpful!
All hotel staff everywhere in the world should learn from them!
They made a special difference in our stay!",5,2022,09,17
14,"Charming boutique hotel, nice room, great location, exceptionally helpful staff","We tried to get a reservation here  two months before traveling, but just got shut out. So we reserved at another excellent looking hotel - bigger, beautiful, in Eixample. But i kept checking back to see if Neri had a cancellation. And one week before we left, they did! So I grabbed the room quickly.

It has made all the difference! If you don't want to stay in the crowded old city, forget the rest. Otherwise, this is the place. Many spots are nearby, and even the great Gaudi casas are a 20-25 minute walk.

The staff was exceptionally helpful in getting tickets, dinner reservations, etc., all with kindness and even JOY! Our especial favorite is George, though all personnel were great. 

There is a school in the Placa, but if the sound of little children laughing disturbs you, the windows when closed are double soundproofed.

One caveat: The breakfast, paid in advance, amounts to a rather expensive fruit and bread tray, with eggs, etc. extra.",5,2022,09,14
14,"Run, don’t walk to book this hotel!","Can’t rave enough about this place! A true five star experience from check in to check out. My husband and I kept saying how much we loved this place and can’t wait to come back to visit Barcelona and stay at Hotel Neri again! We opted to stay in the apartments that are right next to the hotel and were so glad we did. It was such a beautiful oasis, quiet, tranquil, and the perfect room to come back to after a long day of sightseeing, shopping, or whatever. There is a private pool that only the apartment guests have access to that was so peaceful and quiet. Have to give a shout out to Thomas who was a rockstar bellman. He took such great care of us during our stay! Everything about this hotel is so thoughtfully curated and geared towards sustainability. Such an incredible experience!!",5,2022,09,13
14,Great hotel and a great Waitress,"As an appreciative guest in the 5 star industry, I would like to congratulate Marina on her great work. I enjoyed her professionalism and her smile very much. Also always let guests enjoy just a drink on your beautiful terrace, thank you",5,2022,09,12
14,Amazing stay at Neri!,"Had the most beautiful stay at hotel Neri these past few days. All of the staff went above and beyond to make our stay really special, in particular Mauro, Tomas and Marina. The attention to detail was excellent, the food was beautiful and we felt really at home. Thank you so much to everyone at hotel Neri.",5,2022,08,31
14,Great stay at Neri,"We absolutely loved it, the staff are great. Mauro and Marina and Thomas- thank you!! The rooms are fantastic. We had breakfast every morning and the food was delicious. I can’t recommend the hotel enough!!",5,2022,08,31
14,Lovely hotel with the warmest welcome. Faultless friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel during our entire stay.,"A two minute walk from the Cathedral, we stayed for three nights over the Bank Holiday weekend in this wonderful hotel in the Gothic Quarter of the city… a delightful mix of old and new, clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated throughout. We had a full breakfast included in our stay and managed to accommodate all our dietary requirements. The turn down service in the evening was a delightful touch. The one thing that turned this hotel from a good find to an exceptional one was the staff. We received the warmest welcome on arrival, a lovely cooling drink too. The reception, restaurant and cleaning staff were very polite, friendly and accommodating - absolutely nothing was too much trouble. We will definitely be back…",5,2022,08,30
14,Gorgeous Luxury Hotel!!,"I recently visited Hotel Neri with my mum for a girls trip away…the staff went above and beyond to help us with amazing local recommendations and were so friendly (especially Thomas!) Fabulous service including sending me a birthday surprise to my room to help me celebrate! We couldn’t fault our room and overall experience. We loved relaxing at the rooftop pool and our breakfast every morning was delicious!! We’re already planning our next trip back! 

Thank you Hotel Neri!",5,2022,08,30
14,A hidden gem in the centre of Barcelona,"From the moment we entered the property we were made to feel so special. The staff were all amazing (including Thomas who was very efficient). I have nothing bad to say at all, we stayed two nights pre Med cruise and it was a very special start to our holiday. Rooms have lovely comfortable beds, Molton Brown toiletries and plenty storage.Just five minutes walk from the hustle and bustle but a very tranquil beautiful setting. There is even a cheeky wee roof top plunge pool with bar service.",5,2022,08,28
14,Superb small hotel,"The staff at the hotel couldn't have been more helpful. The location is very good and many of the sights were within walking distance. Beautifully decorated historic building.
All in all a great hotel to stay in Barcelona.",5,2022,08,24
14,A fantastic hotel,"I have recently returned from staying at this beautiful hotel. The hotel is excellently positioned in the Gothic Quarter close to many of the must see sights. The room was stunning, spacious and clean with everything you could need. The beds were very comfortable which was needed after a long day of walking and sight seeing. 

The staff are very friendly and helpful offering advice and recommendations for places to eat and visit. Going out of their way to help.  I was very sad to leave and would definitely visit again.",5,2022,08,24
14,Stunning Hotel,"Stunning hotel and excellent service. Location couldn't be better. Hotel interior is lovely. Breakfast was superb. Truly a 5 star experience. Staff were brilliant also, specially Thomas who is a great character. Pool on the roof was also really great. ",5,2022,08,20
14,Fabulous hotel,"I went with my two sons to the Hotel Neri this summer and we loved it.  Small intimate boutique hotel in a great setting (Gothic quarter).  Service was great, the rooms were great and the restaurant is fantastic.  We have had the good fortune of staying in many nice hotels over the years and this one is up there.   Staff also is very friendly and eager to help from Tomas to the front desk folks.  Thanks Hotel Neri for a wonderful stay!",5,2022,08,14
14,Enchanting calm hotel minutes from Las Ramblas,"What a gorgeous hotel, we had a fantastic stay here in August. The staff were extremely accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. The front desk booked all our restaurant bookings and their recommendations were perfect. The location is a 10 minute walk from everywhere and the nearest metro is 5 minutes walk away. This is our fifth visit to Barcelona but when we come next time, we will definitely book Hotel Neri again. The breakfast trays were fab too especially sitting out in the courtyard. What a relaxing, calm break in the middle of busy Barcelona.",5,2022,08,07
14,"Family of 5 in Neri Apartments, fabulous stay","We had a wonderful stay at the Neri apartments with our family of 5 (kids aged 11, 14, 16).  Previous reviews mention all the fabulous things about the location and amenities which we agree, so I will only add the bits about travelling with a family of 5, since we find it hard to get accommodation to suit us.  We had 2 aprtments on the same floor - with their own lockable doors (organised directly with hotel via email prior to booking).  There are only 2 apartments on each floor which when we were there, we left our doors open to go in and out to each other.  Other people staying in the apartments needed their key to access the building and the lift, although they could reach our floor and our open doors via lift - which was fine as we only left them open when home.  Both rooms had a washing machne/dryer comb and washing liquid which was great for our family holiday.  Each room had a king bed and very large sofa which converted to a bed.  Thus our children all had their own bed - one in a king and the other 2 on a pull out sofa each.  The apartments also share a fabulour roof top pool which was lovely.  Due to the narrow streets and them being blocked off, we had the hotel arrange our transfers and this was perfect as they came to a nearby street/square to help us load and unload our luggage.  Staff were very knowledgeable and helpful.  Exceptional location, can thoroughly recommend and we hope to stay again.",5,2022,07,22
14,Elizabeth D.,"I cannot speak highly enough of hotel Neri and their staff. They provided superb care and service, which was especially helpful and appreciated because we had an unexpected health challenge during our stay. The staff were so kind, supportive, and helpful during our vulnerable experience. In addition to this, their  service regarding typical needs such as transportation to the airport, dinner reservations, help with taxis… were perfect. They provided such kindness and detailed care and service that I felt as if we were staying with family. The staff also seemed like family amongst themselves.  They had a camaraderie and sense of reliability and kinship amongst themselves, that is rare to witness. It speaks volumes about the leadership and culture at this hotel. Finally, the location was fantastic, our room and the common areas of the hotel were beautiful, and their living garden on the rooftop was a serene oasis. Thank you to the wonderful people at hotel Neri. A special thank you to Dario, Ioan, Marro, Thomas, Claire, Joseline, Giovani, Fernando, Marina and Sandra. 
Elizabeth D.",5,2022,07,19
14,Luxury In the heart of Barcelona,"A tucked away location in the busy Gothic Quarter, you are transported to a luxury stay with Hotel Neri.  The beds alone are worth the stay.  The room was as comfortable as it was luxurious, and it was quiet considering the bustling neighbourhood surrounding.  A family room was a fantastic bonus to our stay as we could move between rooms with both privacy and freedom. ",5,2022,07,15
14,Super Hotel,"Great location, elegant property, fantastic stay.  Stayed at the W and the Arts and would recommend Neri over them albeit a much smaller boutique hotel and a bit of a walk to the beach. The Gothic Quarter is a great community ",5,2022,07,12
14,The best place to stay in Barcelona,"Hotel Neri is stunning.  Staff is charming, service is impeccable, location is perfect.  Rooftop pool and garden offer a beautiful oasis.  Balcony was amazing.  Amenities were wonderful and of the highest quality.",5,2022,07,09
14,the most wonderful stay!,"Hotel Neri exceeded all expectations. I highly recommend you enjoy at least one night in this quiet, comfortable, and lovely hotel. Everything from the staff, the rooftop pool and quality of food was perfect . ",5,2022,07,06
14,Terrific Hotel in the Heart of the Gothic District,"We had a marvelous time at Hotel Neri before our cruise.  The hotel is perfictly situated in the Gothic quarter, close to Las Ramblas, shopping and restuarants.  We stayed in the apartments which is in a separte building just down the street.  The apartment was well appointed with a kitchen and washer/dryer which came in handy as our flight was delayed and we had no baggage for a day.  The concierge team helped us tremendously retrieving our luggage and could not have been more accomodating.  Breakfast was excellent.   The hotel is one a narrow ally and sometimes cabs may not be accessible, but if not, they will let you off/pick you up at a square down the street and the hotel will help with luggage.",5,2022,06,29
14,An outstanding Hotel which made my holiday !,"I stayed for four nights with my family of six and I can say, hand to heart, that this is one of the VERY best hotels I’ve ever visited (and i stay at all the usual four seasons/MO/Ritz/ etc given  how much I travel) 

The rooms are good, bedding is awesome and amenities also. The place generally exudes a quiet sense of class and serenity - if there was the sound of running water in the lobby it would feel like a luxury spa. 

But what truly distinguishes this hotel is the outstanding people who work tirelessly to make you feel at home.Thomas at the entrance was a firecracker full of local tips even though he’s from the Caribbean!  Giovanni and Marina made our amazing morning breakfasts even better. Hospitality here could put many of those super-luxe resorts in Asia to shame! Dario and Victoria helped us settle in and figured out a last-minute booking at an amazing restaurant for my son’s 18th when my own booking fell through. The hotel also found us a very reasonable hourly taxi who took all six of us to cover the many last minute items we had to get from everywhere across town (salsa shoes anyone ?) Ivan made sure my kids got home safely from a club - (including giving them stern stay outta trouble tips!) These are just some examples and there were many!

At the end of the trip, Mauro took a personal interest in making sure we got to the airport on time. He sensed that something wasn’t quite right with the transfers I had booked & boy was he right! Luckily for us, he and George stayed with us and our bags: the original van did a no-show and Mauro quickly got us two taxis instead. Note that we had already checked out, so whatever happened was no longer the hotel’s business… but they made it their business and all I can say is thank you!

All in a really special place with an excellent service culture that makes it truly unique.  We look forward to coming to Barcelona again and staying with you!",5,2022,06,26
14,Hotel Neri in Barcelona - Excellent,"My husband and I stayed a few nights in one of the apartments at Hotel Neri and it exceeded expectations. The accommodations are clean and modern, and the apartment setting makes you feel like a local but housekeeping is provided by the hotel so you are never without a tidy home. The private pool for apartment guests is intimate and refreshing after a hot day strolling Barcelona. The location is perfect - just make sure you are able to carry your luggage a short distance as cars do not have access to the immediate area. Last but certainly not least, the staff is absolutely wonderful. Attentive, kind and generous, Mauro gave us an excellent recommendation for pinxtos and Thomas treats you like a VIP. Would absolutely recommend to couples who want to feel like they are in the middle of everything with comfortable accommodations and first-class service.",5,2022,06,24
14,Amazing hotel in great location—staff is exceptional,"The hotel staff here is truly exceptional—so friendly, kind and professional. The hotel is in a beautiful building with a rich history, and the rooms are so pretty and quiet, with climate control and a great shower & bed. The restaurant if you choose to eat there is amazing, but there are so many incredible restaurants and cafes around that you may not even have time to eat there! The location is very walkable to so many cool places. Definitely stay here.",5,2022,06,23
14,Couldn't have been any better.!!!,"Absolutely wonderful hotel. A tranquil haven to return to after a long day of sight seeing, sweet smelling of aromatherapy candles in the cool covered courtyard reception.
Service was second to none, nothing was too much trouble. The room had everything from the gorgeous Molten Brown toiletries , to the outside bath to cool off in. The beds were really comfortable with luxury cotton sheets, beautiful bathroom with stone tiles and double sink.
The pool area on the roof was relaxing and had call bells for waiter service, straight to your seat.
The concierge was amazing , recommending places to eat, where to go, ordering taxis and booking tables.
Special mention must go to Ivan and Mauro who went above and beyond.
If we had to say anything negative it would be the availability of a courtesy room to change for late flights.
But other than that , excellent!!!!!",5,2022,06,21
14,Location and Service Excellence!,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel Neri.  Coupled with a great location( you can walk to all major attractions) and the “gold standard” of service, it was an outstanding visit.  The entire staff, from the front desk, the breakfast server(Marina), everyone was focused on 100% guest satisfaction.

They assisted us with Covid tests before our cruise, and the convenience of having the test done at the hotel was easy.

Restaurant was very good with a strong lineup of tapas and excellent wine selection.  Overall a great experience!",5,2022,06,18
14,An absolutely excellent experience,"This was one of the best hotel experiences I’ve ever had. The property is beautiful and everything is well appointed. The bed was perhaps the most comfortable bed I’ve slept in, and definitely the best sleep I’ve ever had at a hotel. The rooms are very quiet, except some occasional noise from the small streets which are generally quiet. The staff is exceptional: kind and helpful, every interaction with them was pleasant. The food at the property is also delicious. ",5,2022,06,12
14,As good as everyone says.,"great little gem of a property. quirky, beautiful and hidden behind the main Cathedral in the Gothic Quarter. probably one of the most comfortable beds i've slept in, full stop.

staff goes above and beyond to be helpful in any way they can. breakfast is a generous affair: they bring you a personal mini buffet, and then tell you to order whatever you want from the menu, as many as you want. just luxurious beginning to end.

only note would be the rooftop area/pool: they need to figure out a way to keep the pigeons at bay.",5,2022,06,09
14,Lovely Time in the Gothic Quarter,"Hotel Neri was absolutely fantastic. The building is lovely and the staff took care of everything we asked for. Their recommendations for local restaurants were spot on, and Thomas even walked with us and our luggage to get a local taxi. We loved our trip to Hotel Neri and will return.",5,2022,06,04
14,Fantastic stay - so glad to be back,"Our third time at the Neri (would have been five but for you know what!) and so glad to be back, cosseted and superbly looked after at the Neri. From the greeting at the front desk on arrival to the personal attention at breakfast and dinner, the awesome comfortable beds and the lovely roof terrace for relaxation, loved every moment. Now looking forward to our next trip!",5,2022,06,04
14,Well worth the stay in the apartments,"We stayed in the apartments, not the main hotel, and it was incredible. We joked we'd honestly live there. Comfortable, well-designed, great location, and regular hotel amenities are only a phone call away (like room service, etc). ",5,2022,05,31
14,Outstanding Choice - Location &  Quality,"A truly great hotel in the perfect location! Highly recommended...5 stars.

Located a couple hundred yards from the main Cathedral, this hotel is the perfect spot to explore the Gothic Quarter.  Everything is in walking distance - plazas, monuments, restaurants....

First class hotel with an outstanding staff!  Great onsite restaurant...and a rooftop lounge & pool.

Would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2022,05,25
14,"Perfect Stay, First Class Service","We recently spent three nights at the Hotel Neri in the apartment complex (a few steps down from the main hotel).  The hotel itself is first class and is located deep in the Gothic Quarter, close to all of the sites in that area.  What set Neri apart however, was its staff.  From Thomas to all of the desk representatives, they all exceeded our expectations; providing great restaurant recommendations, arranging for walking tours and transport.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,18
14,Amazing hotel in heart of Barri Gotic!,"I just stayed at Hotel Neri for four nights and had a wonderful experience.
The check in was very smooth and the staff made us truly feel like family and like we were at home. The doorman, Thomas, was a particularly lovely human being and gave us such great tips and advice. Daily breakfast was special and the staff was very accommodating. We had dinner there one night as well and the food was exceptional. The foie gras in particular was the best I've ever had!
The location is ideal, right next to the Barcelona Cathedral and walkable to main attractions like La Rambla, La Boqueria (the market), and subway is super close to get to other sites. The hotel has a beautiful square that you can have a nice drink in during the evenings and is very quaint. It serves as a school playground during the weekdays so can be a little rowdy, but we didn't mind that.
I would absolutely stay here again and recommend to all my friends and family!",5,2022,05,15
14,Beautiful Hotel and Extraordinary Experience at Hotel Neri,"The hotel is located next to the cathedral of Barcelona in the historic Gothic Quarter. It's great location creates a walkable experience to many attractions. The interior design of the hotel was outstanding. But even better was the absolutely amazing staff that wait on you for everything. They were the kindest and most attentive of our visit to this beautiful city. The very best was the food. Having gone for business with locals, we tried a lot of places, but the locals were asounded at how magnificent the food was a the Hotel. HIGHLY recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,14
14,Highly recommended,My husband and I stayed at Neri as our last stop on a two week vacation through Spain for 5 nights. The location was ideal in the historic gothic center. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had one of the smaller rooms but is very comfortable and enough space to relax in. We enjoyed sitting on the roof top deck after a day of walking the city.   We had a dinner in the restaurant and it was one of our best dinners of the trip. It is in a charming small square. Try the shrimp tacos tapas and the mango dessert. They are out of this world.,5,2022,05,13
14,Anazing Stay at Hotel Neri,"I am leaving Hotel Neri in a few minutes but had to take time to right this review. My friend and I stayed for 3 days before getting on a cruise. From even before we got here the customer service was ANAZING! Ioann Migunov, front desk, arranged a car pick up from the airport and answered ALL of my questions via email. When I got here we were met by Dario who carried our luggage from the square nearby. He was so friendly. The hotel is adorable, clean and in the best location in the Gothic Quarter. We ate breakfast downstairs in the restaurant each morning...incredible! But by far the highlight was our server, Marana. She couldn't be friendlier and more informative. She started off our day with such sunshine we couldn't help being in a good mood all day. We will truly miss the staff at this wonderful hotel.",5,2022,05,13
14,"Perfect location, incredibly staff, luxurious amenities",Stayed at Neri for three nights to cap off a two week vacation through Spain and Portugal. We debating booking this as it was the most expensive stay on the entire trip...but we were so so happy we did. What a treat - the perfect end to a trip. The neighborhood is perfect for aimless strolls at any time of the day or night. The amenities were top notch. And the staff was so helpful and kind. Thomas stole our hearts. Can't wait to come back.,5,2022,05,10
14,Amazing service!!!,"Though the Relais and Chateaux line is renowned for their service, our expectations were exceeded by how each staff member, regardless of role, was kind, professional, and helpful. In particular, Thomas set the tone for welcoming us and was very helpful in giving logistical tips on how to navigate our visit. The concierges went out of their way to answer all our questions. It was very reassuring to have their support as traveling in a foreign city can be a bit overwhelming and stressful. It's a lovely feeling to have such a personalized experience while traveling, and because the hotel is small, you never feel that its crowded (a nice contrast to the streets of Barcelona!). 
We stayed in an apartment in ""Casa Neri"" which is a building across the street with 6 apartment suites. I really wanted to have access to laundry during our stay, and the option of eating in. This building also has a private roof deck with a very small pool (the main hotel also has a roof terrace as well). 
As one previous reviewer has noted, the apartment decor doesn't feel plushy or particularly romantic, but is more modern - the pictures on the website are pretty accurate. The bathroom was on the smaller side (one sink, no tub, walk in shower) and it was by the front door. And I think all the rooms in the Gothic Quarter might feel a little darker because of the nature of the area. But in terms of hotel service, there is no difference, the bed linens were pristinely clean and comfortable, and having the bit of extra space and a washer/dryer, was totally worth it to me. 
Also, as other reviewers have noted, the hotel is tucked away on a pedestrian side street in the Gothic Quarter. It's very centrally located, so once you get your bearings, it's easy access to everything, but it does take a day or so to feel confident navigating the area. If having door to door access by taxi on a regular basis is important to you, then this location would be more challenging - not all the cab drivers know how to get there - its much easier to have them drop you off at one of the main plazas. We asked the hotel to arrange for a taxi to pick us up to take us to Parc Guell, and this was handled with no issue. (Thomas then instructed the driver exactly where to drop us off, which was great since we had a timed entry). 
Lastly, the food at the restaurant was excellent - I would highly recommend getting the breakfast package which is essentially any hot item you want off the menu plus a full breakfast tray (with toast, croissants, fruit, yogurt, granola, juice, milk). We also had the lunch and dinner prix fixe menus on other days, and felt that we sampled most of the menu offerings by the end of our stay. 
Highly recommend, and would choose this hotel again primarily because of our experience with the staff.",5,2022,05,07
14,Neri Apartments,"We chose the Neri based on the excellent reviews, and took one of the apartments, as my husband had to work during our stay. 
We have been to Barcelona many times previously, the hotel is very centrally located, and it is easy to visit all the sights. Although as many have pointed out, it is not easy to reach by taxi if you have heavy luggage or mobility issues. 
Check in was super efficient, and first impressions of the hotel are very favourable. We intended to sit on the terrace for lunch, but the hoards of visitors to the square made it too busy, so we had lunch in the restaurant, which was very good. Close attention has been taken to decor and lighting, the staff are very friendly, and the area is very inviting. We subsequently went for drinks in the bar on several occasions, which we really enjoyed.
In contrast, we were disappointed with the difference from the hotel to the apartments. The building has clearly been renovated recently, and certainly all the functionality taken care of. The dining area provided the additional space we needed, and there was a dishwasher/washing machine/microwave/toaster etc. everything you would want and expect in a modern apartment. Housekeeping for the apartments was excellent, and they even washed up ! However, unfortunately the expected ‘luxury’ in the apartments did not meet our expectations. The floors are all concrete, the bathroom pokey, and the environment missing the thoughtful and historic touches we expected. We did not find the space inviting enough to dine in, and ended up eating every meal out, which had not been our intention. It wouldn’t take much to make this area more luxurious and inviting. The rooftop pool space was pleasant and luckily we had some sunny days and were able to sit out. Overall, I would recommend staying in the hotel itself, but we thought the apartments were expensive in comparison.",4,2022,05,01
14,Hotel Neri!,"Wonderful stay at Hotel Neri!  Special kudos to Marina, Elida, Manil and Thomas.  Excellent staff!  They are truly an asset to the company.  We enjoyed Restaurant A immensely.  Would definitely stay here again if we ever return to Barcelona.",5,2022,04,30
14,Perfect location and great experience,"Absolutely loved this place.   It can be tricky selecting a hotel in a new city but this one exceeded my hopes.  The location was fabulous steps away from the Cathedral but around the corner on a clean and quiet side street so it was peaceful.  The room was larger than I expect for such a historic location.  The bathroom was highly upgraded with towel heater, bidet, and a great shower. The staff was 100% kind and attentive.  There was a great rooftop deck that you could hear the bells ringing at sunset and press a button to have them bring up a cocktail.  The chocolate dessert at the restaurant was amazing and worth a trip even if you didn't stay at the hotel. Highly recommended!",5,2022,04,26
14,World class service in a gorgeous 11th century bldg.,Hotel Neri has to be one of the most enjoyable hotel experiences in my life. The service and attention to detail from every single staff member my wife and I interacted with was phenomenal. We stayed in the apartments and the design/layout was very well throughout. It was nice to have the amenities of kitchen/apartment with the full service of the hotel(room service/housekeeping). The location was both a blessing and a curse. It was very central but getting taxis to/from hotel was a challenge. Also dealing with the hordes of tourists and tour groups gets old as well. But the service and design of this hotel more than make up for it.,5,2022,04,24
14,Amazing hotel,"True luxury and style, great location (don’t expect your taxi to be able to access the narrow street).
Service is fantastic room fully equipped. Bed - Devine. 
Staff very helpful and nice especially Thomas in the front. 
Adjacent to placa Neri which is jam. Perfect location.",5,2022,04,21
14,Perfect first stop in BCN,"I'm so impressed with hotel Neri. This was our first stop in Barcelona and we couldn't have had a better introduction to this amazing city. The hotel staff, particularly Thomas, was so helpful. I've never had staff literally walk with us to the café next-door to help us order and make sure we're all set up. They took hospitality above and beyond. The accommodations were fantastic, we had the option to include breakfast in our stay, daily we decided between going downstairs to the restaurant (sooo cute!) or ordering it to the room. They made the process so easy, left the menu on the door so we could just order by 2 AM and it would be ready for us whatever time we decided in the AM. The biggest plus about this place is the location. You are steps away from the cathedral which makes any hop on/hop off Tour so easy to navigate, also so convenient to just tell cabs to drop you off at the cathedral. Everything is walkable and gorgeous surrounding this hotel that's tucked away between tiny alleys. Highly recommend for those who are looking to just explore the city and be comfortable with their accommodations, I don't think they have a rooftop pool but this wasn't even a concern for us because we were more interested in exploring Barcelona. 

tldr: HIGHLY RECOMMEND! PERFECT LOCATION, walkable, gorgeous, staff is amazing. Will come back.",5,2022,04,12
14,Wonderful 2nd Stay,We first stayed at hotel Neri in 2010 for our 20th wedding anniversary; we returned in 2022 to visit our son studying in Barcelona and to celebrate our 32nd anniversary. The Hotel's location is ideal; its understated elegance and the attention to detail by its gracious staff made our stay exceptional.,5,2022,04,10
14,"Wonderful location, great staff, awesome breakfast","Family city break in Barcelona, stayed in one of the Neri apartments. Great size of room for such a fabulous location and perfect for a family of four (two kids on a comfy sofa bed). Breakfast was fabulous each day and staff so welcoming. Small terrace and pool on top floor of both apartments and hotel would’ve been perfect if the weather had been warmer! Overall, great hotel and wouldn’t hesitate to return!",5,2022,04,04
14,Thomas made our experience first rate,"Thomas made us feel like we had a friend in Barcelona.  He ran to help us get a taxi on a busy Sunday.  He greeted us warmly whenever we walked by.    The hotel was great.  You need to know that you can't pull up in a car, but need to walk 5 minutes to the road.  But we knew that and loved the location.",5,2022,04,02
14,NERI - Gothic & Wonderful,"Staying in the Gothic Section of Barcelona is fun... and the Hotel NERI is in an amazing location - just off the Cathedral Plaza.  From the hotel you can walk to amazing historic, sites, restaurants, shops and more!  But what makes the Hotel Neri a 5-star hotel is the staff.  To a person, they will greet you like an old friend... and try and help make your stay great!  From the front desk, to the bellman (Tomas), to the waitresses and bartenders... everyone you encounter is dedicated to making you feel welcome and offers whatever help they can!  More than anything else, the staff is what makes this hotel so special and deserving of a 5-star ratimg!",5,2022,03,27
14,Great Hotel and Staff,We had a group of six of us using three rooms.  Some of us arrived at different times from the US and the hotel allowed our adult son to check in early as he was the first to arrive.  The staff was very attentive and assisted us in obtaining our required covid test before returning to the USA.  The hotel is fairly small and very quant. The rooms were spacious and very clean.  The breakfast was huge and very good.  Our server was excellent and joked around with us which was a lot of fun.   Anas our bartender made some very unique and very good drinks at the bar.  He explained how he makes each drink which was very interesting.  We popped into the bar twice and each night he made something different for us.  Really enjoyed talking with him and the other folks sitting at the bar.  All three groups checked out at different time and the desk had everything organized well.  Would recommend to anyone to stay at the Neri.,5,2022,03,26
14,Perfection!,"We often seek R&C properties when we travel, which is how we discovered Hotel Neri. From check in to check out, the entire staff (front desk/concierge, restaurant, housekeeping and Thomas) were both extraordinarily helpful and friendly. The hotel provides a space that is classic and modern at the same time while also managing to be incredibly relaxing. The rooms are well appointed (including the most comfortable bed you'll ever sleep in). Tucked away on a quiet street in the Gothic Quarter, you're in an amazing location without any noise. We will definitely stay there again!",5,2022,03,23
14,Jewel in the Gothic Quarter,"Perfect blend of historic building with modern amenities. Rooms were well appointed. The two key hotel room factors - shower and bed - exceeded my expectations. Our daughters loved the outdoor bath/shower on our deck. I believe these are only on the top floor rooms. Service was excellent, particularly Thomas who acted like the mayor of Barcelona. Note that it is difficult to get cars to the hotel due to the narrow streets so the hotel will send somebody to help you with bags from the main streets by the cathedral.",5,2022,03,23
14,Lunch in the hotel's restaurant,"Excellent location near the Cathedral. Very good lunch with dishes to share.
Reasonably priced for a Relais et Château. Cosy modern interior in medieval building.
Friendly service in English.
Not able to judge the rooms as we just had a meal in the restaurant",5,2022,03,21
14,The Best.,"Hotel Neri is one of those great treasures you feel lucky to find. Everything was impeccable and welcoming. From the rooms to the staff to the food to the location, this is one of the best hotels I’ve ever encountered, and I cannot wait to return. Thomas gave some great insights on where to explore and was so hospitable. It is, in summary, the best.",5,2022,03,05
14,The best of the best!,"Absolutely unbelievable property. Super comfortable rooms, top-notch service, great breakfast served in the room (what a personal touch!), the best in room slippers I have ever seen .. I can go on and on. They simply don't put a foot wrong. 

If in Barcelona stay here and nowhere else.",5,2022,02,20
14,Lovely Stay!,"We were thrilled with our 3 night stay at the Hotel Neri in early October.  The location, size, room cleanliness, restaurant, staff were all exceptional. We were a little nervous to travel during the pandemic, but always felt very safe. The breakfast service was outstanding! We also ending up eating dinner at the hotel two of our three nights in Barcelona because not only was the food very good, but we enjoyed sitting on the outside courtyard in an uncrowded setting.  We walked all over the city from this excellent location in the Gothic Quarter. Shoutout to Thomas, the bellman, who was always so warm, welcoming and helpful. Good value for the money. Booked through Amex Platinum and received some nice perks.",5,2022,02,07
14,Just perfect !,"Fantastic stay ! Great location! 
We stayed here for 2 nights . From start to finish all in all it was a really pleasant stay . Staff go above and beyond . Thomas , Taulan and Ioann looked after us entire stay . Nothing was too much trouble . Our room was really nice , with super comfy bed and with everything you need from tea , coffee and water . 
We slept really well on both nights and a choice of breakfast was brilliant ! 
We would Definitely stay here again due to location and how comfy it was ! 
Well done to all and thank you for a lovely mini-break !",5,2022,02,07
14,Amazing boutique hotel in gothic quarter,"From the minute we walked in my daughter and I were greeted with the utmost attention.  We were upgraded due to Amex platinum and the room was amazing.  Bed was super comfortable bathroom amazing.  Also had a terrace. The most amazing staff you can imagine.  The front desk, the restaurant, the bar. In all aspects of hotel. Would definitely come back.",5,2022,01,14
14,Great,"Excellent hotel in a gorgeous neighborhood.
Lovely bedroom, very calm and clean.
The team was great and really helping.
Thomas was incredible and managed all our transfers (airport, Sagrada Familia, parl Guell...).
We loved the restaurant.
We will come back
",5,2021,12,29
14,Exceeded our expectations!,"From the great location to the lovely rooms , friendly helpful staff to the delicious food and great wine selection , Hotel Neri exceeded all of our expectations!  We were traveling with two other couples. Some of us had visited Barcelona many years ago and some had never been to this beautiful city. We all just loved the cleanliness,friendliness, diverse architecture and great sense of history we discovered in this Gothic section of Barcelona. All the staff were great but Thomas was especially helpful! We very much appreciated our spacious room with immaculate linens, comfy bed and luxurious spa tub with separate rainfall shower.",5,2021,11,28
14,A perfect place to introduce yourself to the Barcelona Barrio Gothica,"The Hotel Neri in Barcelona is where my wife and I stayed for three nights to start our first, post-pandemic trip. It was a great choice. From the moment we walked into the lobby door we felt special and everyone there did their best to ensure we kept feeling that way during our entire stay.

The Hotel Neri has, what I guess are normal hotel rooms, but we stayed in one of their apartments. It was quite spacious and had everything we would want in an extended stay.

We booked our stay with our Amex Platinum card, through Amex, and had a $100 credit. We used this the first night at their restaurant. We tried several of their tapas and loved a local pork topped focaccia dish. It was one of the tastiest dishes we had on our entire trip (see pic).

Breakfast at the Neri is also wonderful. They start out by bringing a tray filled with yogurt, croissants, toast, juice, coffee, fresh fruit and probably more I don’t recall (see pic). Then, if you are still hungry you can order eggs, avocado toast, a Spanish omelette or quite a few other dishes.

The ‘street’ outside the Neri is too small for taxis so you do have to walk their from the plaza but it is only a 2-3 minute walk and we did not find it an issue. It is also 2 minutes to the front of the cathedral where there is both a taxi stand and a stop for the hop-on-off bus.

I highly recommend Hotel Neri.",5,2021,11,25
14,AMAZING EXPERIENCE!,"We went for nice dinner last night with my girlfriend(we have been in many of best restaurants in world) We didnt have any expectations, only had some friends told us the restaurante was very nice.
So we got in and all an experience!
Sr Anas ( I hope i write good his name) made us have on of our best food and drink experience in Barcelona.
He took us to the bar with their amazing bartender and gave us to try new flavours and just made us feel what we needed to start the journey.
After those amazing cocktails they took us to our table and explained their menu ( very fancy menu). Spoke to us to know what were we looking for to continue the experience and he made it ! :)
I 100% RECOMEND MAKE TRUST OF THIS GUY, HE WILL MAKE YOU ENJOY ANYWAY! 

They made us so happy we even made reservation for 1 night in their Hotel. 
I will text tomorow how was this end of our jorney in hotel.",5,2021,11,16
14,Just book and enjoy!,From the first second at the start until the last second Hotel Neri did everything to comfort our stay. Their bar/restaurant has a wonderful team which made us happy at breakfast (very good) lunch and diner. The location is great and we loved de architecture of the hotel. Just book and enjoy 😉,5,2021,11,13
14,"Excellent location, nice rooms, but terrible front desk/concierge","This is a lovely boutique hotel in a great location - right near the cathedral. (Caveat: You will probably have to walk the last few blocks from your cab.)

Rooms are pleasant as are the bathroom. 

The interior and lobby are chic.

HOWEVER, the front desk and concierge were terrible. They couldn't answer basic questions or do simple tasks.

e.g. 

How do we get to the cable car for Montjuïc? Suggested a station that is no longer open.

When is the dancing fountain show? No answer - the show is temporarily suspended because of COVID.

Obviously COVID is a factor in all service these days, but these are basic questions for the most common attractions.

I wanted to book a train. The front desk was ready to book a fare 3x what the best fare was. I don't speak Catalan or Spanish and was able to figure out that something looked off. 

The woman working breakfast was great.",3,2021,11,08
14,Special and unique,"We stayed at one of the Hotel Neri apartments, which meant we had the luxury of having two rooms for our family of four, a dining table, kitchenette and lounge area, but also the use of the hotel amenities. The decor was modern but in a beautiful gothic building with the stone walls and  high ceilings. It was also very clean and felt COVID safe, which is so important now. The location was amazing and we visited most attractions on foot, even with our young children. 

The staff were very friendly, welcoming and accommodating. Every morning breakfast was served with big smiles and the same attentiveness. The tray and cooked breakfast selection was great. 

A special mention to Mauro, on Reception, who was very patient and helpful in booking our day excursion to Montserrat and despite being very busy, never rushed us or failed to make us feel like special guests. He also recommended the best seafood we ate in Barcelona at Can Fisher! 

Thomas was also really kind, carrying our bags to our taxi to the airport, in very heavy rain. Nothing was too much for him! 

We had an incredible holiday in Barcelona and our stay at this special and unique hotel played a huge part in that. Thank you so much!",5,2021,11,01
14,Excellent location!,"Superb location that cannot be beat. Excellent and beautiful buildout Had continuing electrical problem in room. In one case power was out for several hours due circuit breaker tripping. Request for room credit refused. Also, bathtub very slippery when taking shower, be careful!",3,2021,11,01
14,"Beautiful, tranquil, best location!","We spent 3 nights here last week and it was such a lovely stay.  Just walking in you get a sense of tranquility and calm with the décor and all the lit candles.  The staff could not be more attentive--helpful with all inquiries, arrangements and questions.   Every detail is tended to, the rooms and bathrooms are beautiful, and the food in the restaurant is also topnotch.   Breakfast tray is a sight to behold:-).   Bonus: located right in the middle of the Gothic quarter, walkable to everything, but yet very quiet.   Will definitely return.  Thank you, staff at Hotel Neri for an unforgettable stay!",5,2021,10,26
14,Just the most perfect stay,A friend and I came to Barcelona for a week to celebrate our big birthdays and Neri was the perfect place. The location is spectacular. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel itself is gorgeous including the peaceful little plaza in the back where you can enjoy a drink or dinner in the lovely restaurant. I can’t imagine staying anywhere else. Just an amazing experience. Don’t miss out on the roof deck for a drink or a cup of coffee,5,2021,10,10
14,Tiny Oasis,"We stayed here for 4 nights, and very much appreciated this hidden gem.  The staff were all super friendly and welcoming, the drinks were tasty, dinner and breakfast were perfect, but the sleep . . . ah, the sleep!  Ultimately, that's the primary reason you choose a hotel.  The bed and linens were top notch, but even better, for jet-lagged travelers, those thick palace walls coupled with modern windows and heavy curtains meant we were able to sleep for over 10 hours.  What luxury!",5,2021,10,06
14,"Stylish Hotel, Charming Staff, Excellent Location","I’ve been fortunate to visit Barcelona on many occasions staying in various areas, finding this stylish, well appointed hotel in the Gothic was the most perfect choice I made for our entire trip throughout Spain. For any foreigner visiting another country, even with command of the language, the help of the staff can entirely make or break your experience. In our case we needed to arrive a day earlier after a not so lovely experience at another hotel, and the hotel staff immediately made accommodations for us, arrangements for our car and dinner reservations on a late arrival. It was so pleasant to arrive to a beautifully appointed apartment, in the most charming and romantic area of all Barcelona. The next morning Thomas, who we absolutely adored, arranged to move all of our luggage and assist us in many ways after being upgraded to a truly lovely room in the main hotel. The space is well designed, and would please every aesthetic, thoughtful planning of the lighting makes everyone beautiful! Breakfast daily is wonderful, we dined the first morning in the restaurant and chose to dine for breakfast in room the rest of our stay. It’s no surprise this hotel is awarded the standard of Relais Chateau, it’s a beautiful property, and it is expertly managed.
Why Stay Here?
Location, Location, Location, stunning architecture abounds and surrounds, close to the beach, excellent dining, chic small shops, local artisans, and some of the more popular sites.
Quiet and elegant

14,Perfect stay for our honeymoon!,"This hotel was everything we expected and so much more! Great location, beautiful facilities and 5 star service. The staff was very welcoming, offered great recommendations and made us feel at home.  They upgraded us to a suite and sent us sweets and champagne to celebrate our honeymoon.  The rooms are beautiful with high ceilings and everything you could possibly need. The restaurant staff was very friendly (make sure you book room with breakfast as it can get expensive). We loved the back terrace for a drink and dessert after exploring the city or the rooftop.  The outside may seem a little sketchy but it's very safe plus they have 24/7 security.  Overall a wonderful stay!  A big thank you to the hotel and the wonderful staff.  We will definitely  return.",5,2021,10,04
14,Lovely Boutique Hotel.,"For our first honeymoon night we choose this lovely hotel in the barrio Gotik. Luigi at the Concierge had lots of ideas for out dinners.
Rooms on the street are very close to the next building but the small plaza behind the hotel, just in front of the restaurant is a secret for Bcn.
Will remember Thomas at the concierge for his simpaty and customer feeling.
Robert and Cecilia",4,2021,10,04
14,Best Place to stay in Barcelona,"Great location, beautiful facility and unbelievable staff. We were traveling as a family of ten, one of those being a 2 year old. The rooms are well equipped, beautifully finished, clean and comfortable. A beautiful outdoor dining area where we enjoyed our breakfast every morning. ",5,2021,10,01
14,The most incredible hotel experience I could have ever asked for!,"I can not recommend Hotel Neri enough! It was the first hotel we stayed at in Spain and was the perfect start to our trip! The staff was incredible from the minute we arrived. Thomas was quick to help us and was so great to chat with through the duration of our stay. You could tell how passionate he was about his job and was always a joy to be around. Luigi was also incredible with helping us find places to eat and explore - truly the whole staff was incredible. They also had a delish restaurant and bar on site and we throughly enjoyed every meal we had. The hotel is also very private so it was never crowded and the whole staff was very cautious with wearing masks and keeping things clean. They also cleaned rooms twice a day and the AC was incredible in the room, which was nice after a long day. All and all, you should totally stay at this hotel! It's in a central location, rooms are amazing and the staff will make your trip that much better! Also, one last note. They have incredible shampoo & conditioner in the bathrooms. A lot of hotels (even nice ones) miss the mark on this and Hotel Neri really delivered. Can't wait to visit again!",5,2021,09,20
14,"Nice hotel, spectacular service!","The Hotel Neri, down a tiny, beautiful side street but on a ""main"" historical plaza, really is a gem.  Yes of course, the room was nice, lovely even.  My terrace room had an outdoor shower, too! But all my praise goes to the service provided, which was simply incomparable! It began with Thomas at the door - he saw our taxi could not negotiate the tight turn so he raced down the street to assist and carried two VERY heavy bags inside and upstairs. ALWAYS with a warm and genuine smile to greet or wish you well, he is a tremendous credit to the hotel and exudes both warmth and honest care of each guest.
Then we come to Luigi at the front desk - I've been in a thousand hotels in my life, all around the world and Luigi has topped every front desk anywhere! He was not only warm and welcoming, but SMART, diverse in his knowledge, not just of the hotel or the surroundings with recommendations, but many, many other conversational topics, especially ones most personal to me.  I wish had time for a meal or even a coffee to talk to this man more, he was that engaging and articulate on any number of global topics. Helpful, supportive, multilingual, kind, generous with his time and honest opinion, he is a true credit to the hotel!",5,2021,09,10
14,Can’t wait to stay here again,"We LOVE this hotel.  It is in a fantastic location.  Easy walking distance to restaurants, sites, shopping.  Amazing service all around.  The room was lovely. A huge thank you to Luigi - great restaurant recommendations!  We are definitely staying here on our next visit.",5,2021,09,09
14,Boutique Gem in Barcelona,"I discovered this hidden gem quite by accident—and what a happy accident it was!  From the moment I walked in, the staff was warm, friendly, helpful and accommodating.  The restaurant is comfortable and has a phenomenal bartender who cranks out some of the best craft cocktails I’ve had in Spain (I’ve always found cocktails hit or miss in Spain, so finding great ones is noteworthy!).  The room is beautifully appointed, incredibly comfortable, all-new and well-laid out.  My particular room has not one but TWO bathtubs, one of which is on a private terrace outside.  As a constant traveler, little details matter to me, so the use of Molton Brown products is a win.  But even better, the fact that they’re in beautiful refillable branded pottery, rather than disposable plastic is a wonderful touch.  The front desk was consistently fantastic, helping with everything from booking the best tapas I’ve had in years to booking an in-hotel COVID test for me.  I like to have one key hotel in each city I travel to around the world—and I’ve now found my home hotel in Barcelona!",5,2021,09,07
14,what a wonderful stay in a quiet area of the Barcelona Gothic Quarter,"I had an amazing three night stay at Hotel Neri and the service and hotel room made my trip to Barcelona all the better.

The hotel is located on a quiet pedestrian street in the Gothic Quarter in one of the most charming and hidden squares called Plaça de Sant Felip Neri. It is just steps away from the Barcelona Cathedral. Everything in the vicinity is walkable and charming - amazing restaurants and sightseeing closeby. Las Ramblas is close, as is the Liceu metro stop.

My room was comfortable as well, after a day of walking and sightseeing. The bed was extremely comfortable, bathroom was spacious, as was the terrace with the outdoor bathtub. I definitely made use of the outdoor bathtub during the afternoon Siesta hours.

Breakfast was top notch, especially the smorgasbord of foods from the ""Neri Tray"" which was a sampler of breakfast items. The other breakfast items were also very good.

A Restaurant, which is where breakfast is served, also serves lunch and dinner. They have outdoor dining in the quiet Square, which was wonderful. The food was mediocre for lunch and dinner though.",5,2021,09,04
14,Small but perfectly formed,"Hotel Neri is a charming small hotel in the old City.  We stayed in the Casa Neri, which are the few apartments a few doors down from the main hotel.  This had the advantage of more space and facilities with a lounge, dining area/kitchenette, but also full access to the hotel.  Everything about the hotel is small and the more charming for it, including the roof top pool.  Breakfasts in the small square behind the hotel were adorable.",5,2021,08,24
14,Gracious Property in the Heart of Barcelona’s Old City,"We were incredibly comfortable at Hotel Neri. The staff were friendly and helpful, and we had all our needs met, including an in room COVID test and a 3 AM airport taxi. The room was beautifully appointed, though with a delightfully subtle style—it was not ostentatious. The bed was the most comfortable of our stay in Spain. We would highly recommend this property. ",5,2021,08,13
14,Amazing hotel,"We have just returned from 3 nights celebrating my 50th Birthday. Wonderful experience from start to finish, the staff couldn't do enough for us. Drinks on arrival, then drinks on the roof terrace with cake. 
Rooms are gorgeous and very clean.
The cocktails were fabulous as was dinner in the restaurant. We all had a truly amazing time.",5,2021,08,10
14,Fun stay with kids in the Elegant Gothic Quarter,"We had a lovely stay at Hotel Neri this past week.  We are traveling with 2 kids (age 6 & 9), they absolutely loved it.  The pool was always very subdued, my 2 got to have fun in it all alone.  The breakfast and dessert were particular hits!  Order the french toast!  We want to give a special thank you to the doorman Thomas.  He was kind and immensely helpful.",5,2021,08,09
14,Gateway to Barcelona for a short stay,The staff is helpful! Thomas was very nice and spoke German as well as English. The only problem we had is closed restaurant so you only get half of experience. Location is very central. Helped with booking for tests and Excursions. The rooms are clean. The pool on the roof is small and only for the kids to cool down but it brings nice atmosphere to the lounge area. Barmen were all very nice. Breakfast was perfect!,4,2021,07,23
14,Amazing study in Barcelona ,"We have stayed in Barcelona several times and Hotel Neri is by far the best place we have stayed.  The staff are amazing.  Our whole stay was just the best,  the location of the hotel is perfect and the room and bed were so comfortable.  I can't say enough about Hotel Neri!",5,2021,07,20
14,"Great staff, awesome hotel in the middle of history","Rooms were spacious and clean and service was incredible. The entire staff was friendly and responsive, special thanks to Eduardo for the Porto recommendations! 
Also close to some really good restaurants, we loved albocar.",5,2021,07,17
14,Well situated hotel that was within walking distance to many sites/restaurants/shopping.,Uniquely constructed boutique hotel-restored a 12th century building into a true five star hotel.  Lobby and rooms were well appointed.  The concierge service was second to none and attended to our every need.  Took care of many of our restaurant reservations and taxi needs.  They also arranged for our covid tests before we left.  Staff could not be more friendly and nice.  Love this hotel and would stay there again on a return trip.  Highly recommend.,5,2021,07,13
14,Hotel with the old world charm,"This hotel is in the old town of Barcelona, and it’s the old word charm. We were amazed by the level of service, atmosphere, food and location. Food and location were simply amazing. The breakfast is simple every day, simply but delicious. If I go back to Barcelona, I will definitely stay here.",5,2020,04,14
14,Quaint hotel in the heart of the Gotic Quarter,"We enjoyed our time at Hotel Neri. People were very courteous, professional, helpful, and customer oriented.
Access with taxi or private car to the entrance of the hotel is not always possible and you may need to walk a couple of blocks to/from the parliament square. However the hotel staff will help you with your luggage in that case.  
We will return to Hotel Neri once the construction to the Sagrada Familia Basilica is completed in 2026. :)",5,2020,03,17
14,Sophisticated hotel at a great location,Excellent rooms with high quality sheets (great attention to detail). Staff was helpful and professional. Location ideal. Breakfast was excellent with quality entrees as well as good breads and yogurt.,5,2020,03,09

14,A wonderful and uniquely lovely small hotel,"My daughter and I loved our stay at Hotel Neri.  It's a gem of a hotel with a beautiful, earthy, artsy, and very tranquil atmosphere.  The staff is attentive and helpful.  The room was well appointed and very comfortable. The restaurant serves inventive, fresh, and delicious food.  Breakfast was absolute perfection.",5,2020,03,03
14,Nice week-end in Barcelona Gotic Quarter,"Very well situated Hotel in the historic quarter of Gotic, close to the Cathedral and Ramblas. Nice historic building and decoration with modern style. Recommend for people who want to be in the very center. A bit noisily at night, but ok in the mornings. ",5,2020,03,02
14,Outstanding luxury boutique hotel in historic gothic quarter,"This hotel is a gem. It is in combined 12th and 18th century houses in the Gothic Quarter, and the onsite bar & restaurant look out onto the lovely Placa de Sant Felip Neri. The hotel staff are exceptional - they are gracious, helpful, welcoming and everything you hope for out of your hospitality team. They took care of every request, from the airport transportation to unique architectural tours (I am an architect). The room we stayed in (Neri Suite) was spacious, quiet, comfortable, lovely, well appointed. Our bathroom was beautiful and spa-like. The small touches like the hand written welcome note and sweets in our room at check-in, the ever-present chilled still or sparking water and cava in the hotel lobby to quench a weary travelers thist, the scented candles burning every evening to add romantic ambiance and aroma, the amazing cappuccinos at every breakfast, the DELICIOUS breakfast included in your stay (if you book on their site directly it is included, and you WANT the breakfast - it is the best thing ever), the entire amazing menu at onsite 'a restaurant', the turndown service every night, the big comfy bed and down pillows, the birthday cake in our room on my birthday! - every single detail was well thought out and exceeded our expectations. I travel at least 50% of the year for work and we take at least 1-2 international vacations/year. I can't remember a better hotel experience that we have ever had. If you're traveling to Barcelona and you want the hotel to be one of the best parts of your trip, then I can't recommend Hotel Neri highly enough. I would travel back to Barcelona just to stay here again!",5,2020,02,24
14,Delightful oasis with great customer service,"Happy staff, historic building, refurbishment of the roof terrace was taking place in January so they moved us to a quieter nearby hotel. It will be great no doubt. Easy to access the historic sites. Staff were friendly and professional, nothing was too much trouble. Will come back to stay becuase our deluxe room looked well appointed.

14,Wonderful hotel,"This lovely boutique hotel in the heart of the gothic quarter is a gem. The rooms are beautiful, the service impeccable and the location puts you in the heart of the old city with atmosphere and history everywhere you look. Breakfast just amazing! We had our whole family (10 of us including three children under 3) staying there so somewhat challenging guest group -- and everyone could not have been nicer. We had two rooms and an apartment in a nearby building -- both rooms and apartment were spacious and comfortable. The concierge service to make it so we could take such a large party out for dinner every night could not have been more helpful. This is the place to stay in Barcelona!",5,2020,01,31
14,Hotel Neri - excellent,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Neri as recommended by friends.  We highly recommend it.  Everything from the room, the restaurant/bar and lobby area, and the staff were excellent. Everyone was professional and went out of their ways to make our stay at the hotel and in Barcelona enjoyable.",5,2020,01,09
14,Xmas in Barcelona,"Hidden gem in the old Town, close to many Barcelona attractions  and shopping galore.
Yet tranquil, beautiful hotel with attentive friendly staff in historic building, excellent service.
Amidst the crowds of Xmas shoppers and hordes of tourists it is a relaxing place to stay.",5,2019,12,29
14,"Great property, great location!","Hotel Neri is in a fantastic location! We were greated with reception Kava, which the ladies on our team enjoyed!! The Hotel amenities are beautiful and the staff is truly a pleasure to work with! We only had one night but we made the most of it by walking to the nearby Gothic area, enjoying tapa's, Kava and wine, and taking is some shopping for the ladies!
It was such a beautiful experience to wake up to the children from the nearby school as well!! Great experience, great location, and great service, we could not have asked for more!",5,2019,12,04
14,Beautiful hotel and superb staff.,"Whilst the building, room, ambience and location of Hotel Neri were all really excellent, it was the staff and the quality of service which was outstanding. They were all, without exception, warm, attentive and concerned to ensure we had everything we could need. ",5,2019,11,26
14,I hardly recommend,"We spent a week-end at Hotel Neri and the experience was fabulous, starting from the welcome until the end of the journey. The atmosphere is sophisticated, the service impeccable, the surround lovely. Our bedroom was really comfortable and the night we decided to take an appetizer inside the hotel has been perfect. i hardly recommend the Relais & Chateaux Neri and will definitly choose it once again when returning to Barcelona! Thank you Veronica for your assistance!",5,2019,11,25
14,Amazing experience,"I had organized a weekend in Barcelona to celebrate my husband's birthday with a group of close friends.
I had previously heard of this hotel, but the quality of our stay massively exceeded my expectations.
It is a true jewel in the center of the gothic area of the city. Beautiful, charming, clean, elegant, truly amazing from all points of view. 
The personnel was outstandingly professional and well-mannered. 
I have no words to describe the commitment, passion and availability which Veronica Mansson, the sales manager at the hotel, had in my regards during all the time we spent organizing together this wonderful event. 
No ""thank you"" will ever be enough to fully express how grateful I am for her help.
I recommend with all my heart this astonishing place which will forever stay among my dearest memories.

14,A touch of class located in the past!,"As you wind your way through the old Jewish Call section of the Gothic quarter, here you will find a boutique hotel that provides the highest quality of stay. This beautiful property is steps away from a historic site of civil war remembrance next to the local school and the Barcelona Cathedral. You will be able to hear the church bells mark the hours. Hotel Neri has two adjacent properties: the hotel proper and apartment hotels just steps away. My husband conducts study abroad programs for university students. The students stayed in the apartments where they had the ability to shop and cook locally which provided them a full cultural experience. We stayed in the hotel and the rooms, service, food and drinks were phenomenal. We cannot recommend Hotel Neri highly enough. They were kind, helpful, and attentive throughout our stay.",5,2019,11,16
14,Beautifully Appointed Hotel in the Heart of the Gothic Quarter,"Every year, for the past 12 years, I have directed a travel program through Europe.  It is always a pleasure to go to Barcelona, but until now, I have not found a hotel that offers wonderful rooms, good service, and exceptional value.  Thankfully, this year we stayed at the Hotel Neri.  It is excellent and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Barcelona.  Located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter with views of the Cathedral, the Hotel is elegant with a kind staff and beautifully appointed rooms.  They even have gorgeous and extremely large apartments with a rooftop pool.  An exquisite hotel, not to be missed!",5,2019,11,16
14,Perfect stay in Barcelona,"We just loved the Hotel Neri. In the most perfect location right in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Was able to walk everywhere from Las Ramblas to the Sagrada Familia.  Beautiful quaint, boutique hotel. The breakfast is to die for. Cannot wait to return. ",5,2019,11,13
14,I would stay here again in a heart beat,The customer service is 5 stars. They spoiled my wife and she now has new expectations when we travel.  We were celebrating my wife’s 50th birthday and they surprised us with champagne and chocolate cake when we came back from visiting the cathedral which is about a 3 minute walk. The room was spacious and very clean. I wish I would have booked another couple of nights. ,5,2019,11,13
14,Pure Spain,"Tucked onto a small side street right near the Cathedral is a perfect boutique hotel.  The room was spacious and well appointed.  The staff were helpful in getting cabs, reservations and directions.  The breakfast was outstanding with both a buffet and menu.  We had tapas one afternoon and dinner one night.",5,2019,11,12
14,Awesome expericence,"I love every aspect of the hotel. From the service to the location, every detail shows the hotel is 100% perfect! I would recommend everyone who will come to Barcelona to live  in Hotel Neri & Chateaux!",5,2019,11,10
14,Small boutique hotel in prime location.,"Gorgeous interior,- a 12 th century palace.  bountiful free breakfast and wonderful hotel staff. We were steps from the cathedral, and enjoyed the residential aspect of the location.  Note the property is in the Gothic  quarter on narrow path.  Taxi access is limited to a few 100 feet from front door. They provided transport to airport. 
",4,2019,11,09
14,Stay,"We were very happy with our stay! Just a small disappointment with the restaurant. The food is served in certain hours, otherwise there is very small choice and no possibility to get even a simple salad. I understand that it’s a probably Spanish culture. But it’s bit uncomfortable for guests from other countries especially with a jet lag:). Otherwise everything is great 👍!!!! ",5,2019,11,04
14,Amazing hotel in the heart of Old Barcelona,"Everything was top notch during my stay at Hotel Neri. From check in, to the beautiful room, to daily delicious breakfast, to concierge recommendations for restaurants in the area. I highly recommend Hotel Neri. ",5,2019,11,02
14,Perfect,"Incredible location, room and staff. Very helpful to orienting you to the city sights and restaurants. We had the Neri Suite which offered a lot of room and amenities. Very quiet part of town, great courtyard for a beer or morning coffee.",5,2019,10,28
14,modern boutique hotel set in gothic architecture,"This was our first stop in Spain and it made a very favorable impression! Having only 22 rooms, we felt as if it was our own personal hotel. It had a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We loved being able to step right out the door into the ancient cobble stoned streets for our walks in the Gothic area.",5,2019,10,27
14,Great boutique hotel,"We loved our stay at the Neri.  Staff were wonderful, charming and attentive. 
The breakfast at the hotel is delicious; the room was beautifully designed, with quality linens and products. 
Our only slight disappointment was that the room was very dark with little sunlight due to the hotel being right in the middle of the gothic quarter; we realise this is not the fault of the staff or hotel. 
The roof terrace on the other hand is in the sunshine all day long. 
Would recommend as a great central base for Barcelona. ",5,2019,10,27
14,Lots of charm in a great location,"What a great place!  I walked past this hotel several times when I was last in Barcelona, and remember thinking, “wouldn’t that be nice?”  I was right!  A very cool, atmospheric hotel where you don’t have to compromise comfort for character. Right next to the Gothic cathedral, and within an easy half hour walk of all the major sites except Parc Guell (still walkable, but more of a hike), but on a quiet street. What could be better?  The room wasn’t huge, but the 14-foot ceilings (!) made it feel spacious, and the minimalist decor kept if feeling very serene.  Extremely helpful staff made reservations a breeze, and were very nice about steering us around the current political protests, which had been a concern. They were great!",4,2019,10,25
14,Fabulous Hotel in Barcelona,"We had a delightful time at Hotel Neri. This adorable boutique hotel is in the perfect location in the city. The concierge and staff there are the best. They go out of their way to make your time in Barcelona wonderful. We have never experienced a more personable, caring staff at a hotel. The accommodations were great and the breakfasts were delicious. Everything about Hotel Neri made our vacation in Barcelona incredible. We will definitely be back to Barcelona and will always stay at Hotel Neri. ",5,2019,10,21
14,Great place to stay,We had a great stay here. The staff were very professional and helpful. The location of the hotel is perfect for really experiencing the historic streets and buildings. The restaurants are plentiful with lots to choose from. We had a comfortable and enjoyable stay. ,5,2019,10,21
14,Great stay,Lovely hotel in an ideal location in the historic center.  The ambiance was wonderful.  Excellent staff.  Loved our suite. Breakfasts are extraordinary.  Lots of wonderful restaurants just a short walk from the hotel.  The only criticism would be the rooftop terrace...no view and hard to get service.,5,2019,10,21
14,My stay at the Neri Hotel Barcelona,"I loved my stay at this charming hotel in the gothic section of Barcelona. Great location, staff was excellent. Offered helpful sightseeing and restaurant suggestions. Breakfast service was excellent.",5,2019,10,21
14,Great location and excellent friendly staff,Very nice hotel. One of the best beds on our 30 day trip to Europe. Staff are so helpful and friendly and all speak English. A real plus for English only speaking guests. There are at least 10 major sites that are within 5-10 minute walking distance from this hotel. Le Cathedral is right outside your door. The Barcelona market is less than 5 minutes. The Picasso Museum is about 8 minutes. The only thing you will need a taxi for is getting from the airport to your hotel ( 25-30 minute ride) or if you want to hit the beach for the day. The Beach is about a 10-15 minute cab ride. Over 30 minutes to walk. 30 restaurants within 10 minute walk from the Hotel door. I would recommend this hotel and will stay here again if we return to Barcelona.,5,2019,10,17
14,Barcelona delight,"Everything about Hotel Neri was fantastic we have traveled around the world and Hotel Neri was one of the best boutique hotel experiences. Great staff, wonderful ambience, great rooms and terrific location. Staff gave us great restaurant recommendations. It is a little hard to access the hotel by car. You have to walk your bags down a narrow walk for a block or so but that small inconvenience is worth it. ",5,2019,10,17
14,Charming,"Hotel Neri is a relaxing oasis from all the energy of Barcelona.  First stayed here 2016.  Returned with my husband and we were able to have same room.  From check in to departure, couldn't have asked for better accommodations and service and food!  Front Desk Manager,Alvaro Gutzman, could run any hotel today!",5,2019,10,16
14,A stay too short,"The Neri is a wonderful hotel in a special location. The hospitality was warm and welcoming. The staff indulged our long stay in the dining room as we relaxed after several days of hiking.  The food was exceptional! Moltes gracies
",5,2019,10,15
14,A great stay!,"We booked this hotel due to its very central location and its reputation. We weren't disappointed.  The doorman was lovely and always smiling and welcoming, the reception staff helpful and approachable and our room, whilst small, was perfectly formed, spotlessly clean and with clever storage.(A sheer curtain would have been nice for privacy from the building oppisite). The molten brown products were a nice touch and we loved the bathroom.  The breakfasts were amazing and beautifully served - the first half on a lovely tray and the second half being cooked to order. The bar area was small and not too atmospheric, although we enjoyed drinks there each evening before retiring. The reception staff were very helpful in keeping us updated regarding the possible demonstrations due following the catalan independence verdicts. We would definitely be back!",5,2019,10,14
14,"Beautiful, Relaxing, Terrific Service","Hotel Neri was completely beautiful a miix of historic and funky.  Extremely comfortable, especially sheets, pillows and beds.  We could walk everywhere from our location and the staff were very good at giving detailed directions.  The restaurant dining was delicious.  Breakfast was hearty with a starter of toast, pastries, fruit, yogurt, nuts, fresh squeezed orange juice.  If you were still hungry, you can order from the menu, eggs, omelets, and the best French toast we have ever had.  For dinner one night they recommended the tomato salad, which included tomato ice cream.  I wasn't sure about that and now I want more.  It was delicious, crisp and fresh.  Hotel Neri looks out over a historic courtyard where tourists roam, children play and a lone guitar player sings.  We loved relaxing there.  The roof is another great place to chill.  Omar at the restaurant, Lara at the front desk and Thomas at the door were some of the many wonderful, warm staff.  Lovely hotel.",5,2019,10,09
14,A very happy week in Barcelona.,"A beautiful hotel, fabulous interior design tucked away in the atmospheric old part of Barcelona. Our spacious room overlooked the prettiest of squares. We loved it. Happy friendly and helpful staff. We really enjoyed getting lost in the many narrow streets and finding tiny bars and restaurants close to the hotel.",5,2019,10,05
14,Hotel Neri in September,"This is a wonderful hotel - a charming old building with parts dating back to the 12th century, but with a beautifully restored interior. Excellent location in the middle of the Gothic Quarter, in the heart of old Barcelona. Service was exceptional, especially concierge recommendations and advice.",5,2019,10,04
14,A piece of history,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her Hotel Neri. The service and staff were impeccable. The food and ambience outstanding. Great location in the gothic quarter. A great place to use a a base for exploring Barcelona.,5,2019,09,30
14,Nice Hotel,"The hotel has good location, nice lobby and comfortable space, the bed is number one, I find the big difference here is that the staff are very friendly, and I appreciate that.
There may be several delicious dessert options to end for a perfect breakfast!",4,2019,09,27
14,Hotel Neri,Excellent staff and location - beautiful hotel in  center of Gothic district - restaurant offerings excellent and varied - comfortable bar area and pleasant outdoor patio - comfortable beds and quiet room ,5,2019,09,23
14,Best in Barcelona,Beautiful hotel wonderful staff and the restaurant is excellent - great location in the gothic district. No issues noise from the square right outside the window . The staff went above and beyond for our transportation needs. ,5,2019,09,22
14,"A peaceful, casual and luxurious retreat in just the right location","We spent five nights in this gem and could not have asked for anything more. The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of the buzzy gothic quarter. Yet it feels like a world away once you step through the doors. The staff are warm and professional and willing to do anything to make your stay the best it can be. A special shout out to bellman extraordinaire, Thomas. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious by European standards. Beds are very comfortable with soft sheets. Whatever you need is provided. Breakfast offerings are more than you can eat, with lots of hot and cold options. The hotel offers traditional rooms as well as apartments, which may be best suited to families. A first-class home away from home.",5,2019,09,16
14,the definition of luxury,"Spectacular hotel in a brilliant location. Attentive staff who will readily respond to your needs. We experienced what the luxury experience should be-beautiful, historic location, unparalleled service.
Only one recommendation-do not waste money on the transportation service-it is 90 euro from the airport to the hotel, with Neri proclaiming the advantage of being delivered door to door in a luxury vehicle, avoiding being dropped off in the square outside the Hotel by regular taxis.  We were picked up by a very pleasant driver in his immaculate Toyota(or Hyundai) and dropped off in the very square where the Hotel promises not to unload you(staff did come to help with the short walk to the Hotel).  Returning from the Hotel to the airport at departure-a regular taxi is 24-29 euro. Save the 70 euros for tapas and a nice bottle of wine. 
Apologies to spend so much time on one negative, but transportation just not worth it in any way.",5,2019,09,16
14,Summer Vacation,"OMGosh this hotel is amazing!! A little gem tucked away in the Gothic Area of Barcelona. The staff, the hotel, the restaurant, the lounge impeccable. Upon arriving we were greeted by Marcos and champagne. Walking distance to nearly everything. A wonderful tour company available next to the hotel for guided tours. This place is heaven on Earth. We will be returning soon:)",5,2019,09,14
14,Best hotel experience of my life !,"The staff is absolutely fantastic and detail oriented. From check in to check out, everything have been perfect. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable. If you are looking for a nice Roof too experience do not hesitate to visit their sister hotel The Wittmore - with its breathtaking scenery to its warm welcoming, you’ll be conquered.",5,2019,09,13
14,"Cozy, hidden retreat in the heart of Barcelona","Beautiful, relaxing oasis in the central Gothic area, close to the Cathedral for easy to find landmark. Start with a refreshing breakfast to provide energy for the day, and end the day with a Cava. The recently renovated rooms and apartments  are tasteful, and comfortable. The staff are attentive, and personable - It's like having a family home to come back to at the end of an exciting day! ",5,2019,09,11
14,Excellence in the heart of the Barri Gòtic,"Beautiful hotel with large comfortable rooms. The hotel staff is attentive and friendly, can assist guests in English. We were welcomed at check-in with a glass of cava (or water, if preferred). Breakfast in the hotel each morning offered a start of toast, croissants, fruit and yogurt, etc. then options for eggs and other complements to get the day off to a good start. Highly recommended. ",5,2019,09,09
14,wonderful family apartment,We stayed in a family apartment in a newly renovated building across from the hotel. The apartment is very well equipped and modern.   It was comfortable and we appreciated the washer/dryer and the mini fridge.  The hotel is in an excellent location in the Gothic Quarter.  We loved the rooftop pool with towels and water provided.  The hotel restaurant and bar are excellent with a generous breakfast and the best service we experienced during our entire Spain trip. My one suggestion is information in the apartment on using the air conditioner and the washer/dryer.  The units were very unlike those we are used to in the states and we were guessing at which buttons to use.,5,2019,08,28
14,Fantastic hotel!,"Beautiful hotel, in a fantastic location splat bang in the middle of the Gothic centre.
Spotlessly clean.
Easy to walk everywhere and about 6 minutes from the tube.
A special mention of Lara on reception, who is superb, nothing was too much trouble and she was always welcoming and smiling.
The breakfast comes on a tray loaded with many items. In addition to that you order from an extensive menu. It is beautifully presented and plentiful. 
We would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,08,28
14,Barcelon,My only complaint is the shower glass leaked onto the bathroom floor and poor lighting for putting on makeup etc. Apart from that it’s a lovely small personal hotel. The staff are very good and friendly. The rooms are great and plenty of room in our bedroom. It’s in a really nice part of Barcelona in the Gothic area.,5,2019,08,27
14,Needs service upgrade ,"Very nice hotel. We stayed in the apartments, which have good views. These are spare but well appointed, and note that the showers in 3 and 4 leak onto the smooth concrete floor creating a slipping hazard and not just in the bathroom. Great views from the rooftop deck/pool, too. The area is very active as late as 2 am, so there is some noise and revelry. Only the bravest taxi drivers will come to the door, so make sure your luggage is on wheels. Staff is friendly. Service in the restaurant and bar is slow, inefficient, and inattentive, as two other recent reviewers have noted. Basic staff training would solve that, and is clearly needed, as we were frequently left stranded. Hotel has access to excellent tour guides. Ask by name for Ramon, a true Catalan renaissance man, whose knowledge of Gaudi and the Gothic/Jewish quarter is probably unsurpassed. He is not cheap, but he is worth every penny and was probably the highlight of our trip. ",3,2019,08,25
14,Hotel Neri,Great location.In the heart of the Gothic Area.Beautiful hotel. Exactly where you want to be. Food excellent. Staff friendly and helpful. Well worth staying here. Lots of good restaurants just around the corner from the hotel,5,2019,08,21
14,Very very nice gem in Barcelona center,"Hotel Neri is a gem in Barcelona center 
The building is biutuful the decoration is time less and eclectic intelectual 
The staff is great the location very central it was my second time but will definitely come back ",5,2019,08,20
14,Loved the Neri Hotel,"From the nice people who greeted us at our car, to checkout, the Neri hotel experience was great.  The room was comfortable, and the bathroom was really nice.  This hotel is perfectly located next to the Gaudi Cathedral and there are many friendly shops (including grocery) near by.  The restaurant had fantastic dinner and breakfast items that I really liked (chicken dish was yummy).  I hope we get to stay this great spot again some day!",5,2019,08,19
14,Effortless luxury and perfect locaiton,"All aspects of this hotel are outstanding - the staff, the womderful rooms and sensitive use of the wonderfulancient building.  We stayed in one of the apartments almost directly opposite the hotel itself. These are  very thoughtfully designed and simply beautifull and luxuriously comfortable in a m odern understated way.  Every appliance is provided for cookking simple meals, and also a washing machine - so handy when travelling.  The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  The  breakfasts and other meals are of the highest quality.  Tparts of the city, the shopping areas and the Picasso Museum, and close to the metro.",5,2019,08,18
14,Pleasant trip,"Very good location, all most sightseeing within walking distance, but a little loud into the night. Restaurants also with walking distance. Difficult to rich the hotel by car ( pedestrian area). The apartment are a good cut area.",4,2019,08,06
14,Perfect,Loved this property and will definitely stay there again. My only gripe was the service in the restaurant which was slow. Greeting was quick but paying attention was not so good. Very difficult to get there attention. ,5,2019,08,06
14,What a palace!,"Right in the middle of the Gothic Quarter you have this beautiful small boutique hotel or should I say former palace. Easy to find even though your taxi can’t drop you off right outside, but location can’t be bettered for me. Great reception and Cava for us all on arrival with all the help and local info you could require. Rooms were of a very high standard with pillows to die for! Would we stay again? 100% yes you can’t go wrong at the Neri if you want to explore the wonderful old parts of Barcelona.",5,2019,08,03
14,Loved our stay,"My husband and I loved every moment of staying here. The hotel staff was warm, accomodating and went out of their way to help. The hotel is in a perfect location within the Gothic Quarter for those who love history and exploring. The hotel was beautiful, very clean and the rooms were great. ",5,2019,07,26
14,Excellent Stay and Hospitality at Hotel Neri!!!,"Best Hotel in Barcelona!!!! All the staff at the Hotel Neri were incredible, attentive, and willing to help. The hotel is beautiful and best location in Las Ramblas! Definitely would go back! This is a beautiful property in the heart of Las Ramblas, and so well centered to great shops and restaurants. We had an Apartment room and it was awesome and spacious for our Family. The building is unique, atmosphere is fantastic, and the small boutique hotel was awesome. The rooftop terrace and bar are awesome. Best Place in Barcelona if you are seeking to be in the heart of Las Ramblas and all the Action. Love it. ",5,2019,07,16
14,Luxury and location!,This hotel is wonderful.  Perfect location and the rooms are extremely quiet and comfortable.  I loved the bar and restaurant.  The service was great.  Everyone spoke English and made us feel welcome.  Can’t wait to go back!,5,2019,07,16
14,Fabulous Hotel in Gothic Quarter,"My husband and I chose Hotel Neri because it is part of Amex’s Fine Hotels; It lived up to every expectation you can imagine knowing that. 
The staff was always welcoming and when we asked for recommendations, they were also great! 

The location is in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, only accessible by walking. Taxis can drop/pick up in the nearest square, which is a 3 minute walk. 

My husband and I didn’t want to leave! ",5,2019,07,10
14,Little gem in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,Stunning property in a fabulous location. The apartments are great for a small family or a couple who need a little more space. We spent 6 nights there and it really felt like home. We could go downstairs for dinner knowing the kids were safe on their own. The pool is opening soon which will be a fantastic addition.,5,2019,07,07
14,Perfect location and service.,Neri is perfectly situated in the gothic quarter. The structure is an ideal blend of new and ancient. The food is good and the service impeccable. Only small downside is if arriving by car you’ll need to park a couple of blocks away because hotel is in pedestrian area. ,5,2019,07,05
14,Very nice ,"Here are all the things we loved about Hotel Neri: excellent and attentive staff, great food and a lovely bar to relax in, and a central location in the gothic city. We had one of the apartments--and it was nice and roomy, but pretty simply furnished and decorated; sort of minimalistic. The gothic quarter and The Neri are a lovely oasis in an extremely crowded city. ",4,2019,07,04
14,Definitely stay,The hotel is exceptional location for the historical party of Barcelona. Concierge staff is very knowledgeable and professional. They were excellent at setting up personal guides. I would highly recommend. ,5,2019,07,03
14,"Perfect Hotel, Perfect Location","We stayed in one of the apartments the hotel has since we were traveling with our kids.  The room was very spacious, had a full kitchen, fridge and dining table.  The view was so quaint. It looked down one of Barcelonas many walkways.  
The service was impeccable.  We were only there for a few days and the front desk recommended the perfect amount of activities for us to do. 
Restaurant was great as well.  We only had breakfast there, but it was perfect!
The beds and linens were comfortable and soft.!
Oh!  And the location.  if you come to Barcelona and you want to explore.  This is the place to stay.  You are 5 min from everything.",5,2019,07,01
14,Great hotel ,Great hotel in an awesome location in the gothic quarter. The hotel restaurant surprisingly had amazing food! Concierge is very nice and helpful. Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona ,4,2019,06,26
14,Great boutique hotel in the Gothic area,"This is a fun hotel with nice rooms, thick walls and friendly reception/management staff. The food was OK, but not special and the restaurant staff were fine, but not exceptional. 
Being situated in the middle of the Gothic area is convenient for sightseeing, although taxis cannot always reach it due to the narrow streets and some being closed. We would happily stay there again.",4,2019,06,23
14,Great stay,Awesome location. Walking distance to everything. If you have American Express Platinum card this is the best luxurious hotel you can stay at. The rooms are great and the staff is very friendly. 5 stars all around.,5,2019,06,22
14,Wonderful place,"We actually stayed June 2018 (forgot to post review). The desk staff were super nice and helpful. There were cookies available in the lobby that were delicious. Room was fantastic, loved the bathroom and bath items provided (smelled amazing). Breakfast, oh my goodness, loved it. Everything is so fresh. There is a rooftop area that looked great as well although we didn’t take advantage of it. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,06,20
14,Don't stay in this hotel.,"No doorman on weekends.  Musty smell inside. Bartender did not speak English, and did not know what Bourbon is.  Saturday concierge would not assist us in making a dinner reservation.  Waiters paid no attention to someone waiting for breakfast.  Power plugs inconveniently located near floor instead of next to beds. On arrival taxi could not drive up to hotel because street was too narrow.",2,2019,06,20
14,No 5 Star,"Ther Sewer smell throughtout the hotel made the stay a not so good experience. We cannot give enough praise to Juste & Juaquin. They went over & above what anyone could want to make our trip as nice as possible.Because we are getting our 1stnight refunded, it shows you are an honorable organization. The atmoshhere of the hotel would be wonderful but for the sewer problem",3,2019,06,20
14,Magnificent find in Barcelona,"Location for tourist sites is superb.  Overall ambience of the hotel is top quality.  Service cannot be surpassed. Hotel staff was extremely helpful in making suggestions, reservations and caring for our overall welfare.  If ever I return to Barcelona, I would definitely stay in Hotel Neri.  ",5,2019,06,18
14,In the heart of Quaint,"The Neri hotel is situated in the heart of the Old Gothic quarter of the beautiful city of Barcelona.   It’s nestled amongst a maze of cobbled alley ways where you can get lost very easily.  Lovely artsy stores, Tapas bars and authentic restaurants line the little streets.   The winding lanes open into different piazzas  some with magnificent cathedrals.  
The hotel is an oasis from the throngs of tourists. The hotel was built in an 1100’s building with parts of the original limestone walls  exposed, the hotel was transformed into a stylish and contemporary space.
We had booked our luxury room through American Express and because there was availability the concierge kindly upgraded us to a mini suite.   This was an extra large room with a sitting area as well as the kingside bed.   The room was spotless and tastefully decorated.   The room had large windows on both sides but because the neighboring buildings are so close we had to keep the drapes shut the entire time.   This is understandable given the location of the hotel but it was somewhat unnerving. 
In the hotel is a wonderful restaurant aptly called A Restaurant.    We had a fresh and delicious breakfast every morning and large selection of tasty tapas and dinners. 
Everything was cooked to perfection and displayed creatively.   
There is a good bar with competent and friendly staff. One can have the choice of eating inside or out in the evenings,  by the adjoining  peaceful fountain square.
The reason I couldn’t give this hotel five stars is because of the narrow location,  taxis cannot drive to pick you up or drop you off.   The closest square is the pick up and drop off place.  This of course is not the hotels fault but it was an inconvenience.   ",4,2019,06,17
14,Great Value for Money in Shoulder Season,"Great location and beautiful old, historic building. Worth the visit. Highly recommend their restaurant. We didn’t have breakfast but had dinner and drinks. Meal was phenomenal. Service by staff was also great.",4,2019,06,17
14,Great location in Gothic Quarter ,This hotel is very unique and has an awesome location. You do have to walk from a couple blocks away because the street is too narrow for a taxi but that adds to the charm. The staff was accommodating. We enjoyed breakfast every morning and had lunch there one day and we followed the waiters recommendations which were great. ,5,2019,06,17
14,Lovely hotel,This hotel is in the lovely old part of Barcelona. Great spot and the breakfast was superb. We would recommend this hotel to all our friends. Great little restaurants all around. It was also very quiet for resting.,5,2019,06,17
14,Wonderful Hotel,We have had two short stays at this hotel and we stay there again if we every go back to Barcelona. It's a beautiful boutique hotel in one of the most interesting parts of the city. It's walking distance to almost every sight we wanted to see. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel room was spacious and well appointed.,5,2019,06,16
14,Could Be Better,"While set in a beautiful Gothic castle, the food selection was very limited, the bathroom shower was not designed correctly causing flooding to the bathroom floor while showering, and the beds were not that comfortable.  Despite its high ratings on Trip Advisor and Andrew Harper, we were disappointed.  There was no concierge service and while the staff were nice they were not helpful in arranging or knowing much of the plethora of activities Barcelona has to offer.  All-in-all we'd rate the Neri Hotel a 3 star, not the five star as advertised.",3,2019,06,16
14,Great location,"The Hotel Neri is a quiet place to relax, dine and rest in an otherwise very busy location. We enjoyed the eclectic spaces and very young staff. Breakfast is amazing and the rooms are quiet, with very comfortable beds. If you need dining reservations elsewhere, make them on your own. ",4,2019,06,16
14,Great boutique hotel,Had an amazing time in Barcelona.  Nice hotel with great service.  Really central location in the old quarter.  Make  Sure to try the restaurant breakfast.   Hotel was actually very quiet and the rooms comfortable. ,5,2019,06,16
14,Fantastic family stay!,"Our second visit to Hotel Neri. Stayed in the apartments- absolutely perfect for our family of 4. Location is amazing, staff was helpful, kind and always available. Highly recommend! We cannot wait to come back.",5,2019,06,16
14,Amazing,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Neri for 4 nights and had an amazing stay. From the moment we entered the the door we were treated like royalty, the staff could not do enough for us during our stay.
Beautiful hotel in an amazing location.
We shall return, thanks to all who made our visit to Barcelona memorable.",5,2019,06,16
14,Best in Barcelona,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful ambience, terrific staff.  While the city was particularly crowded during our visit, and the weather not idea, it made our stay special.  After fighting the throngs of tourists all day, it was a relief to come back to the hotel, sit in the bar/restaurant (particularly the window looking out onto the plaza), have coffee or a bite to eat, and relax.  A welcome and romantic respite.",5,2019,06,14
14,Stunningly beautiful place on a quiet square in the heart of the city,"The title says it all, no?  The Hotel Neri is gorgeous, quiet, and yet right in the heart of the old city of Barcelona (steps from the Rambla, the famous market, and the cathedral).  The staff is also kind and very helpful, and there is a very tasty breakfast.  We were there for a special occasion and felt well taken care of.",5,2019,06,14
14,Barcelona  first time stay," We arrived from long trip from California and we were tired but happy to stay in a small hotel in central historic section of Barcelona near the cathedral  The hotel exceeded our expectations and provide excellence service . They recommended a private guide made reservations and assisted me in getting tickets to a soccer match to see Messi and Barcelona's team at their home stadium  I highly recommend the hotel   ",5,2019,06,14
14,Inadequate Staff,"Majority of staff had very little training and had lots of difficulty satisfying our requirements.  When I first contacted Hotel regarding Guide Services they suggested I go directly to one agency -  Which I did and had no issues.  When we wanted to have a second tour the Hotel Manager insisted they handle, but made us use a different credit card (which meant I had to pay a fx transaction fee) - although it was same travel service.  All in all a bust.",1,2019,06,14
14,Great location! Great Service!,"We had an amazing time staying at the Neri. The staff was great. They made our trip to Barcelona very special. Location was amazing, and the hotel is beautiful. We will be staying there again next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,14
14,Charm and style in Barcelona,"Located down a narrow lane..a beautiful surprise! Lovely small hotel with charm and sophistication.
Breakfast is wonderful! Staff very helpful and knowedgeble. highly recommend when visiting barcelona. ",5,2019,06,14
14,Great stay,"I think additional people should be added at the front desk. We waited around 15 minutes to check in
because they were helping someone else. Every time we wanted to speak to the concierge we had to wait. A guest should not have to wait to be accommodated.
",5,2019,06,14
14,"You can't go wrong staying here, it's amazing","I have nothing bad to say about Hotel Neri and I would go back to Barcelona specifically to stay at this hotel. It's such a delight. We stayed in the annex building in a one bedroom apartment. It had a washer/drier, amazing rain shower, huge comfortable bed, floor to ceiling windows. It was great. The breakfasts at Relais & Chateaux are always wonderful. The staff is super friendly. And like all great hotels it's not overdone. There isn't any false acting. This is the real deal.",5,2019,06,14
14,Clean centrally located gem,"After doing a long cruise we found this gem of a hotel as recommended by our travel agent. The location was perfect for us walking around and enjoying the city of Barcelona. The room was very comfortable and inside amenities such as the roof top bar, the inside breakfast room / restaurant were easier to use. 

Our only challenges were the single threaded staff check-in process which left us waiting awhile. Also having checked in earlier than our party of 12 we were left waiting-almost the entire day for a room. Although we were able to use the stored luggage area which as great, we had to come back twice for jackets as the weather was cold which was disruptive to the staff.",4,2019,06,14
14,A wonderful experience!,"If you ever have the chance to visit the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona, this is the place to stay!  Romantic, comfortable, private,  and surrounded by history, you will not be disappointed. In addition, perhaps the most helpful staff we have ever experienced. A truly five star stay!",5,2019,06,14
14,Gothic neighborhood treasure,"This hotel is lovely and perfectly situation for exploring the gothic barrio.  But -- streets are so narrow that taxis cannot generally make it to the hotel, so be prepared to be dropped off or picked up a few blocks away at San Jaume plaza.... kind of painful if you are travelling with a lot of luggage like we were.  Also - we ordered a room with a terrace and got a room looking out into the alley with no terrace.  That was a disappointment.  But the room was nice.",5,2019,06,14
14,Wonderful hotel,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona.  Spacious and comfortable room, great service by the staff.  When we arrived they did not have a reservation due to an IT snafu but bent over backwards to accommodate us and work it out.  We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Neri and when we return to Barcelona will stay there again.",5,2019,06,14
14,Good solution in the center of Barcelona,"The hotel is in the center of the Gothic area, nice place but too expensive for the services that are given.
Clean rooms but very limited spaces. We stayed with the children taking two rooms. I don't love talking about money but I think the amount we paid is too high. I am sure that there are cheaper and equal quality solutions, for the service and the staff I have nothing to say, they have been very kind and professional",3,2019,06,14
14,Great hotel in a perfect location,This is a very nice boutique hotel hotel.  We had a nice suite with kitchen across the street.  It was completely quiet.  The bedding was very comfortable.  We stayed three nights and walked everywhere except the cathedral.  The hotel hired a guide for the cathedral and that made it so much more enjoyable.  ,5,2019,06,14
14,Stay at Hotel Neri,"The hotel was lovely and positioned perfectly and staff very welcoming .
We had a couple of issues with the room, the main issue was with the shower going cold after approx. 10 mins so I couldn't finish washing my hair with warm water just had to quickly rinse it in cold !
Then had to wait about 1/2 hour for it to warm up !I felt we were fobbed of by the staff who came to look at it , we felt like they didn't believe us even though the water was cold they suggested we wait for it to warm up ! this is not something you expect to encounter .
The other issue was we ran out of toilet rolls and shower gel.
It is nice to have chocolates and flowers but get the basic things right first !

The other suggestion is have some normal tea bags available, the first day it was fine then after that it went downhill we were told the raspberry ones were normal tea bags etc !!
All I wanted was a cup of black tea but that proved impossible.
The beds are very comfortable are the rest of the breakfast was ok but for the money I probably wouldn't stay again because of the shower issue.
",4,2019,06,14
14,We loved Barcelona.,"Our only observation is the bad toilet smell throughout the hotel, other than the entrance where the smell is obscured through some form of perfume and the room as long as we lit the perfume sticks.  Being such an old building this is an understandable problem and may be impossible to fix. Apart from this, we loved our stay with you and your terrific staff.",5,2019,06,14
14,Excellent location good service,"Other than WIFI, everythingelse are OK.

Location is smack in the middle of gothic quarter and next to the cathedral.
Only a short stroll from taxi stand.

Our bag was stolen at a nearby coffee shop next to the extremely busy La Rambla street; during the aftermath, the hotel staffs helped us a lot with communication with the police and calling our banks to block our credit cards. 

The hotel room is clean and spacious. Be mindful that there’s only a bathtub and it’s slippery to take a shower in it.

Hotel interior is picturesque, with a touch of modernism on a gothic canvas.
 
",5,2019,06,14
14,Loved the location and room!,Excellent and quiet location. The Gothic quarter is a wonderful location. Great concierge and staff with excellent recommendations and service.Loved the soothing room and stone shower with Mouton Brown amenities. ,5,2019,06,10
14,Top Notch,"Wonderful hotel, great staff and beautiful rooms. Breakfast was awesome....really can't say enough about the hotel. 
Booked thru Amex Fine Hotels so got (and utilized) the early and late check-in & check-out. Also the $100 credit along with free breakfast all improved the already reasonable price of roughly $400",5,2019,05,30
14,Disappointed,"Staff is not helpful, hotel is not your usual 5 star property - rooms are too simple, facing the fence, breakfast setup has a weird format- trays that are similar to the airplane meals set up. Service is very slow. 
Absolutely not a Relais and chateaux property!",3,2019,05,30
14,Great hotel and staff.,Everything about the hotel met or exceeded expectations.  It has a convenient location and it was great to wander the surrounding area.  What impressed us most was the friendliness and knowledge of a very accommodating staff/,5,2019,05,27
14,"Not great value for money, sadly…","This pricey property comes highly recommended from the Telegraph,  and it is also listed in Rick Steves’ book.  On this basis I thought it would be much more impressive, considering the price of the room. To his credit, the hotel is located on a very quiet street in the old quarter. However it is a complete pain in the ass to get to via taxi and Hotel pick up Service from the airport is you ser to his credit, the hotel is located on a very quiet street in the old quarter. To the back of the hotel is the tiny and beautiful Neri square. Our room faced directly on the Square, and while it was beautiful, the hubbub from the neighbouring school and  daily gamut of tour groups walking in and out was extremely loud. This would annoy many travelers.

Be very aware it is a complete pain in the ass to get to via taxi  because of the location in the warren of tiny streets.  Be prepared to haul your bags on the cobblestones for a few blocks, and potentially get a little lost on the way. Also know that the Hotel pick up Service from the airport is  prohibitively expensive, at 90 or 100 euros.

 The hotel offers no breakfast unless you pay an expensive upcharge.  Even at €45 this is not really good value for money. There are lots of good breakfast options in the immediate area.",1,2019,05,22
14,Small Luxury Hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"Wonderful small hotel in the Gothic quarter that can be hard to find, even with a map (as many of the streets are small and their names are not included on the map). A warm welcome by the front desk and then led to our third floor room which included a hot tub on the balcony. A bottle of cava on ice was waiting for us to celebrate our special occasion anniversary. The room was nicely appointed and included a huge bathroom with a powerful shower.
The restaurant overlooked a very picturesque court yard with outdoor dining in warmer weather. We thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant at dinner with their tasty tapas choices and Spanish wine (waiter recommended). Breakfast, on the other hand, had nice choices, although service and timing were not as efficient as in the evening. Staff were very helpful and friendly. As cars cannot arrive at the hotel, bellman escorts you and take your bags to your car. On the day we left, police closed most of central Barcelona and the bellman had to take our bags about five minutes away to our waiting taxi. Thank you for this wonderful service.",4,2019,05,21
14,Hotel Neri,Hotel Neri is situated in the centre of the old quarter of Barcelona and very convenient for visiting interesting sites in the city. THe hotel is exceptionally pleasant and comfortable and the staff could not be more helpful and friendly.,5,2019,05,21
14,Anniversary trip,"Excellent service in every way. Staff wonderful and will arrange anything. Shout out to private guide Ramon !! General manager extremely helpful. 
Loved washing machine in apartment and obtaining tickets to soccer match.",5,2019,05,15
14,Absolutely Wonderful!  ,"Stayed five nights in one of the six apartments adjoining the main building. Great location and Clara and the front desk team couldn’t be more helpful! Very private and beautifully appointed
Apartment with washer / dryer - kitchen area and separate bedroom. Breakfast was included and it too was fabulous. 5 stars plus for the Neri!!",5,2019,05,13
14,Hidden secret in the best location of Barcelona! EXCELLENT for families- Apart/Hotel!!!,"I hope this review doesn't get the secret out to one of the best hotels located in the Gothic Quarter (within walking distance to everything you need to see in Barcelona!).  We stayed in the apartment section of the hotel which had a kitchen, living area with pull out bed, and separate room. It was so amazing to have these amenities especially with kids. The view from our room was looking into the Gothic Quarter. We had the best of both worlds- apartment like hotel with all the amenities and services of a hotel. Every morning we had a delicious breakfast delivered in the comfort of our hotel room.  The front desk was also one of the main reasons why we would return. They were so helpful and very accomodating to our needs. Xavi (Chavi) at the front desk was so helpful in finding us a good pizza place to deliver food one night where we didn't want to go out and eat. He went above and beyond to find us a good place to order (he called 3 places until he found us a good delivery place!). He also helped me find a tech store to buy an adapter so we can charge our phones. Thank you to everyone! We will definitely be coming back to this luxurious, clean, and wonderful hotel! Oh- and the restaurant was one of the best meals we had in Barcelona. Gourmet twist to Spain food!! (Note: we are foodies and are very critical of the quality of food!).",5,2019,05,11
14,Not our favorite in Barcelona,"Stayed one night only in hotel Neri. Pros were The building is charming and well designed, our room and patio were lovely and staff were pleasant. End of pro’s. 

Cons: 

The hotel stinks. Thanks to the Gòtic quarter location, the sewage system is not ideal. Road restrictions prohibit some driving and one bellman came to take our luggage near st James square with no cart. It was insufficient and we ended up dragging our luggage through the old quarter. Not a warm welcome. 

The restaurant was out of almost anything for two people in our party who chose to dine there. A five star hotel should have a five star restaurant. Room service menu was a sad little disappointment as well. Wine bottles in the minibar, not no wine glasses to be found. 

The hotel is right next to an extremely loud elementary school, making an afternoon siesta near impossible to enjoy. 

Overall we enjoyed being in the location where we were and liked the stylish hotel, but felt that the hotel is undeserving of its five star status and perhaps we would next choose The Edition hotel for our stay in Barcelona, it has the same design, glamour, and services as it’s counterparts in NYC and Miami.  ",3,2019,05,09
14,Neri,"It was the classiest place I've ever stayed at... the only down side was the old building sewage system... you could smell the feces in your bedroom.  But if you pop a window and run the water a bit you'll minimize the smell.

(The shower was my favorite part of the room)",5,2019,05,07
14,Awesome hotel with unbeatable location,We stayed in a Deluxe Terrace room. Very charming room with a spacious terrace where you can read or enjoy your coffee next to an orange tree. There was even a bath tub where you could enjoy some outdoor bath experience. The staff was very friendly and attentive helping us to get a reservation last minute at Bar Cañete were we had a wonderful meal for dinner. The breakfast is perfectly designed and served in a romantic setting with some tables having views to the nice square in the gothic quarter that is full of history. We enjoyed the stay very much and would definitely stay here again. ,5,2019,05,01
14,Barcelona Hotel,"The hotel is in a great location in Barrí Gòtic. My room was very comfortable, with a lovely view of a tiny square with an historic church, however there was an unpleasant  odour from outside drains which required the air conditioner to be on fan at all times. The staff were extremely helpful and the hotel amenities were good.",4,2019,05,01
14,Lovely hotel - great location,"We stayed here based on the recommendation of a friend. It is brilliantly located in the old town just around the corner from the Cathedral.  We had a lovely, comfortable room over looking a small square with a church (not noisy) and a school (a little noisy at drop of and pick up) but the room was very well sound proofed.  The staff were very helpful.  Only marked down from 5/5 due to the cost of breakfast - we just ate out every morning. 
Good cocktails in the bar.",4,2019,04,30
14,Amazing stay,"Beautiful apartment in excellent location. Well kept and maintained. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Excellent amenities. Great breakfast which we chose to be included into our room option. Cab can't always pull up to the door because of the narrow street, but staff was always available to tote luggage.",5,2019,04,23
14,Wonderful stay in my favorite city!,"Fabulous hotel, amazing staff, great location, and a wonderful end to a three week vacation.  Highly recommend and looking forward to staying there again next year.  Loved being near the cathedral, especially when we got lost navigating the streets.  Always, found our way home.",5,2019,04,23
14,Hotel Neri is a dream.,This Relais & Chatueax property comes up to the highest standards set by this group with superior architectural and historical significance in a pristine restoration. The location is in the heart of the Barrii Gotic with  its twisting tangle of medieval streets. It is very quiet and the children going and coming to the Catholic school in the adjoining Place San Felipe Neri adds additional charm. The church in the Placa was the church Gaudi attended everyday.  The restaurant is especially excellent with the most inventive small plates in town. ,5,2019,04,18
14,A Gothic Area Treasure with a personal touch,"I stayed at the Hotel Neri for 4 nights and had unbelievable service. It was as if I had a personal concierge the entire time. Several venues were recommended for visits, plus when I returned late in the evening, the dining room prepared a meal for me, even though they were closed.",5,2019,04,15
14,Step back to relax,"As you wind your way through the cobblestoned lane ways of old Barcelona it’s as if by magic that Hotel Neri appears like a sanctuary for the tired traveller.  Having travelled directly from Melbourne Australia we were indeed weary. 

As the glass and wrought iron door opens for you, you enter a calming and beautifully appointed entrance that gives you a brief glimpse into the world of 12 century to 18 century Barcelona. The rich decor is complemented by soft, yet interesting lighting.

Step further into the Hotel and you will be greeted by welcoming staff ready to offer the weary traveller a drink of something refreshing or a meal in the beautiful adjoining restaurant. 

The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The bed (king size) was comfortable, with beautiful linens. The bed was firm but inviting. 

The bathroom consisted of a shower above the bath, which was long enough to accomodate the tallest of traveller, in need of a long hot soak. The towels were beautiful in their quality, large and soft. 

There’s coffee available in the room, along with robes and slippers,  and a strong and powerful hairdryer. Airconditioning certainly helped as the weather turned warm. 

The breakfast is a wonderful start to the day, and the French Toast is a must. At the end of the day a glass of wine from the carefully considered wine list is a must. Team the Riesling with the cheese croquettes! Mmm! 

So after four nights was I ready to say goodbye? No. 

I’ve decided that instead of saying goodbye, I’ll say I’ll see you soon Hotel Neri. 

If you want to stay in a boutique hotel that helps to make you feel special, then I recommend Hotel Neri.

",5,2019,04,13
14,A real gem in the Gothic quarter,"Hotel Neri is the most perfect hotel. It is situated down a small lane right in the middle of the gothic quarter. The hotel is old but it has been renovated beautifully with every modern fixture you could possibly want. The rooms are gorgeous with a huge bed and equally huge white sofa. The bathroom is a delight. I really cannot praise this gorgeous hotel highly enough, I would love to return to see the Familia Segrada when it is complete and will be staying at the Neri. The staff are equally delightful, charming and attentive. Cars are not allowed down the road that the hotel is on but please don’t let this put you off, your bags are collected from the car and taken back to the car while you stroll along behind gazing at the amazing view of the church and enjoying the hustle and bustle of the square.",5,2019,04,11
14,Excellent hotel,"We recently stayed at Hotel Neri.
Wonderful building, friendly and warmly staff. Clean room and good service.
Only breakfast, which is served (no buffet) a little bit too little. Each day the same sausages and fruits. ",4,2019,04,10
14,"Location, Location, Location!","Beautiful boutique hotel in the perfect location. Staff very helpful and made sure our stay was a top notch experience. Perfect home base for walking all around the city, though public transportation also very close. We will certainly go back!",5,2019,04,02
14,Historic hotel with modern amenities in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"We loved getting lost in the narrow, winding streets that hide the Hotel Neri. Finding the hidden shops,  best churros, tapas bars and restaurants in this area was a lot of fun.  Churros at Granja Dulcinea on Carrer Petritxol were our favourite.    The location of the hotel meant that we could walk to most major attractions such as La Bouqueria market, Museu Picasso, Las Ramblas and even La Sagrada Familia (40 minutes) and come back for an afternoon siesta.   The modern amenities, cleanliness of the rooms and quality of service in this historic hotel made for a wonderful stay.  We stayed in a terrace room on the 3rd floor  and enjoyed the extra outdoor space to have a glass of wine and share a few of the delightful desserts from nearby Caelum cafe.   
The restaurant in the hotel was fabulous for experiencing a creative take on the local cuisine.   All the dishes we tried were delicious and the presentation beautiful.   ",5,2019,03,31
14,"Wonderful location, great staff, perfect for a visit to BCN","We stayed at the Neri for five days, and then went to Ibiza, and then returned to stay at the Neri again for a few days.  It is in the gothic quarter.  Narrow streets, many excellent pubs and restaurants, and some amazing shops.  And only a few blocks from the Rambla.  The hotel itself has large rooms, all modern facilities.  The staff is super -- very helpful and they will call places for you to arrange for taxis, tickets, reservations.  The bar is fun in late evening.  We never ate there because there are so many other places nearby.  One possible hitch: the street is so narrow that some taxis will want to drop you off Plaza Sant Jaume.  That is not a problem unless you have a ton of baggage.  Most normal sized taxis will take you right to the hotel. Ask for Gita at the desk -- she is amazing.  And take a look at the gift shop next door.  Their prices are very good.",5,2019,03,26
14,Incredible hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona,"Wonderful accommodations. We had a Junior Suite overlooking the courtyard. Lovely windows opened up to let the fresh air of early spring in.  Immaculately clean and comfortable. Since I don't like elevators, I climbed up the 3 flights of stairs which for me, is no big deal.  Hotel is charming and dimly lit.  The bathroom was roomy and had all the comforts of a 5 star hotel. The shampoo and conditioner where luxurious on my long hair, but I digress.  Breakfast was lovely, served on long plates consisting of fresh cheeses, fruit, yogurt and granola. Then there was a choice of something hot off the menu.  The restaurant had special dishes that we didn't venture to try.  We had room service which was great.  The staff was wonderful, polite and friendly, always ready to help. Located in the Gothic Quarter, with close access to everything. La Rambla was only a fun 10 minute walk, passing shops and interesting streets.  If we get to Barcelona again, we will surely stay there again.  Totally recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,03,25
14,Amazing Medieval Boutique hotel,"We had the chance of staying at Hotel Neri for one night and wished we could have stayed longer. 
The Hotel is beautiful, the interior design very cosy, the employees are nice and helpful. Breakfast is divine and so it the bed linen!
The localisation is great: in the center of the Barrio Gotico, close to everything.  Thank you Hotel Neri!",5,2019,03,24
14,Perfect small hotel in a perfect neighborhood...,"My stay in Barcelona was too short at two days, however, this Relais & Chateaux property made it very comfortable and lovely. Their (pre-arranged) driver was waiting for me at the airport. This hotel was found down the small alley-like streets of the Gothic quarter; this hotel is perfect for travelers that like small properties which are special in the atmosphere, service, décor, accommodation, and hospitality. I had reserved one room for two nights and two additional rooms for one night (my family arrived). There was, initially (before arrival), a glitch between the hotel reservation system and the R&C system, however, the staff cleared up the problem. Everything they did is done with a smile. The rooms were very clean, comfortable, well-appointed and lovely. There is a charming, small square to one side of the hotel that opens onto a church entrance (chillingly scarred by bullets and shrapnel from the Spanish Civil Way of the 1930s) and a children’s school. While it’s perfectly quiet in the afternoon and nights, if you’re a late sleeper, you should consider a white-noise app for your phone or tablet/pad because the children frolic in the square and may be heard. Not a problem… just forewarned is forearmed. Breakfast is a delicious served Continental-type but served to you by a lovely and accommodating staff. However, a breakfast entrée may be ordered. It was perfect. All in all, we loved our stay.",5,2019,03,23
14,Amazing!!!,"Absolutely amazing stay at Hotel Neri! Attentive, kind and professional staff. Wonderful (and I mean wonderful) room and general atmosphere. And delicious food! Well worth the cost for this luxury stay!",5,2019,03,23
14,They lied about the rooftop terrace,"The staff lied about the terrace not being open for those outside the hotel. Apparently, the terrace “used to be open before but not anymore starting with this year”. That is not true! I can understand that they have the right to select their customers (although there was absolutely no reason for that due to the circumstance!) but I think it’s pathetic to just lie to someone’s face especially when they had been there days before. And if they don’t allow the access then at least they should make sure to specify it on their web, social media and also make sure that there’s no false information out there, so at least they can avoid making people waste their time. Also the concierge (or whoever that person was) had no customer care skills unfortunately.",1,2019,03,16
14,This hotel oozes charm,"My friend and I stayed at the Hotel Neri in September, 2018.  We were thrilled with our room in the Casa Neri Apartments - still close enough to get the full service of a hotel, but nice to have a little independence with a sitting room and kitchen.  The bed was very comfortable, towels and toiletries extremely nice, breakfast was delicious and service top-notch.  But the real reason to stay here is the location and the charm of the setting - the winding streets of the Gothic Quarter, what looks like original stonework on some of the walls, and all the little touches the combine old world charm with new world comforts.  It definitely became a highlight of our Barcelona experience.",4,2019,03,15
14,Great,"A great place to stay. Not cheap, but amazing ambiance, from the moment  you walk in until it's finally time to leave. Situated in the gothic quarter, close to the cathedral in one direction, not far from las Ramblas in the other. ",5,2019,03,14
14,A perfect hotel by all accounts in the best location in all of Barcelona,"Our hotel was the highlight of our trip to Barcelona. We stay around the world always seeking out charming boutique hotels that strike the balance of small but not to small. Its a perfect mix of charming yet modern and warm still sexy. The staff was exceptionally personal and attentive.

I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.",5,2019,03,13
14,"Convenient, Romantic, Lucurious Stay!","Hotel Neri is the perfect blend of modern luxury and Old-World charm. We stayed in their apartments, and it was so convenient to have a full kitchen and all the hotel amenities. We had our friend staying on the couch and he had no complaints. The housekeeping team did a great job of turning down the apartment at night and supplying enough towels for all of us. 

I've been to Barcelona a half dozen times and this was the first time I stayed in the Bari Gotic and I was not disappointed. I was afraid the neighborhood would be overly touristy, but everyday it was a delight making our way through the labyrinthine streets and popping into the many local mom and pop shops in the area.",5,2019,03,11
14,Highly Recommended in great location,"excellent service by all employees, friendly and very helpful. we loved the aptments we stayed in during 2 different visits in february and march. Would be nice to have a small exercise gym room, especially for travelers.",5,2019,03,07
14,Little Gem in the Gothic Quarter,"Pictures don't fully support what you will expect. It is quite a mix of Stlyes which worried me first. But being there, this worrys vanished immidiately. The Atosphere is welcoming and cosy. The Staff as well is extremly helpful and we felt comfortable the whole stay. ",5,2019,03,06
14,Perfect for first timers,"The second I walked into the hotel I was amazed by how gorgeous it is, as others are mentioning it's found in the Gothic quarter, and has a medieval look, with contemporary furniture. My room was gorgeous, with very high ceilings which gave a very grand look, the location is absolutely the best in town, and that's really why we chose the hotel, close to the Picasso museum, cathedrals, markets, Las Ramblas.. This is the place to stay, especially for first timers in Barcelona.",5,2019,01,21
14,Hardly a 5 Star Experience - Not worth the money,"This will be a rather long review but do yourself a favor and read it all.
I hesitated writing this review, if fact after being contacted by the Hotel Neri to write a review on Trip Advisor we opted to email the Management about our experience. That was back at the end of Nov 2018. It is now Jan 2019 and they never responded. What follows is what we sent them back in November 2018.... I am attaching photos to this review which show details what is in this review. 

""I received an email generated from your hotel, prompting me to leave a review on Tripadvisor. I would be remiss in doing so if I did not first, attempt to contact you regarding my recent stay at your Hotel Neri and my almost complete dissatisfaction with our stay.

First to highlight the positives, the location was indeed terrific, being in the heart of the Gothic neighborhood. The front desk and receiving staff were professional, personable and attentive. The common areas although not used, were all staged very appealingly.

On the negative side, while the Hotel Neri strives for modernism in its ancient beginnings, travelers such as ourselves do not expect minimalism. As a guest of a 5 star hotel I expect a place to hold or store my luggage and a large closet to hang my cloths, instead my suitcase and my husbands had to be put on the floor and the small cupboard covered with a curtain was only large enough for us to hang a fewe items and stow one carry on bag. At the very least there should have been foldable luggage racks for our suitcases instead of having to place and live out of them on the floor.

In a 5 star hotel I expect to have a place to put my toiletry items in the bathroom where they are not in peril of falling off the only tiny storage shelf and into the toilet or stack them haphazardly on the red metal stool under the sink. I also expect to find some niceties in the bathroom like a shower cap and some physical bars of bath soap. I would also like to hang my towels on a rack that can actually accommodate them and a bathrobe, rather than finding my towels in a pile on the floor becuse the tiny metal knobs mounted on the walls couldn't hold anything more than a baseball cap. 

In a 5 star hotel I would also expect the floors to be clean and discovered after wiping a spill in front of the mini-fridge that the floor was FILTHY.

I also expect that the trash would be emptied daily, and that for peak season rates during off season that the “complementary” bottle of water in the room would be replaced each night, neither which happened. Furthermore, when I asked the front desk where I could get some ice I was told to go to the bar and ask for it. When I did, they did provide me a small bucket and jokingly said, “that will be 10Euro….just kidding”. A five star hotel would have had ice waiting in my room or an offer to bring up the ice.

Overall the small, cramped room with the cheap floor lamp listing to one side, the broken little table and two small chairs that were neutral and inexpensive at best and lighting that was dim made the room cramped and is hardly by any standards considered a 5 star property. I might also add that there was a crack on the ceiling and scuff marks along the floors.

Lastly, as we were only on the second floor we often took the stairs which was dirty, marred and at different times cluttered with racks, carts and other miscellaneous items that was not only unsightly but could offer safety issues in the event that there was an emergency.

I feel that for spending over $340 euro a night that we were completely taken advantage of and would never recommend the Hotel Neri.""",1,2019,01,18
14,Fabulous small hotel in Gothic quarter - Exquisite service!,"What a great, charming Hotel - from the warm and genuine welcome -and the staff are always so eager to help with every detail.  It feels like you're in a medeival castle location - with the warm glow of candles and stone facades. 

Our room (Jr. Suite) was very large - a high (15 ft ceiling) with wood beams overlooking the square.  We enjoyed the lounge area for tapas and night caps.  Service was just exceptional - from meeting us out in square to assist with luggage (hotel is on pedestrian only alley) - to helping with museum tickets and restaurant reservations. Location couldn't be more perfect to explore the Gothic quarter and areas from there.  It offers a personalized, intimate feel - and was perfect for our family of 4.

I'll be back!",5,2019,01,11
14,Best hotel ever,"Great hotel, amazing location, wonderful staff....stay here.  We had a suite in their apartments next door.  It had a kitchen and fridge, so you could eat all that awesome food/wine from the markets in the comfort of your hotel...it was wonderful.",5,2018,12,15
14,Hotel Neri Barcelona,Excellent small hotel in convenient location with old world charm combined with modern facilities. Rooms are very comfortable and roomy including lounge area to relax in. Dining area is. Great for breakfast and for dinner with a very good menu available. Staff at reception and Resturant are very helpful and pleasant and multilingual. Most welcoming and make the stay more enjoyable ,5,2018,12,15
14,Perfect location for Gothic quarter  stay in Barcelona,Fantastic location for exploring this unique city. Get lost and found wandering through the streets and eating at all the bars. Would love to come stay again in 2026 when the sagrada familia is complete.,5,2018,12,13
14,Great stay at a first class hotel,"This is a truly great hotel.  From the moment you arrive you feel welcomed.  They really do go out of their way to help in any way possible.  The hotel is small, but has all of the services you would want in a great location.  We stayed in the apartments, which are right across the road from the hotel entrance.  Very nice, with more than enough room for 2.  We booked using the AMEX Fine Hotels and so breakfast was included in our rate and it was really good with plenty of food.  For 2 days we had it delivered to the room.  Small but nice roof deck.  We were there in November so the bar on the deck was not open but one afternoon we grabbed a bottle of wine and went up there for sunset.  The only thing to be aware of is that the street it is on is very narrow and some cab drivers understandably won't deliver you to the front door.  They take you to a square a block or so away, but if walking is an issue arrange your cab through the hotel since the company they used did make it to the hotel entrance.",5,2018,12,12
14,Great location and hotel restaurant,Hotel Neri is very well situated. The highlight for us was the innovative menu and warm service at the hotel restaurant. We dined there twice(unusual for us) and the other evenings would come back for a late evening drink and dessert. The meals were informal but outstanding and the atmosphere warm and inviting. The bartender was an artist and delight to watch preparing cocktails.,4,2018,12,09
14,"Charming Hotel, Very Attentive Service, Unbeatable Location","I can not rate this hotel high enough. The test of a great hotel is how problems are handled. We needed a room change upon arrival due to my error in booking. It is a small hotel  and we were staying five nights. Jacopo , the front office manager , listened carefully to me , explained the challenges and assured me he would solve the problem . He did just that with charm and extreme attention to detail.The rooms are a great blend of historic detail and modern comfort. The bar/ lounge is comfortable and staffed by personable servers who make a good drink. The breakfast is interesting and delicious . The location is as perfect as you can get . The doorman/ valet staff consistently  go above and beyond in offering assistance and recommendations. The housekeeper went out of her way to accommodate our room change. We can’t wait to go back and have already recommended this hotel twice to friends . ",5,2018,12,03
14,Hotel Neri,Wonderful service.  Excellent in all ways.  The room was quiet and comfortable.  We liked the design and location of the hotel.  It was very convenient.  One of us got sick and they arranged a get a doctor.  Very helpful.,5,2018,11,30
14,"Great location, great service","We stayed at the Hotel Neri for 5 nights in November 2018.  The location of the hotel is great, walking distance to many of the areas tourists would want to go, and in the heart of the Gothic Quarter.  We rented an apartment as we wanted kitchen facilities which is a short walk across the street from the hotel itself.  The apartment worked out great for our needs.   We didn't use the laundry faciilities and dishwasher but apartment came equipped with both. The bathroom was a bit cramped for 3 people and the housekeeping service could use some attention..  Housekeeping didn't show up until very late in the day and didn't refill the bathroom with necessary items several times.  We actually had to go to the lobby and get the items on our own twice.  Aside from housekeeping, service at the hotel was excellent.  The breakfast staff was very responsive and the front desk/concierge people were very friendly, very helpful and accommodating.  Breakfast itself was very nice each morning, although we would have liked to see some variety on the menu since we were there for 5 mornings.  Maybe at least a special dish each day on top of the regular menu?  All in all, we would definitely recommend Hotel Neri but suggest their housekeeping staff get  a little more on the ball.",4,2018,11,26
14,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"Our family of 5 (10 y.o., 12 y.o., 14 y.o.) stayed here for 4 nights and had an incredible stay.  The hotel is very charming and well-located, and the staff are amazing.  I would highly recommend staying here - one of my favorite all-time hotels!",5,2018,11,26
14,"Great Location, Awesome Food, Amazing Staff","We were treated to excellence in our two-night stay at Hotel Neri and can't say enough about everything at this hotel.  The location is perfect--easy walking to the Gothic Quarter, great shopping, lovely restaurants, and lots of sightseeing.  The reception on our arrival was warm, friendly, and most helpful.  We were offered coffee, water, sparkling water, and lovely little cookies, right in the front lobby.  You feel like you've stepped back in time and are in an old Spanish manor when you arrive.  Our room was ready and we were escorted (and helped with our luggage) by one of the front desk staff.  She stayed with us, explaining our room amenities, and making sure we had what we needed.  At one point, I needed to make a call to a hotel in Monaco due to an overcharge on our bill--the Hotel Neri staff placed the call for me and situated me in a private room for my call---wow, how great is that!!  They also made reservations for us at a marvelous restaurant (walking distance, local, genuine, perfect) and helped us with our driver on our last day's departure. One night we stopped in to the bar for a quick drink before dinner and sat at the bar.  The young lady bartender was just delightful, we had a wonderful conversation with her and learned about her background from Eastern Europe--again, super friendly, made us feel totally welcome.  There are two more amazing things I want to point out:  one is the breakfast.  It's in the hotel restaurant and is served on a long ceramic plate that includes assorted breads, yogurt, granola, fresh fruits, cheese, meats and salami, jams, honey, and butter.  And that is for EACH person!  On top of that, you can order from a menu that includes eggs to order, omelets, pancakes, and bacon.  It's a breakfast fit for royalty!!  And the server is SO very friendly as he brings freshly made coffee, orange juice, or whatever else you want to drink.  The other amazing thing is the service we received upon leaving.  We had a LOT of luggage, having been on a Med Cruise for 7 days prior to our stay in Barcelona.  We had to take the luggage to a driver that was about a 5-minute walk from the hotel, based on where he needed to park.  One of the Hotel Neri staff members insisted on helping us with our bags and walked all the way to the driver with our bags in tow, making sure we got everything safely transported for our trip to the airport.  This is exemplary service, top to bottom.  We highly, highly recommend this hotel and if we should return to Barcelona it is the ONLY hotel we would consider.  Thank you to the entire staff of Hotel Neri for a fabulous end to our European vacation!",5,2018,11,18
14,A Favorite!,"Hotel Neri is romantic, charming, wonderful, has truly the best location in the city and within the Gothic Quarter. I love the traditional exterior with modern interior. We were taken care of by the staff and there was not one thing that we felt could have been better. We had a lovely first and second stay! ",5,2018,11,12
14,"Hidden Gem, Smells Great","This hotel is hidden im Barrí Gotic, but is a great base of operations to explore the quarter and refresh yourself in the morning and at night. The breakfast was unreal in terms of quality and quantity of food. The room was comfortable, with good lighting and a tiny balcony that made us feel like locals. And everything in the hotel smells amazing.",5,2018,11,11
14,Perfect hotel in a perfect place,"We stay at the apartments, very convenient. Hotel itself is superb, relais standard, very professional and helpful staff, very nice food. Location the best you can imagine. No parking and no direct access for a taxi, so be aware you have to walk with your luggage some minutes or ask for a help. Anyway highly recommended. ",5,2018,11,10
14,Awesome Gem in the heart of the Barri Gotic,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here for 2 nights. It was an adventure finding the hotel that is tucked away in the alleys of the Barri Gòtic. Once inside you’re warmly greeted by their amazing staff. The main lobby is 18th century while the bar, restaurant are 12th century. The history is spectacular as was our room. We were upgraded to a junior suite, room 107 which had heigh ceilings that were original wood from the 18th century.
In the back is the church San Felip de Neri which was Gaudi ‘s favorite place to pray.
Thank you to the staff for making our stay so memorable.
I will recommend you for sure.
",5,2018,11,04
14,A treat!,"Was fortunate enough to get transferred, or shall we say significantly upgraded, from another hotel during a business trip. The Neri comes across as a luxurious and tranquil  haven, which is still right in the middle of the old town, a stone´s throw from major sites suc as La Boqueria, La Rambla, etc.  The service level is impeccable from the moment you enter, lobby, the restaurant and rooms are tastefully decorated. Breakfast is excellent, with great freshly baked bread, croissants, sliced fruits and an extensive breakfast a la carte menu. Theres also a dinner menu that I didn`t get to try. I really wish I could have spent more days here : The hotel and the whole experience is an absolute treat, and since we all deserve a bit of pampering from time to time, go for it if you have the chance ! I sure will the next time I`m around.",5,2018,10,31
14,"Pleasure and quiet in noisy,busy area.            pleasure, pure pleasure","The is a great find in bustling city.  The are rooms wonderful with pale colors that instantly help you relax. It’s quite romantic if theirs 2 of you, as well as very private .
The dinning room serves a wonderful breakfast, great lunches and dinners.  The service is the best I’ve had in years. Everyone assist you with your needs. They find private guides that really know history and have keys to locked sites. Once you walk in lobby you feel peace wash over you. The lobby are has many areas to relax and enjoy music that plays all day. As a solo traveler I feel very comfortable and safe here. Deserves 5 1/2 stars.

14,Heart of Barcelona ,"We recently visited this 5 star historic modern hotel in the center of the Barri Gotic for my wife's birthday and was an incredible experience made possible by the pleasant, friendly,  over the top staff. From the moment you walk in you feel like you are somewhere surrounded by rich history and culture.  The boutique hotel has a amazing restaurant with a view of a historic plaza where there is a church one visited daily by Antonio Gaudi who is a significant architect to Catolonia. Also, located on the top of the hotel was a neat little rooftop for watching the sun go down or enjoying a drink. The general manger Maria and her team Martha, Jacob, Veronica, Joaquin, rest of staff including restaurant personnel have went above and beyond to make this a one of a kind experience we will cherish forever. We are looking forward to our next time in Barcelona with our friends at the Hotel Neri.",5,2018,10,25
14,Home away from Home,"This gem in the Gothic Quarter was overall amazing - we give thanks and appreciation for the service and care we received at HOTEL NERI. It's also centrally located near the Ramblas and walking distance to the Cathedral. Its in a renovated 17th century palace which backs onto Placa Sant Felip Neri which has a fountain and a palm tree - also Dont forget to visit the roof-top with a glass of Cava to unwind from a day of sightseeing.It was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday and make new friends that I now call my family. It was absolutely perfect!And the staff, Martha, Jacopo and Veronica were amazing. Their recommendations of places to eat  and visit did not disappoint. The food in Barcelona was absolutely phenomenal!!! Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive and kind including the bar staff and housekeeping. We have already decided to return to the NERI for our next vacation, which will be next year.We had a wonderful time, and I have recommended HOTEL NERI to all of my colleagues, friends and family. Thank you again for such outstanding service and memories to last a lifetime!!",5,2018,10,24
14,"Hotel Neri, Barcelona","Beatiful small hotel in the Gothic Quarter.  Modern renovation of adjoining 12th & 18th century buildings, with all conveninces. Nice, quiet, relaxed, friendly hotel for people who want to be in a civilized environment.",5,2018,10,19
14,Rating Hotel Neri,"I enjoyed staying at Hotel Neri while we were in Barcelona. Only thing that was difficult was where the hotel is located. Because it is in the Gothic Quarter, taxis are unable to take you to/from the hotel-you must walk to the square to get a driver. And at nighttime, I did not feel safe as it was difficult to navigate through the quarter-all streets look the same! Hotel itself though was sweet and enjoyable.",5,2018,10,18
14,Fantastic location and service quality!,"The quiet Gothic quarter is an ideal base for exploring BCN.  Near the historic BCN Cathedral and easy walking distance to important art, architecture, local shopping and eateries.  The hotel staff are attentive and responsive and make you feel like family from the start.  The hotel restaurant, “a,” also is excellent and consistently delicious.  Creative dinner cuisine along with more familiar choices are available for breakfast.  You will be glad you chose this place if you go there.",5,2018,10,14
14,Nicest Hotel in Barcelona for sure,"Got to spend one night in this beautiful hotel with my boyfriend. We spent months in Barcelona and loved the Plaza were the Hotel is located and went here for dinner several times. 
Everything about this hotel is perfect. all the details, the lightening, the breakfast, the roomservice, the flowers on the rooftop, the quote in the elevator, the molton brown supplies. I could carry on like that forever. This restaurant has values And very hospitale people.",5,2018,10,10
14,Definitely one to consider!!,"Fantastic boutique hotel. Perfect location for immersing yourself in Catalunian culture, so much history. You leave a quiet hotel and immediately find yourself in the center of active urban life in the historical part of the city. Great service. All needs considered in the apartments. Highly recommended!",5,2018,10,07
14,Best Hotel I have ever stayed at.,"WOW, this hotel has everything.   The taxi stopped on the road then walked us though the busy narrow streets of the Gothic area.  Then we come across a glass door.  The minute we walk through we are in a different world.  The check in is small but beautifully furnished.  We are immediately offered a glass of local Cava, coffee or tea.  We are sat down on the lounge and checked in.  The staff then walk us to our room and show us where everything is and how everything works.   Our room was large with 20 foot ceilings separate bathroom with double vanity basins.    We had a glass door leading on to a small balcony.  Once the door was opened you heard the busy streets and noise of Barcelona.  Close the door and it was total quietness.   The location is a 50 meter walk to the Cathedral of Barcelona and a 5 minute walk to La Rambla.  Perfect location.   When you go to breakfast you are immediately asked for coffee and tea then handed a platter of fruit and meats.  This is first course.   You can then order eggs, omelettes and bacon.  Dinner, my suggestion is at 7pm they set tables out in Placa de Sant Filip Neri.  They only seat 20 people so first in gets the seats.   Watch the world go by in the plaza.  Food is local and great.   Last but not least.   The staff.  5 star hotels offer professional service.  Hotel Neri offers professional and personal service.  Every time we walked in we were greeted with a smile and conversation.  Every time we asked for help we felt like we were the only people in the room. They gave us 100% attention.   We have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is by far the best one we have ever stayed at.",5,2018,10,06
14,perfect property,"great experience for location, service and accommodations! highly recommend for immersing yourself in Barcelona. Transfers were professional. Hotel arranged the perfect guide for tour of sights, superior, with incredible knowledge and experience and personality.",5,2018,10,05
14,Lovely boutique hotel,Perfectly located in Barcelona’s Gothic old city with lovely amenities and service. A quiet oasis even durin the Merce festival! Adjoins a quiet plaza and nearly next door to the Barcelona catherdral. ,5,2018,09,29
14,Special,"Located in the old city with an accent Roman road right out front. Easy walk to many attractions. Restaurant just so so including many ""substitutions"" on the menu. The Relais & Chateaux website is beyond ridiculous for booking. Use Booking.com or another.",5,2018,09,06
14,Great Hotel and Staff,"We stayed in The Hotel Neri for 3 nights of our honeymoon and they were fantastic. The hotel is in the middle of Barcelona and you can walk to almost anything. The proximity to the Cathedral of Barcelona was great because it gave us a point of reference to our hotel. The staff of the Neri was exceptionally friendly and went out of the way for us. They offered umbrellas to all guests when it looked like it was going to rain. They are very knowledgeable about the surrounding area, we asked for things to do and places to eat and we were not disappointed in any of their recommendations. They had breakfast every morning and it was delicious. I highly recommend the hotel Neri to anyone visiting Barcelona. ",5,2018,09,04
14,Brilliant Neri,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Neri for four nights and I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in the Gothic Quarter.  
The apartment we stayed in was excellent with ample room and it was very quiet and peaceful.  
The breakfasts and dinner we had at the hotel restaurant were lovely and the setting is extremely pleasant. 
Most impressive were the staff. They were all very professional and attentive to our needs.  I needed to see a doctor during our stay and they arranged this so quickly and with great care. Before I knew it there was a doctor at my apartment to sort me out and I was clear to head out to dinner before I knew it!  
I’d happily go back to Hotel Neri again when in Barcelona. ",5,2018,08,30
14,"Great location,quiet, character by the bucketful. ","My beautiful wife and I stayed at this boutique hotel for a few days. The room was full of charm and character from an era of days gone bye.
The street view made for light entertainment in a very central location. Service was good as was the room size.
This hotel offers good value for money.
No dissapointments here.",4,2018,08,04
14,5 Star Room ,"Check in was one of the best experiences I have had at any hotel as it included champagne. Good start. We had a junior suite and it was phenomenal. Comfortable bed, clean and very spacious. The design of the shower was a bit tricky for non gymnasts or short people, but water was hot and at high pressure. The hotel location is bang in the middle of the Gothic area and it’s a very short walk to many of the main sites. Plenty of cafes and restaurants within a stones throw, which was useful as we opted to go to for breakfast outside as the Neri breakfast, despite being good, was very pricey for what it was. The rooftop bar was a bit of a let down, probably needs some re-thinking. Service at both the rooftop and cafe/bar downstairs would be great if you had a lot of patience and time. I would definitely recommend this hotel, amazing building, brilliant rooms and great location. ",4,2018,07,26
14,Luxury location for walking not cars but fun staying there,"We were in the hotel Neri twice, coming and going from Barcelona on our road trip. We chose it because it is one of the Relais et Chateaux that we have had good experience with, high quality and usually fairly upscale in price. Though we liked it, we found it a bit difficult to approach with our luggage because there is no way to get up to the hotel entry. It is in the old area, charming, well located, however the taxi had to leave us about 2 blocks away. The hotel staff were accommodating in helping with luggage to and from the taxi. 
Part of the building is an 11th century medieval mansion, renovated to create the hotel and restaurant.  It has a designer feeling to it, use of good quality modern materials, plastic furniture in bright colors mixed with LED accent lights and curious displays of tinsel “sacred hearts” displayed in cases. The concierge was very personable and helpful with reservations for a show. Check-in was easy, fast and friendly. The rooms were a good size for European hotels. The second time we stayed in a suite that had a sofa-bed and two twin beds so it was larger. They carried out the modern accents in use of directed spot lighting that, though beautifully done, caused me a bit of frustration in being able to see clearly. I find that low lighting can be soothing but you end up wasting time trying to find things quickly and seeing in the mirror. That room had windows giving out on the street behind so close that you can see the TV in the apartments next door so it was good they had curtains. I was glad for the black-out curtains that made it easy to sleep and it was quiet even though on the streets there was a constant parade of visitors until late. The rooms had a TV with lots of channels, a safe, minibar, robes and slippers, coffee maker, two faucets over an elongated sink, bathtub/shower combo. The service was good and fast. They serve breakfast in their attractive restaurant on the first floor (they have a bar on the top floor that we didn’t visit but heard was good) that has a view of the San Felipe Neri Church plaza. It offers a la carte, serving a variety of breakfast items and has a bread and cheese buffet on the side. I love Barcelona and this is certainly a wonderful choice for its location, comfort and service.

14,Gorgeous hotel in ideal location ,"This was our first time in Barcelona and we were amazed at how perfect this hotel was. The location is fantastic, right in the heart of the Gothic quarter. There are tons of cute shops and restaurants within walking distance. It’s quiet, renovated beautifully, and the service is spectacular. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern.  The breakfast was terrific.  Didn’t eat dinner there, but one night had drinks at rooftop bar which was fantastic.  Staff bent over backwards. For example, I left a pair of shorts and they offered to mail to me.  Every time we left the hotel they gave us directions and advice.  All told, would stay here again in a heartbeat!!!",5,2018,07,16
14,Wonderful Memories of a wonderful hotel.,"There isn't much you can say about this hotel, it is just perfect.  Wonderful location, incredible decor - loved the designer sofas and artwork.  

The staff are great and very helpful, the restaurants food and drink was amazing, sat in the courtyard and had coffee whilst we waited for the room to be ready - watched the world go by as people passed through.

Our room was a deluxe with terrace, very nice to sit our there and listen to the city hum with all the plants around.  A short walk up some stairs to the rooftop bar which was lit up at night and you can see the city lit up.

The room was very quiet and had blackout curtains so it was dark at night (some hotels still don't have these and it is hard to sleep with light in the room).

The staff arranged for a car to pick us up from the airport and take us back when leaving.   Interesting to see the driver get the car up to the hotel door as the streets are so narrow.

Am planning to return to Barcelona and will definitely stay here again, wonderful memories of a wonderful hotel. 

btw.  we visited this hotel in 2013 but due to family and personal health problems am now catching up with my reviews.",5,2018,07,13
14,Best of the Best,"The beauty of this hotel is only outdone by the friendliness & helpfulness of the entire staff. From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty. Jacopo, the front office manager, was wonderful & helpful & the hotel is lucky to have him! The location is perfect! You can walk anywhere in the city from the Neri Hotel. We usually stay at Four Season Hotels & the Neri Hotel is the same quality if not better!",5,2018,07,04
14,Amazing hotel,"The location is wonderful...in walking distance to the cathedral and many restaurants and shops. The Front office manager Jacopo was so helpful, even preparing coffee and sandwiches for our early morning flight out of Barcelona. And the rest of the staff was excellent, suggesting places to go and helping in any way they could. The breakfast is included and there is a cute outside courtyard for snacks and drinks. Even though my room was facing the courtyard, the noise could not be heard in my room. This couldn’t have been a better hotel!!",5,2018,07,02
14,Wonderful location & attention to detail ,"We had room 301 which had a glorious view into the tops of the trees in the courtyard beside the hotel. Anya in the restaurant looked after us wonderfully. Couldn’t recommend this hotel enough. Beautiful room, excellent location & wonderful service. ",5,2018,06,30
14,The Dordogne,"Relais & Chateaux in St. Crepin et Carlucet was a dream:  quiet, charming, beautiful, and comfortable.  The hosts - Gilles and Anouk - were friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat.  We absolutely loved it.",5,2018,06,28
14,Hidden gem in Gothic Quarter,"Stayed for a week. Simply outstanding and a memory of a lifetime. Exceeded all expectations. This Hotel oozed charm. Staff were absolutely wonderful and couldn't do enough for us. Thanks to Jacob and Anya especially for your advice, recommendations, assistance with bookings (and patience) during our stay. Each room is different. Our suite was spacious, eclectic and very comfortable. Highlights included drinks on the terrace watching the sunset with views over the rooftops and surrounded by flowers in full bloom, meals in Sant Felip Neri Square (when school had finished as children from the local school use it as a playground during the day) and dinners at the Hotel restaurant A. Note: the Hotel is located in a narrow street in the Gothic Quarter. Taxis may not drop you at the door. However, Hotel staff assisted our driver to carry our luggage to the hotel. Our pick-up managed to drive to the door of the hotel! Thank you Hotel Neri. I hope to return soon!",5,2018,06,22
14,Simply gorgeous in the heart of the Gothic Quarter ,"This is a very small, unique hotel, deep in the heart of the Gothic area of the city. It’s set in a narrow alley, and the closest a car could get to it was a nearby plaza - so be aware of this if you have mobility issues. The hotel itself was simply stunning- photos don’t really do its atmosphere justice. It backs onto a tiny plaza that houses a school and in the holiday period when the children aren’t there, it uses this area for al fresco dining. A real treat.",5,2018,06,05
14,Perfect setting to immerse oneself in Barcelona ,"Set right in the middle of Gothic Barcelona this hotel is a gem! The plaza behind the hotel has huge historical significance from the civil war, and the streets around the hotel are a maze of history and charm. We could walk to so many historical and tourist attractions from the hotel. We loved watching the children arrive at school in the plaza as we had breakfast - no car in sight - they all came on foot or scooter or bike! The hotel staff members were extremely helpful, efficient and friendly - we arrived early in the morning after a long trip from Australia and they managed to have our room ready by 10.30! Our room was spacious, set on the corner with balconies overlooking the lane ways - we could almost touch the washing hanging on our neighbours' balconies across the laneways! All part of inner city living and the local charm! The only negative about our room was that we were a bit nervous climbing in and out of the bath for our shower - a non slip mat and a hand rail on the wall would be most helpful. We enjoyed our delicious breakfasts (we stayed 6 nights) and our two evening meals - only one negative - the music was too loud in the evening at the restaurant! ",5,2018,05,27
14,Elegant stay in old Barcelona,"The perfect base from which to explore the many museums, restaurants and shops hiding in the narrow, winding streets of the old city around the Cathedral.  The hotel itself tends to hide in one of those historic buildings, elegantly renovated to combine all the modern conveniences without losing the charm.  Be sure to check out the classical music ",5,2018,05,23
14,History and Character in the midst of the Gothic Quarter,"My children and I just loved this hidden gem that oozes with history and character in the midst of the Gothic quarter.  The breakfast was delightful, the accommodations were lovely and the service and the location could not have been better.  We loved wandering the streets of Barcelona in this area and can't wait to return.",5,2018,05,16
14,An absolute treasure,"Hotel Neri is nestled in a quiet little street in the old town with lots of beautiful little shops and restaurants within a seconds walk .. although just a few minutes to La Rambla, the famous ""La Boqueria"" market, and all the beautiful Gaudi and other stunning sights of the city it also enjoys a little privacy in a quiet and secure location.
As you walk in the main reception you are greeted by friendly and helpful staff and the elegant scent of their signature candles.
The rooms are beautiful and furthermore they now even have fabulous little one bedroom apartments perfectly appointed and especially good for 2 adults and 2 small children or for slightly bigger families you could perhaps book 2 appartments side by side ... they come  with all the comforts of home such as espresso machine, washing machine dishwasher etc but are literally just 2 seconds across from the hotel and its bijou but fabulous restaurant.  
As for the food, well lets just say in my opinion the chef really is a gift from heaven.  Not only is the food cooked to perfection, and beautifully presented butthe taste is exquisite ... if you want a really special breakfast then this little place really is a slice of heaven and worth every penny.
The staff are also really lovely, helpful and professional.
The only thing i would recommend is that if possible you prebook a transfer with the hotel directly as it is in a quiet street not all taxis will know well and given its central location in a tiny cobbled alley on a busy day the driver may need to drop you in a street beside it ... nevertheless staff at the hotel will help arrange the best option and also be on hand to assist with your luggage.
I've always loved Barcelona but after discovering this little treasure i love it even more.",5,2018,05,05
14,Flawless from start to finish,"Hotel Neri is a stunningly designed, and beautifully discreet hotel in the Gothic Quarter. The service is exceptional, attentive but never stuffy, the rooms are tastefully decorated, quiet and comfortable and the food is superb (the coconut and lime tacos are a must!). ",5,2018,05,01
14,Would definitely stay there again!,"We stayed at Hotel Neri in April, 2018.  We are a family of three...husband, wife and 17 year old daughter.  We had a junior suite on the fourth floor overlooking the school yard and courtyard.  Our room was very comfortable, quite, and roomy.  The bathroom was well equipped with a walk in shower and separate tub.  There was a farm style sink with two faucets which was great!  We did not have a balcony but did have large windows which opened to the courtyard.  We opted for the breakfast each morning which was delicious and plentiful.  The staff was excellent and the location was perfect.  We were in walking distance of many attractions and delicious dining, plus close to the metro.  We enjoyed staying in a smaller hotel in the heart of the gothic quarter.  We would definitely stay at Hotel Neri again!",5,2018,04,29
14,A jewel,"The setting of the hotel in the Gothic Quarter took us back to the 12th century but with all the conveniences of today. Definitely a 5 star experience. The rooms were beautifully appointed and the views spectacular. Breakfast was lovely and the management and staff were so attentive and well trained.
Although the property is located on a pedestrian street, management makes a taxi available. We loved it.",5,2018,04,17
14,"Great Hotel but beware its on a pedestrian only street, might not be best for families with small kids","Good Location old world charm In the heart of old Barcelona next to the cathedral and the city hall etc. The Hotel is beautiful but we were not aware that no cars can drive upto the front door.  Our taxi left us a 5 min walk away from the hotel. With 3 big bags, many small ones, 1 stroller and 2 kids it wasnt the most convenient to get there. Maybe its our fault that we didnt read well about it but everyone with kids should be aware just in case you have small kids and its hard to walk with a lot of stuff. We stayed in one of the residences across the hotel and the apartment was fine and had all the amenities.",4,2018,04,08
14,"Wonderful hotel in Barri Gòtic - small, intimate setting, great service","We stayed at Hotel Neri on the recommendation of world traveler friends who always look for Relais & Chateaux properties around the world. Now we understand why. This lovely hotel is set in a historical, medieval palace from the XII century right in the center of Barri Gòtic (Gothic quarter).  It is the perfect home base from which to explore Barcelona. The hotel is beautifully appointed, chic yet warm and inviting. The rooms are small but spa-like and cozy. The staff are helpful, friendly and welcoming every time you enter the hotel or restaurant. The restaurant is wonderful - we had breakfast there daily, cocktails and dinner once. Breakfast is so delicious, not to be missed (our hostess/server Claudia was charming and helpful). The concierge teams were exceptional. We will return to Hotel Neri on our next trip to Barcelona, and recommend it highly.",5,2018,04,07
14,Excellent hotel,The rooms are modern and beautiful decorated. The hotel is located in a very interesting quarter. The Picasso museum is near. The breakfast was very tasty and they offered a great selection. Highly recommended!,5,2018,03,26
14,"Service, comfort,convenience",Modern interiors in a historic building. Stylish bedroom.Good service and breakfasts.very well located in historic gothic quarter close to cathedral and Picasso museum. front of house staff particularly helpful.,5,2018,03,25
14,Excellent in all respects.,The service of all staff was professional but friendly. We had been emailed at booking time to offer a selection of linen and pillow type. All was ready as requested. Located in quiet part of Gothic quarter but within easy walk of Las Ramblas. We hope to return soon.,5,2018,03,18
14,Beware of Booking this Hotel,"While in Barcelona, we stopped in to book this hotel, in person, for a return visit the following weekend. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, we had to return to the States. We called to cancel the reservation the following morning, and were told that the hotel’s 7-day “cancellation policy,” which was not disclosed to us, would not allow us to do so (the policy was applied to mean that the room was non-cancellable at the moment it was made, something they should have told us). After several days of back and forth with rigid and unpleasant staff, we were still charged 50% of the rate on an expensive room we couldn’t use. Do business with these people at your peril.",1,2018,03,17
14,Wonderful stay,The staff at the Hotel Neri were great!  They were exceptionally considerate of mdietary restrictions. ( brought gluten free bread every day without our asking for it) The food was excellent. The people at the front desk were very helpful and nice. They took care of our plans and made all of our reservations for us. The hotel is small and made us feel like family. Always a smile and hello. We had a junior suite which was large and comfortable. The neighborhood was fun in walk in. We would definitely go back.,5,2018,03,13
14,A wonderful hotel in a wonderful city. ,"My wife and I visited Barcelona for the first time. We loved the Hotel Neri—it’s location (in the heart of the Gothic Quarter), the room (a very nice suite), the service (the staff was first rate) and, did I say, the location? I can’t imagine a better place to stay.",5,2018,03,09
14,Charming Luxury in the middle of old Barcelona,"Looking for a charming hide-away you may find this place the place to be. In the middle of the ancient gothic quarter, surrounded by historic buildings you find this hotel surrounded by narrow lanes and streets.
The interior is very well designed and welcoming, as are the rooms. Decent luxury for a relaxed stay with only a few rooms.",5,2018,03,06
14,Best hotel in Barcelona!,"We have been coming to Barcelona for many years and for the past 9 straight years we have been staying at the Hotel Neri.  The reasons are simple:  (1) the staff is wonderful -- helpful and always concerned for your comfort and making sure that your stay is perfect; (2) the location in the old part of the city is magical -- you feel transported back in time, surrounded by interesting shops, delicious restaurants, and historically interesting sights; (3) the restaurant is first rate with tasty breakfasts and extraordinarily dinners (the bar makes first rate cocktails too); and (4) they have installed new windows that keep the sounds of the city out while allowing you to have a restful sleep. It is our home away from home when we are in Barcelona.",5,2018,03,02
14,Loved this hotel,The location was central to the Gothic area of the city and it was easy to walk around and get a feel for the history and beauty of Barcelona.  The hotel itself was beautiful with excellent service.  Staff was friendly and the restaurant was very good.  I would definitely stay here again.,5,2018,02,28
14,Amaxing,This property was first class from top to bottom.  We stayed with our two daughters in connected rooms.  Excellent quiet location in the best part of the city!  I wish I could give it more than a 5 star rating.,5,2018,02,26
14,Great location in the heart of the gothic district - lovely apartment,"Stayed at the  newly opened apartment suites with a functional kitchen and separate entrance.  Kids loved being in the heart of everything with lots of shops, restaurants and alleyways to get lost in.  Room was a good size and quiet.",5,2018,02,10
14,"Great hotel for a romantic weekend, classy and beautifully located","Amazing hotel, in an excellent location. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful (reception, booking restaurants, suggestions of places to visit). Rooms are elegant and functional. Went on a romantic weekend with my wife, this was great.",5,2018,02,09
14,Another Relais & Chateaux Gem,"Spent five nights in January at historic and lovely Hotel Neri (British Airways Holiday package).  Everything was fabulous - location just a few steps from Cathedral's cloister entrance, but on a quiet, narrow street.  All the staff was informative, helpful and friendly.  Hotel Neri is a wonderful way to experience Barcelona.  Took day train trip to Girona which I strongly recommend.",5,2018,01,15
14,Perfection,"Not only is this hotel in the perfect location for visiting Barcelona, it cannot be faulted in any way.  I was very surprised to read poor reviews in relation to the staff as our experience was totally the opposite, and although we know one of the front of house staff was an intern she was so professional, helpful and charming she would be an asset in any establishment.  This attitude prevailed across our whole visit, and I haven't even got to the hotel side yet!  Stunning hotel, decor and rooms, and the food in the 'a' restaurant sublime.  Will be the only hotel we would consider on any return trip.",5,2018,01,14
14,"A perfect piece of history, hospitality and elegance","I can say nothing but good things about the fabulous Hotel Neri. Crossing the threshold from the centuries old streets in the Gothic quarter into a candle lit lobby of this12th century medieval mansion is nothing short of enchanting. The warm and welcoming hospitality from Jacopeo Bulgarelli and the always helpful staff never faded throughout our 10-day stay.
The guestroom and private patio were well appointed, beautifully furnished and romantically echoed the sound of Barcelona's many church bells.
The hotel is centrally located, just far enough from Las Ramblas to be peaceful yet close enough to walk everywhere. When asked, the staff provided expert tour advice for both self-guided and private tours.
The cozy bar and garden seating in the courtyard are the perfect spot for a Cava to end the day.
I would recommend this property with 10 stars if I could!",5,2018,01,03
14,Very good Hotel Neri Apartment,"We stayed in one of the six apartments owned by Hotel Neri (it's 2 minutes walk down the street).  Our check in at the hotel was very professional and we were given a welcome drink of delicious sangria.  We were then shown to the apartment and everything was explained fully to us by the friendly staff member.
The apartment was very good- 
•	Great location in old quarter so easy to walk to most things
•	Relatively quiet, especially with double glazed windows
•	Good bath products (Molton Brown conditioner, shampoo, gel)
•	Very friendly staff and good explanation of area and dinner recommendation
•	Voucher for free bottle of wine when dining in the restaurant (see separate review)
•	Good lighting
•	Had a washing machine and dishwasher 

A couple of issues however were:
•	Shower head arm is too short so have to lean into wall to shower
•	Shower base is very slippery
•	No shower cap or other toiletries provided (apart from bath products)
•	Sofa bed uncomfortable (had to use 3 doonas to make it soft enough)
•	TV no English stations apart from finance station
•	TV very low on floor so you couldn’t relax and watch it.
•	Bath products not replenished during 3 night stay.

Overall though we were very happy with the hotel and would certainly stay again.",5,2018,01,02
14,Truly special,"Incredibly beautiful unique building. Staff was warm and always helpful and kind. They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. The food was delicious. Our room was fantastic with high ceilings and an amazing stone bathroom. Highly recommend !!!

",5,2017,12,27
14,Fantastic Hotel in the Gothic Quarter!,"The Hotel Neri is a wonderful, charming hotel located in the
Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.  I like to try Relais & Chateaux properties
in different cities and was very impressed with the Neri.  I was traveling
in Europe with my daughter, on our way to drop her off for a semester
abroad in France.  Our room was very clean with beautiful accessories.
The outside patio was very private and contained an elevated bath tub,
which my daughter loved.  Service at the hotel is first rate and the staff
is very friendly and eager to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. 
The breakfast was awesome, although we did not try the dinner.  You can
just walk out the front door and enjoy the Gothic Quarter.  Also easy to get
transportation to any other part of town, but many wonderful locations
are within easy walking distance.  Very highly recommended!",5,2017,12,19
14,"The hotel, the food, the staff..5 stars. 😎","Want to go back a few centuries in luxury, and kindness? 

Hotel Neri is it. 

Set in Barcelona's Gothic quarter, this beautifully refurbished 12th century medieval palace has wonderful rooms, fabulous food and mystic charm. 

A great base to take on different parts of the city each day and return back to comfort and style. ",5,2017,12,09
14,One of the best experiences ever!,"This hotel is very small but very charming! The staff is simply the best my husband and I have ever experienced. They were helpful in every way possible. Every spot they recommended to eat at was beyond wonderful and not very expensive. They could not do enough for us. Their directions were great. They booked transfers for us to the airport and the driver was great.  Our room was spot on very comfortable. Just simply a wonderful experience ! We highly recommend this hotel if you are looking to be pampered. It is in the beautiful Gothic Quarter so you need to realize the buildings are close together, so yes you could look into another building or choose not too, or say hi and have a experience. The food was good, but the real winner here is the staff! We did not want to leave. Great location within walking distance to everything!",5,2017,11,28
14,Nice Boutique Hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"The Hotel Neri is a wonderful boutique hotel in the center of the “Gothic Quarter” of Barcelona. It was created from two castles built in the 18th century. It is a great location for a base of operations from which to tour Barcelona. There are great boutique shops there and the Born section of town closer to the marina. 

We were upgraded to one of the two best rooms in the hotel.  There were three 10-foot French doors with two small balconies overlooking the oldest section of town. As the hotel is located at the confluence of two alleys, it is a bit noisy. Unfortunately there was construction across the way and there was quite a bit of banging in the morning. Frankly, the hotel should have warned us of this.

The staff of the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The beds, pillows and towels were plentiful and very comfortable. We had complimentary water replaced in the mini refrigerator each night. The bathroom was well-appointed. The tub was large. The only problem there was that there was a channel between the tub and the short glass wall. During showers, water exited the channel onto the floor causing a huge puddle. We solved that problem by putting a washcloth in the channel. No big deal. The sink was a large channel with two faucets. The water was instantly very hot and plentiful.

Keep in mind that you can ask the hotel to call you a cab. Amazingly, a small taxi can navigate the alleyways to get to the hotel, but there are many people walking there as well. So it’s much easier to walk to the square in front of the cathedral to hail a cab.

We enjoyed a delicious meal at the hotel restaurant. It was tapas on steroids. Each plate was unique and delicious. As there were 6 of us, we got to sample most plates on the menu and compared to the surrounding tapas bars which are legion in Barcelona, the flavors were far superior those nearby.

The major downfall of this hotel was the bar. As we are retired and visit Relais&châteaux properties frequently, it was a surprise to see a Relais pin on a gentleman wearing a Polo shirt. The bar selection was weak to say the least. Our complimentary vermouth and snack consisted of simply some average, everyday vermouth in a glass. We were told there would be a charcuterie plate to accompany our drinks. That became unavailable. The bar man then told us that there would be mussels. Those turned out to be unavailable. We were then asked for a tip. Tacky.",4,2017,11,23
14,Luxury in the Gothic Quarter,Located beside an historic square the Hotel Neri is an absolute delight. Situated as it is along one of the many tiny lanes of the Gothic Quarter it could be a challenge to find to the uninitiated. Fortunately we chose to have the hotel arrange our transfer from the airport. Experiencing the driver maneuver his Mercedes down the pedestrian lane was entertaining in itself - after what had to have been a 20 point turn he proudly deposited us right outside the entrance. We were warmly welcomed and an efficient check in and orientation followed. Throughout our stay the staff were friendly and eager to ensure that we made the most of our time in Barcelona.  Our room was spacious and comfortable and looked out over the small historic square with a large tree and neighborhood school. As some reviewers have pointed out sounds of children playing made it a little noisy on school days but you would have to be sleeping in very late to be bothered. We ate one evening at the hotel restaurant and found that to be a pleasant experience.,5,2017,11,19
14,Quiet Boutique Luxury Set in the Charming Streets of the Gothic Quarter,"The beautiful Hotel Neri is located on one of the tiny alleyways of the Gothic quarter, just a short walk from Jaume Square (home of the Barcelona government, I believe).  The lobby is a medieval wonder, warm and inviting, and the modern rooms are large and luxurious.  The Neri has a beautiful rooftop bar, and the restaurant is first class.  We celebrated my wife's birthday at the Neri restaurant with a large group of friends.  The restaurant spills out into a beautiful courtyard.  The hotel is small, and we quickly felt like we knew most of the staff.  The staff was friendly and very efficient - they helped our friends retrieve luggage delayed by an airline, and they helped us set up a variety of dinners and excursions.  Their restaurant recommendations were among the best places we ate the entire trip.

The Neri's Gothic Quarter neighborhood is also the perfect location for Barcelona adventures - right in the midst of shopping and restaurants, and just steps from La Rambla, the Cathedral, the Born district, the Museo Picasso, etc.  The only minor problem is leaving a trail of bread crumbs to find your way back through the winding medieval streets to the hotel.  (It was very fun wandering and we quickly figured it out.) 

We loved, loved, loved our room.  It was roomy and comfortable and looked out over a charming courtyard with a large tree and neighborhood school.  The school made it a little noisy if you tried to sleep in (very late) on school days, but this was a small price to pay.

We will definitely stay here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2017,11,08
14,First Class Barcelona hospitality,"First Class Barcelona hospitality.   Excellent service.  Rooms are located around historic courtyard.  Food was fresh, innovative and local.  Bar and rooftop patio were a great location to meet friends and enjoy a quiet drink.",5,2017,11,07
14,beautiful boutique hotel in the Gothic area,"Hotel Neri is located in two historical structures next to the Cathedral in the heart of the Gothic district and within easy walking distance of many of Barcelona's ""must see"" sights.  We had a wonderful corner junior suite which was large, comfortable and beautifully appointed.  Located on two narrow streets, privacy is not an option as the neighboring buildings are very close, but hey, that's what drapes are for.  And I can't say enough good things about the staff: the reception staff (and Gemma Bonner was exceptional) was available 24/7 (they have to buzz you in each time).  With only 22 rooms, typically there was only one person at the desk that did it all: check in, check out, information, restaurant queries and reservations (i.e., all concierge services), but they were extremely helpful, friendly and well informed.  The breakfast meals were very nice – perfect for us – with friendly and efficient staff … but if you like cruise-like meals, you may find it smallish.  I also liked the late hours (serving until 11:00) since we would often stay up late.  Dinner at the restaurant was very pleasant - dining outside on the square was quiet and comfortable.  The roof top terrace is perhaps a little oversold on their literature; it's nice, but really not much of a view ... the building is not that tall, but a very relaxing spot to enjoy the night air with an after dinner drink.  ",5,2017,11,02
14,Great location in Barcelona,"This is a beautiful small hotel in the Gothic quarter.  We enjoyed the restaurant and bar!!  A short walk gets you to La Rambla.  The room was not huge, but was nicely appointed!  There is no concierge, but wasn't a problem for us as this trip was 3rd visit there.  While out and about visiting the city, my husband had his wallet/passport stolen (on a Friday evening).  We were supposed to fly out the next Monday morning, but couldn't because to had to go to the US Consulate's office Monday morning (not open on the weekend).  The staff at the front desk were so very helpful.  They directed us to the Police Station (you have to have a police report before going to Consulate), then directed us to a place to get a passport photo taken, and then made sure we found the Consulate's Office.  They also worked with us by suggesting we just freeze our credit card, not cancel it.  Then, when we were ready to check out, we unfroze the card, used it and then froze it again.  We certainly appreciated all the assistance.  This was back in April of 2012.",5,2017,10,31
14,Hotel Neri,"Awesome location,get the rooms with the terrace.  No concierge on property, front desk is a all in one service,bags, door opening,etc. we used the rooftop area to make a picnic one early evening,wine,cheese,ham,bread, etc. ",4,2017,10,30
14,Good stay overall,"A bit disappointed in service but nice room, very clean, good location.  Had just gone to Madrid for 3 nights where staff was 100% on the ball.  Huge difference.  Travelled with another couple so had a great time.  Not sure I’d come back to Neri.  ",4,2017,10,29
14,A lot of appeal - but some maturity regarding the service yet to come,"This hotel is located in a terrific position in the Gothic quarter.  It is a quirky, modernized old world charm about it.  The rooms are minimal (perhaps just a touch too minimal).  The breakfast in the restaurant very flavoursome.  But there is some maturing with service delivery required.  It often felt like the hotel had only just opened and everyone staff member was new.  There was an awkwardness to much of the service delivery.  This was not to do with attitude but more to do with logistics and mechanics.",4,2017,10,27
14,Hotel Neri,"We spent 4 days at the Hotel Neri.  The Staff was wonderful, the room was excellent, and the location could not have been better.  

I recommend reading up on the places around the Hotel Neri as there are many special places that are near the hotel.",5,2017,10,26
14,Another excellent review,"It's an R&C so it's almost guaranteed to be very good. We did not run into any of the issues like poor service that some reviewers received. The front desk only had one staff at 4am, otherwise there were two to three with one of them typically behind the curtain. When we made our transport reservation for 4:30am (bleeping AF schedule) the front desk arranged for coffee, yogurt and fruit for 4am even though room service is not available til the croissants arrive at 7am. 

We were in 306 which does have a balcony and the outdoor shower was awesome (and screened from the neighbor's). 

I don't know what you'd want for breakfast that wasn't included. The local map with points of interest and especially recommended restaurants was VERY helpful. 

Yes, the bathroom needs more light for shaving and applying cosmetics. The AC is a bit high speed. The roof top is a bit ""clubhouse"" but private and room service is available if the bartender isn't on duty. The courtyard becomes magical later in the night for al fresco dining. The pockmarks in the church wall are either from an Italian bomb during the Civil War or a machine gun, I overhead tour guides give differing explanations. 

The hotel staff won us over when we arrived during the recent protests after dragging our luggage a mile over cobblestones at 85F. The hotel is correct, lots of cab drivers can't find the place so print off their map or use their service. We were coming from two miles away so tried our luck and the 6,000 police were all the excuse the cabby needed to drop us short. But when we stumbled in, they sat us down on a sofa with a glass of cava, eventually asked for our passports and then when we finished the cava asked if it was OK for them to show us our room. 

You couldn't be any closer to the Catedral and the Roman ruins. Loved being on a street with no vehicle traffic and with so many good restaurants nearby.",5,2017,10,24
14,Great Hotel,This is a great hotel.  Right in the Gothic district.  Large rooms and great service.  Within Walking distance to all the major areas to see in Barcelona.  Small hotel with great service.  The restaurant on site is also very good.,5,2017,10,23
14,Wonderful Hotel in a great location!,"Wonderful Hotel!  Excellent service and a super location!  Right in the middle of the Historic area of Barcelona and a quick walk to Las Ramblas.  Nice quiet location but close to all of the key spots in this fun city!

Expensive but worth it!  Cheers!",5,2017,10,21
14,Extraordinary!,"From the moment we arrived until our (reluctant) departure we were thrilled with the ambience, the service, the comfort and the charm of the Hotel Neri.  We will return to Barcelona just so that we can revisit.  It is beautifully located in the Gothic Quarter, but it is easy to reach all of the highlights of the city while being in the center of the old city.  We love the winding streets and hidden courtyards that we found and shopping was ideal.  An easy stroll then Metro ride gets you to the major Gaudi sites.  A brief walk brings you to Las Ramblas and the 'action"" if you wish.  But it is hard to leave the Neri, with its fantastic restaurant (we had breakfasts, a lunch and a dinner there).  Our room had a large terrace with a tub.  The terrace was quiet and inviting.The staff were all extremely helpful, even going outside of the hotel to show us the way to get somewhere.  We hired a car service thorough the hotel to and from the airport and they were very efficient in getting us to and from the hotel, which can be difficult to reach as there are no cars allowed down the street.  all in all it was an amazing experience to be at the Hotel Neri -- our three days there was the end of a 17 day vacation--it was a wonderful way to end.

14,Great boutique hotel!,"Perfect location, friendly and very helpful staff, great size rooms and amazing decor/architecture.  The restaurant and bar in the hotel is great to hang in for a small bite and a glass of wine between outings.  The staff gave us and friends we were traveling with excellent suggestions for restaurants and not just the usual tourist ones.  Will definitely stay again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2017,10,17
14,Fantastic Hotel - A hidden Gem ,"The Hotel Neri is a privatly owned hidden pearl in the best area in the Gothic. Only 22 personal rooms, quiet, luxorius and large. The Hotel also has small apartment building across the street, also very nice-somewhat more modern. The best and most personal service we have experienced on our travels- Thanks to fantastic staff, both Reception, nightmanager, Breakfast and bar!
We would love to visit you again! Expensive Hotel, but worth it if you Are lokking for something special!",5,2017,10,17
14,A stunning hotel in every way,"This hotel is perfection.  We stayed here with a family of five and had to take two rooms side by side.  The breakfast on the rooftop is delightful and the food delicious.  The location of the hotel is amazing and it was a delight to walk through the winding cobblestone streets of the Gothic quarter daily as we explored Barcelona.  A real highlight for us was sitting in the courtyard of San Felipe Neri for dinner. Our girls loved the open space to play in whilst we sat peacefully and relaxed, listening to the live music from the acoustic musicians wandering in and out.  It is a very special hotel and we would stay there again in a heartbeat.  Oh, the daily chocolate chip cookies in the lobby were a hot with children and adults alike!",5,2017,10,17
14,Beautiful boutique hotel in heart of Gothic quarter,"The Hotel Neri had come highly recommended to me and I absolutely understand why.  The staff, room amenities and facilities and the restaurant/bar and other public areas were first rate.  The hotel has combined old world charm with all modern conveniences making the visit very special.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2017,10,10
14,Beautiful Hotel in the Gothic Quarter,The property is beautiful and the staff go above and beyond to make your stay special!  The rooms are spacious and well appointed. This lovely old building has great updates but still has  kept the old world charm. ,5,2017,10,09
14,A Special Hotel in Barcelona,"This was our second trip to Barcelona and our only regret was that we didn’t stay at the Hotel Neri on our first trip.  If you can splurge, this is a great choice!

The location in the Bari Gotic is terrific.  It was especially interesting because we were there during the celebration of San Merce and its fascinating parades.

Although the location is great, it is outdone by its staff;  they were welcoming, fun, detail-oriented, and informative.   

  We were traveling with other family members; an extra nice touch was that all of our rooms were ready for our separate arrivals.  The rooms are lovely and the art in the hotel is special.  Our suite had a balcony with a jacuzzi, outdoor shower and places to sit.",5,2017,10,08
14,"Charming, perfectly located boutique hotel","Everything you would expect from a relais hotel. Characterful period building nestling in the heart of the old quarter balanced with a contemporary, quirky interior and high standard accommodation. Staff are attentive, cute bar/restaurant fronting a delightful enclosed square. We only stayed one night but enjoyed every minute of our stay, including breakfast!",5,2017,10,07
14,Beautiful small Hotel,This hotel is in historic old town. It is in the middle of everything and very well ran. The staff is wonderful and polite with a willingness to help with every need. The breakfast they serve is delicious. So when you need to book a boutique hotel in Barcelona this would be one to try. Youwill not be disappointed. ,5,2017,10,04
14,beautiful little hotel in Gothic quarter,"Charming hotel in a perfect central Gothic quarter location with friendly service. The only negative was that room was a little small and dark. Everything else was great quality-service, cleanliness, esthetics, quiet. Recommend the option for breakfast as quality was very good. We had a great dinner at the hotel restaurant too. Would definitely return-love this place.",5,2017,10,02
14,Outstanding Experience in Beautiful Barcelona,"From the moment we checked in to the moment we left the gracious staff were accommodating in every way–patiently giving directions, recommending best tapas bars, and accommodating our every request. Our room was very comfortable with fine amenities. The hotel's location in the Gothic Quarter was a real bonus.",5,2017,09,30
14,Lovely Hotel Neri,"A great hotel, we had two very nice rooms with private balconies. Such a wonderful staff and management. The concierge staff assisted me with special requests above and beyond the norm. The dining room and bar staff were very accommodating. A very nice location and generally everything you would hope for from a small luxury boutique hotel.",5,2017,09,29
14,For the detail oriented traveller,"I am glad i chose hotel neri. The staff were really attentive to every small detail. It does not hurt that they are in the heart of the gothic quarter. The breakfast is of high caliber. They made great restaurant reservations which helped as i had many friends travelling to barcelona at that time. 

One small suggestion: Train your staff to be attentive to single travellers. I waited 15 mins to be served coffee in the am at the bar location.",5,2017,09,28
14,Felt like royalty,We were so lucky to have stayed here for our first trip to Barcelona and it was a first class stay!  The service was amazing and they thought of everything from excellent restaurant recommendations to beach bags and towels!  The beds were amazing and the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly.  Our room was kept spotless and anything we asked for or needed was there in minutes.  The location is perfect in the heart of where everything happens in Barcelona yet the Hotel Neri was a peaceful oasis to relax when we finished exploring this beautiful city. The meals were amazing with enough variety keep everyone happy and plenty to start your daily adventure.  The staff was always smiling and ready to help with anything you forgot or to help you schedule any type of reservation or trip.  We can't wait to return to Hotel Neri and cannot thank them enough for such great memories of our trip to Barcelona❤️❤️,5,2017,09,26
14,Very nice boutique hotel,"Hotel Neri delivers on the concept of a truly boutique hotel. It is located down a warren of narrow streets in the heart of Barcelona’s Gothic section. It is housed in an old mid evil building that has been beautifully  renovated and it is decorated with quirky, very Barcelona, furnishings. It is right in the heart of the old city, in the center of everything.
Our only complaint was that it was noisy. There is a school located in an adjacent building and we could hear children playing all day and people in the courtyard much of the night. I think a different room (we were in 101), possibly located on a higher floor would alleviate that issue. Very nice, very hospitable people.",4,2017,09,23
14,"great visit to Barcelona, Spain","The Neri Hotel is a wonderful boutique hotel in a great location for all the sights.  A 12th century building, it has been tastefully modernized.  Our room was spacious, the terrace outfitted with a jacuzzi tub and shower and the suite well appointed.  The breakfast was plentiful and delicious.  The staff were helpful and very professional.",5,2017,09,21
14,Ms,"Lovely!!  Exceeded expectations. Wonderful location, wonderful staff - Jacapo, Gilan and Jenna were so helpful and gracious to meet our every need.  A true find!!
We could not be happier with our hotel selection!",4,2017,09,21
14,"Less of a hotel, more of an experience","Hotel Neri is everything you could ask for and more. My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights as the last stop of our three week trip. We arrived around 6pm, exhausted and sweaty. The hotel front desk had us sit down on a couch and brought over cold beers as a welcome drink. We didn't even have to get up to check in. He let us relax on the couch and just brought over the room key and receipt to sign when it was done. 

The room is beautifully designed. We were upgraded to a deluxe room due to booking through Chase Luxury Hotel Collection and we were thoroughly pleased. The shower/bath combination is perfect, with a well lit mirror and large sink space. The room had mood lighting that you could control right from your bedside. The comforter was just right for the hot weather. Anything that we needed through our stay, the hotel staff was right there. Don't be shy about asking them for help and recommendations as they are extremely attentive.

We had dinner outside at the hotel's restaurant the first night. They provided sausage and bread on the house as a starter which we really enjoyed. The lobster rice is amazing along with the turbot that my boyfriend had. There also was a local man singing and playing guitar as we dined. We highly recommend the entire experience. This is a real five star hotel and one of our new favorites around the world. 

Ps. Don't miss out on drinks on the terrace! It is beautiful, especially at night.",5,2017,09,21
14,Quiet and centrally located,Hotel Neri is a great place to stay and be able to walk to most sites.  The hotel is situtated in the beautiful Placa De Sant Felip Neri square that is quite lovely after the tourists are gone.  The breakfast is good but could use some variation from day to day. The property is well maintained and the staff is friendly and helpful.,5,2017,09,10
14,Three day trip,"Lovely old gothic palace, very friendly staff,nothing was too much trouble. We had a large room with wrap around terrace,sun loungers lemon trees and a BATH!! With flats next door I wasn't brave enough. Breakfast was good but the restaurant in the evening on our last night as we had to leave very early was to die for, we had lobster to start with turbot and suckling pig as main courses.",5,2017,09,10
14,Return trip as good as ever,"This time I was able to return with my wife and we were not disappointed. The room on this occasion had been upgraded to include a small private balcony (although beware neighbouring apartment buildings with flat roofs that can be viewed from - as my wife discovered from the outside bath). The room itself was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Wonderfully decorated as before. The upstairs bar is very restful and we enjoyed a drink and simple meal the first evening we arrived. Breakfast was very good with fresh cold meats and breads brought on a platter and then the ability to order additional cooked food from a limited menu.Everything very well prepared. 
Service could not be faulted at any stage. This is an expensive hotel but it does deliver to a very high standard.",5,2017,09,09
14,perfect honeymoon,"Beautiful hotel in the old part of the city , very cool and chil with a great courtyard attached perfect service with a nice bottle of champagne on the first night.  Cool hotel bar , staff were friendly and helpful  will return,",5,2017,09,06
14,Fantastic stay,"We stayed at the Neri for six nights.  Large, beautiful room overlooking the courtyard.  The breakfast is included with your stay and is excellent.  The coffee is nice and strong.  The hotel is situated right in the Gothic neighborhood and is super safe to walk around all hours.  The hotel staff, concierge, front desk were so helpful and friendly.  Loved our stay.  Will return for sure.",5,2017,09,04
14,Exquisite hotel. Perfect Location. ,"Luv this place. A historic palacio in a quiet street overlooking a quiet square where we has breakfast as well as in the beautiful restaurant. Elegant public space and our room too. A suite with an outdoor terrace, reclining chairs and a bathtub. Excellent service. But the best was walking around the Gothic quarter right out the door with wonderful old streets, churches, music and even quiet places to sit. In the morning. To late in the evening. The best location!! ",5,2017,09,04
14,Hotel Neri is Awesome!,"If you want to be right in middle of the Gothic Quarter, on a quiet alley next to the Cathedral, in a 22-room palace from the 12th Century ... Hotel Neri is the place!  It totally exceeded all expectations... The staff was exceptional!  They were all so pleasant and accommodating, no matter what your needs.  We stayed 5 nights, so we had plenty of time to experience the full amenities of this hotel, and the surrounding area (Googlemaps it - we walked everywhere).  If I went  back to Barcelona, I wouldn't look anywhere else.",5,2017,08,26
14,Vacation Barcelona ,"In the gothic quarters a perfect location. The service in the hotel was amazing. Warm friendly and helpful customer service. Beautiful room and restaurant. Highly recommended!!!! The staff cannot do enough to make your stay perfect!!!!

14,Hidden gem in Barcelona ,"This hotel is a real find. We were the in August 2017  the staff were amazing and went out of their way to do anything we needed. They arranged dinner reservations ad transfers and taxi when needed  the breakfast was truly fabulous.! We ate dinner in the hotel on our last night and the food was out of this world. Every reccomendation from the staff was amazing and we loved it. 

They assisted us with everything we needed ad made our visit to Barcelona truly wonderful. 

The building that the hotel is in was very old and quite romantic. 

Highly recommend this hotel for a wonderful visit when in Barcelona 
",5,2017,08,25
14,Excellent stay,"Stayed here for two nights to end a two week trip to Spain - in Sitges and Barcelona. Had an excellent experience - comfortable, quiet room, very accommodating staff. Great bed linens, all very top notch and what to expect in an exceptional boutique hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering, and will return. Thank you. ",5,2017,08,24
14,Excellent,"Great location.  Amazing staff.  We were present during the attack at Las Ramblas and the hotel staff was very caring and treated the guests as family.  They called our phone to make sure we were safe, provided dinner in the hotel, and helped us get to the airport in the morning after.  If you stay here, have the taxi drop you off at the Cathedral.  The hotel is just 200-300 meters from there.  Highly recommended!",5,2017,08,19
14,Fabulous!! Look No Further!!,"Stayed here for our honeymoon. Riding the elevator up to our room, we noted a sign with the word: sensual, followed by a definition. Summmed up our stay perfectly! Our room even had a tub on the balcony overlooking an alley! The ambience/location/room/staff/service/breakfasts were all 5*! Had a night to remember after having an outstanding dinner outside in the courtyard! You will not be disappointed!",5,2017,08,18
14,Enjoyable experience with a few minor annoyances,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel Neri and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were considering Neri or Cotton House and after a friend stayed at Cotton HOuse and said the rooms were shoeboxes, we were happy with our decision. 

We debated between a 4 and a 5 but ultimately settled on a 4 for a few small reasons which I'll outline.

Positives:
- great location in the old gothic quarter, steps from the old cathedral, las rambles and very easy access to many main attractions 
- room size was actually larger than we were expecting. We've traveled a lot in Europe and expect a small room and while it was still smaller than an American hotel room, it was spacious for a European room with room for a desk, chair, 2 side tables and a bed with extra room to walk around comfortably.
- history of the building - parts were built in the 12 and 17th centuries and they have kept some remnants and details which make the structure authentic
- food/restaurant - we had lunch (once), breakfast (3 times) and wine/afternoon snacks by room service and everything we ate/drank was incredibly good. While our breakfast wasn't included (our mistake for thinking it was), it was about 25 euro per person but it was a great breakfast (croissants, eggs, jamon, fruit, bread, yogurt, etc).

Cons:
- natural light - even though we liked our room (105) for its size and it had two windows, we had to keep the drapes drawn most of the time we were in the room given its proximity to the building next door. There were probably 2-3 feet between us and the apartment building outside our window. This limited light into our room but also allowed random neighbors to see directly into our hotel room which was a little strange
- staff recommendations - we had asked the hotel to make 6 reservations at various restaurants in the city. 4 we gave them directly and then asked them to make 1 additional lunch and 1 dinner for us. Their lunch recommendation was great (botafumeiro) but their dinner recommendation (manna 75) was weak. So weak in fact we didn't go. Located near the W hotel in Barceloneta, when we showed up for our reservation there was barely anyone in the restaurant (other restaurants nearby were full). And while it was close to the water, it wasn't on the water. We ended up instead going around the corner where there were 4-5 restaurants along a promenade right on the water. It felt as if our hotel got some kickback for booking us there. 
Additionally, another time we asked about directions to Tibidabo (should we take the subway or is a cab better and where should we tell the cab to go) and the woman at the front desk couldn't respond. In fact she said ""I think the cab will know better than me."" And ""I'm not sure if Tibidabo is even open today. Hopefully you don't run into trouble""). She didn't offer to check if the tram was open or anything so was basically not helpful and caused us to have some doubt about our plans for the day (and the tram was open).
- AC - we were visiting in August and it was very hot. However, no matter how cold we turned the AC down the room never felt sufficiently chilled. When we called reception to ask if there was some setting that needed to be changed, they said they updated it from their end and it should now work. While it felt mildly cooler it was Ko where near how cold it should be for how low we set the temperature.
- sound from room - the rooms are definitely not sound proof and since the streets are actually relatively quiet anytime someone walked by we could hear their full conversation. This wasn't a huge hindrance but slightly annoying.

Neutral
- while this isn't a pro or a con, the hotel is very small. I'm not sure how many rooms, but there were never more than 2-3 other parties at breakfast with us. It is definitely a boutique hotel.

Overall we are happy with our decision and would recommend it to others but given the high value we placed on the Relais and Châteaux brand, we wanted to point out these few minor annoyances. ",4,2017,08,03
14,Hidden gem in the middle of the gothic quarter,"A wonderful hotel in a renovated and updated medieval palace. A beutifal and secluded hotel that is only steps away from everything Barcelona has to offer. Taxis are easy to get for travel to and from the hotel in the Plaza Jaume, and it is only a 5 minute walk from the Picasso museum, beach area, and La Rambla. Perfect location for seeing the city by foot and ending the day with romantic tableside drinks in the Plaza Neri. Would stay again without a doubt. ",5,2017,07,18
14,"Great Location, Impeccable Service and Comfortable Rooms","Hotel Neri is wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter. It's on a tiny side street steps away from the Cathedral in a former medieval palace from the XII century. Everything about this hotel is terrific. The breakfast is extra, but so worth it, with endless plates of meats, fruits and cheeses brought to your table, along with a full breakfast menu. There is also outdoor seating inside a shaded courtyard - a nice respite from the heat for a cool drink and a break from touring the city. The staff was incredibly attentive to all our needs and very helpful recommending local tapas places for a quick bite! And there is always a pitcher of cold lemon water and fresh baked cookies waiting in the lobby as you come and go. Wonderful area for browsing, shopping and eating. Don't miss a stop at Mannà Gelats just round the corner for some of the best gelato in Barcelona!",5,2017,07,16
14,Wonderful hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"From the moment we arrived we were catered to, nurtured by the staff and made to feel at home.  The hotel is wonderfully modern in the oldest part of Barcelona.  We are discerning travelers and the atmosphere as well as attention to our needs was unsurpassed. I cannot say enough about the decor, attentiveness and the wonderful restaurant.  I would give Hotel Neri the highest marks!",5,2017,07,10
14,Fantastic hotel tucked into the heart of Barcelona,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for several days and were blown away by the service, atmosphere, food, and location.  We were within walking distance of 90% of what we wanted to explore.  There is fantastic shopping surrounding the area where Neri is located, too.  The breakfast every morning was simple, yet delicious and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay pleasurable.  I would definitely stay here again if I return to Barcelona.",5,2017,07,07
14,Beautiful boutique hotel,"We unfortunately were only able to stay one night but highly recommend Hotel Neri. Even though our room wasn't ready when we arrived we were warmly welcomed and provided with drinks and they took our bags so we could go out and explore. The hotel is well located in the gothic quarter and the interior is really beautiful. We had room 207 which was lovely, not huge, but ample size for the two of us. I really liked the bathroom and the Molton brown amenities. Highly recommend drinks on the rooftop bar and breakfast in bed! A really relaxing overnight stay.",5,2017,07,03
14,Really good boutique hotel!,"I'm an architect and I'm traveling through Europe to find boutique hotel! I'm in love with Barcelona and so I began my ""boutique"" trip from this hotel! The experience was amazing! The design of the hotel is excellent and so the facilities! The staff was kind and helpful! The rooms were ok as I expected to find deferent rooms as concerned my job which is the design! Although the were really comfortable! I certainly recommend it!",5,2017,07,02
14,Unbeatable,"The best hotel we stayed at during a three week, five hotel journey.  The location is perfect.  The rooms are outstanding.  The service is personable yet professional.  We had two rooms, 102 and 103, that had a vestibule to allow the two rooms to be accessible.

Ask for room 102 as it has the only balcony looking over Neri Square and you can people watch with a drink in your hand!

One note... we have kids and enjoy the sound of young kids.  I say this because there is an elementary school that opens to the square so you hear them out playing. We love it but others may not.

By the way, they are just now renting apartments for longer stays which we toured and are already planning our trip.  Hotel Neri will be our home in Barcelona!",5,2017,06,26
14,What an absolute gem!,"My partner and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at Hotel Neri.  With being an employee of a Michelin Restaurant/Hotel in the UK, my standards are high when it comes to hotels and restaurants and I have to say that Hotel Neri far exceeded my expectations!

Everything was amazing from beginning to end – extremely happy and helpful staff across all sections of the hotel, nothing was too much trouble and everyone was happy to help. Great service in the restaurant/bar and on the last night (Sunday night) my partner and I enjoyed one of the most tastiest burgers, served on the stunning rooftop terrace, I think we have ever had!  The gentleman who was cooking on the BBQ on the rooftop terrace (I didn’t catch his name) was great, and the burger was cooked exactly as we had asked! Well done and thank you to him – great finish to our trip.  Breakfast was plentiful and a great selection.  Beautifully furnished and well kept rooms and the sheer design of the hotel was so tasteful.

Having never been to Barcelona before, I was unsure of what to expect of the location, but again, this was fantastic.  The gothic quarter is very pretty - ideal spot for a luxurious hotel!

My partner and I will definitely be back!",5,2017,06,20
14,Gothic quarter hideaway ,"Hidden away in the Jewish corridor, this hotel takes you away to another world.  I stayed here with my wife during a business visit to Barcelona and it transported me to a different world and time.  I highly recommend staying here during any visit to Barcelona.  If available, I recommend staying at the suites across the street at Casa Neri. Clean, large, modern suite.  ",5,2017,06,07
14,"A fantastic boutique hotel in a perfect location for walking to shops, restaurants and sites of interest.","I was traveling with two other couples and this was our first stop on a 10 day tour of Spain. What a gem. Tucked away in a small side street near the Barcelona Cathedral in a great area of Barcelona with rooms overlooking a great little square or the small streets around the hotel. The quality of the hotel, service, staff, and rooms was first class and excellent for the rate. The rooms were very spacious and excellent linens and decor. We considered it very affordable and of excellent value. It was minutes walk from cafes, bars, restaurants, shopping and several points of interest. It is part of the Relais and Chateaux group of independent hotels so you knew it was going to be good. Don't miss a drink on the roof top terrace!!!",5,2017,05,23
14,"Great location, super expensive, overwhelming fragrance","Our room looked onto a picturesque square and the bed was comfortable.  The window lacked a sheer curtain, so we either had to leave the heavy curtain closed (no light in the room) or open it to see the school playground directly across the courtyard.  The shower was uncomfortable.  The bar and restaurant were great, and the staff was exceptional.  The lobby and common areas are heavily fragranced--not really something I like.  There is no exercise room or gym.  Yes, I know I'm sounding picky, but for the price, I expect everything to be great--if not exceptional.",4,2017,05,19
14,A great central location for a traveler to Barcelona,"The rooms are all unique, and well laid out - although the switches are a bit complicated with no hotel directory to explain things.
Short walk to the Barcelona cathedral, as well as old town and other classic Barcelona neighborhoods.
Auto access is a little difficult. If one had a car I am not sure what you would do with it. Taxi's can't always get you to the door as it is close to a pedestrian mall.
Wonderful restaurants within walking distance, and the hotel has its own restaurant which is worth a dinner.
There is a great rooftop bar/restaurant with a view of the city.",5,2017,05,16
14,Elegant & a fantastic location ,"Great staff, fantastic location! The hotel and rooms are elegantly appointed and designed, modern styles and bathrooms.  You really can't beat the location if you want to see the Picasso Museum as well as the Market and outdoor flea market. Lots of options for food and drink and close to many boutique non- chain shops. Only drawback- and it wasn't really a problem because we didn't sleep in much- was the kids at the school next door are loud every once in a while. But this isn't a problem with all rooms ",5,2017,05,12
14,"Luxury, chic accommodations in the middle of the Barri Gotic","Comfortable, well appointed rooms  with just enough flair.

Las Ramblas or Plaça Catalanya just a short walk away.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
The apartment itself was clean and presentable,
The main lobby of this hotel extremely charming.
All in all, definatly a place i would recommend.",5,2017,04,28
14,"Gothic Quarter Five Star Property, Five Star Restaurant --- Six Star Staff","The Neri Hotel Barcelona is a special place for a number of reasons. The hotel is perfectly located, has a beautiful interior, great restaurant and a staff that makes the stay very special. This is a five star hotel without the bellboys hectic entries and hotel noise. Instead the Neri is a serene place staffed by efficent, friendly and cheerful staff.

The restaurant in which we ate twice is a very quiet space to dine after a day of touring.
I must say that people are reluctant to eat in a restaurant in a five star establishment for fear of excessively high prices or foods from the latest trends with foam or slow cooked( whatever that means). As an experienced traveler I share those traits and suggest a better job be done to convey the restaurant offers fine food at reasonable prices. 

Without question the restaurant offers for lunch and dinner excellent food and drink at reasonable prices. The chief and kitchen staff are proud of their food. For a tired or hungry persons I highly recommend the Neri Restaurant. Check out the menu it has great offerings. 
 
The location is in ""the old city"" within walking distance to it's sights, shopping, small cafes, restaurants and the Ramblas, the big Main Street.

If you are celebrating a special occasion or like us, just want to stay in a beautiful quiet place- where you are welcomed, the Neri Hotel Barcelona is an excellent choice.",5,2017,04,17
14,Can't recommend highly enough.,"From first to last the staff and hotel were fantastic. We (the better half and myself) stayed in a 'Classic' room which had plenty of space, great facilities and was beautifully appointed. The hotel is in my favourite part of Barcelona, the Gothic Quarter, and literally within a stones throw of the Cathedral of Barcelona. We like to walk and covered lots of ground during our stay but all the main sites (including Las Ramblas and the Sadrada Familia) were within walking distance, though we also used the Metro for the Camp Nou which was cheap and easy to navigate, The hotel is very close to two stations on different Metro lines which helps. Breakfast at the hotel was plentiful and catered for those wanting simple buffet continental style fare as well as having a cooked to order element including omelets, pancakes, bacon and eggs (any which way you like them). Behind the hotel is a pretty, enclosed square (Plaça de Sant Felip Neri) where you can sit at the hotels restaurant tables and enjoy a drink and the views. We also enjoyed sitting on the hotels fourth floor terrace enjoying the late afternoon sunshine (and Cava!).

I couldn't recommend the hotel more highly. A gem.",5,2017,04,07

14,Barce,"Fantastic cozy hotel.  Clean - friendly staff. Christina was great!!   When we were lost, she came to meet us and help roll a suitcase.  Always a smile. Loved the location in Gothic area.  Easy to get around- fairly central to most sites. Would go back in a minute. ",5,2017,04,06
14," Beautiful building","We really enjoyed our weekend with friends in Barcelona and loved the design and architecture of this Relais & Chateaux boutique hotel. Our room was very stylish and well decorated with a small balcony but I found it impossible to sleep as the narrow street leading to the square was extremely noisy so not so restful in the heart of the Barrio Gotico! Friday wasSt Patrick's Day but the windows and doors just arnt adequately sealed to protect you from the outside. We didn't have breakfast or a meal there but it looked quite nice. No drinks served in the bar after dinner which was disappointing. 
The taxi pick up service isn't worth the money and because there's a government building in the square taxis arnt allowed to drop off at the hotel but the hotel did come and collect us and bags from the square! Gorgeous candles burn in the reception which we wanted to buy but they are obviously popular and had sold out! Wa",4,2017,03,30
14,45th wedding anniversity,"Located in the heart of historic Barri Gotic take a step back in time exloring at night the
well lighted maze of  allyways and narrow streets with great reasturants and bars. We will return for our 50th.",5,2017,03,14
14,Amazing family trip,"We stayed as a family of 4 (kids 13 and 9) during a mild February half term. On arrival we were greeted with wine and soft drinks whilst we checked in. The hotel is an oasis of calm as soon as you enter, with dim lighting and the smell of incense. We were given a tour of the hotel and various vouchers for free drinks and snacks during our stay. We were then shown to our room. A short while later a lady knocked and presented us with a free bottle of cava in an ice bucket. 
Throughout our stay the staff were very attentive and friendly. The bar was quiet with good service. The restaurant was usually empty, but I think we stayed at a quiet time of year. There's a lovely roof top terrace where you can enjoy drinks, but we preferred to sit out in the square next to the heaters. 
The square is a small area which is bustling during the daytime (there is a school on it, and the kids use the square as their playground), but quiet of an evening. We loved to hear the children playing in the morning, but if you like to lie in bed all day then you should ask for a room away from the square.
The hotel is ideally located for the Ramblas and the cathedral, in a quaint part of town. Please bear in mind that you have to walk a short distance to get to the hotel, as cars can't get to the doors.
We loved it and would definitely stay again.",5,2017,03,10
14,Fantastic,Booked this for our first visit to Barcelona and was not disappointed with our choice. The hotel is located in the Gothic Quarter so you are close to all the historic attractions. The staff were excellent and made for an enjoyable stay. One not to be missed,5,2017,02,03
14,Another succesful Relais & Chateaux stay,"My wife and I spent 5 nights at the Hotel Neri in May, 2016.  I recommend the hotel.

I chose the Neri for two reasons:  (1) it was a member of Relais & Chateaux, and we’ve long had fabulous stays in member hotels around the world and (2) I wanted the medieval feel of a hotel in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.  The Neri came through on both ends – its Gothic Quarter location was exactly what I was looking for in terms of atmosphere and it is a very good representative of the best of what Relais & Chateaux properties have to offer, possessing plenty of each of the 5 “C’s” of the chain:  ‘Courtoisie, Charme, Caractère, Calme and Cuisine.’

The “courtesy” (I’ll switch to English before my spell check goes more nuts) was very obvious – the front desk staff were invariably gracious on our entry and exit (as a security measure, they actually have to buzz you in), and the breakfast staff was always courteous and friendly.  The “charm” and “character” were provided by the location – narrow streets, ancient surroundings – helped along by a terrific renovation of the historic buildings (one from the 12th century) that make up the hotel.  The outside is old, the inside essentially new.

“Calm” is relative – there was some truth to the complaints in earlier reviews about tourists and school kids in the square behind the hotel – but at night the hotel was very quiet, and frankly I have to think that for a city hotel voices are a far better background noise than traffic.

While we didn’t eat in the restaurant for dinner, for me “cuisine” was amply shown by great breakfasts, with more of everything on offer should you request.

Although the hotel is squarely in the Gothic quarter, we were never more than a 10 minute walk (delightful, by the way) to any one of 3 different metro stations.  And, on departure, cabs can present themselves in front of the hotel for the loading of luggage.  I would, however, recommend having the hotel arrange airport transfers, since arrival to the front of the hotel was non-obvious by vehicle.

Our room was a junior suite on the 3rd floor (4th, for Americans).  It was amply sized, with a separate couch and desk.  We had extensive storage along the entry wall – with plenty of places to allow you to unpack your folded clothes and hang all your hanging clothes.  The bed and desk were well lit, sadly the couch did not have reliable lighting at night (my only complaint about the room).  During the day, however, four large windows provided plenty of light.  

By the way, if you like light, as I do, ask for a higher floor, since I perceive the lower floors have much less light given the narrow streets.

The bathroom was decently sized, with two sinks and a shower/tub combo.  

HVAC worked flawlessly (it was never hot during our stay, so we didn’t test how well the A/C worked under stress).

By the way, a word of warning.  I looked at booking both with Amex (when we were there the Neri was a member of Amex’s Fine Hotels and Resorts) and directly.  Amex was the same price on its results screen, plus you got an 85 Euro credit.  I started the booking process with Amex, and when the “reservation” page came up I was appalled to see that the room rate had increased by 40 Euros (just about what the “free” Amex breakfasts cost).  I’d never had that happen before, but I was afraid to back out, since I was taking the last junior suite.  So, beware if the Amex price looks too good to be true.

That said, I’d gladly return to the Hotel Neri.",5,2017,01,31
14,BEST hotel ever!,"We chose to stay at Hotel Neri at the beginning & end of our honeymoon in Spain. During our first visit we stayed in a standard room (102) for 4 nights. Huge floor to ceiling windows opened onto the Plaza Neri. Absolutely delightful waking up to church bells & the sound of children playing below. Room style: modern, sleek w old world charm. Bed (King): firm, comfortable. Sheets: silky Egyptian cotton (you may select you preference of material for your sheets!). Cleanliness: excellent.

During our second visit, we stayed in one of their deluxe rooms w terrace (Room 306) for 4 nights. Awesome! Very private & quiet. Bathroom is larger (double sinks) than the standard room. The private terrace is divine! It includes a small dining area, lounge chairs & outside tub/shower large enough for 2 adults. Very romantic. Bed (King): firm, comfortable. Sheets: silky Egyptian cotton (you may select you preference of material for your sheets!). Cleanliness: excellent.

Breakfast in bed is a MUST! Totally worth the expense. We woke up to freshly cooked bacon, eggs, pan con tomate, croissants, Italian breakfast cake, hot coffee, freshly squeezed OJ, hot chocolate, freshly peeled & sliced assortment of fruits, jamón & gourmet yogurt w granola. 

Staff was exceptionally helpful! They assisted us in getting tickets in advance for busy popular tourist attractions, helped us plan our travel to attractions outside the city & made delicious recommendations & reservations (essential!) at local bars/restaurants for us.

We opted for their airport transfer service. Very efficient! We were met by the driver directly as we exited customs. We were assisted w our bags & driven via luxury car to the square closest to the hotel. Due to narrow alleys we completed the journey on foot. (The hotel is located in the Gothic Quarter - lots of charming but narrow alleys). The driver helped us with our bags all the way to the hotel.

Location is GREAT! We were able to walk to most attractions & restaurants. For sites further away, the nearest metro stop was only a few minutes walk from the hotel.

This was our FAVORITE hotel of our honeymoon. We'd return in a heartbeat. Thanks a million Neri Team for an unforgettably beautiful stay! ❤",5,2017,01,20
14,Great location and excellent service,"Hotel Neri is a small hotel in an unparalleled position in the Jewish quarter of Barcelona.  
It's staff are unbelievably helpful at the front desk, in the bar and restaurant and elsewhere. 
The rooms are adequate; the bathrooms are well appointed. The restaurant food and wine is better than most in Barcelona and good value 
The only challenge is the noise in the early hours from the St Felip Neri square at the back of the hotel:  the windows are not sufficiently noise insulated.   We slept poorly 2/4 nights as a result - and we are used to city noise. ",4,2017,01,16
14,Bad choice...,"""Neri or Mercer?"" That was the question that plagued my mind the last few days before leaving for Barcelona... If you are like me, picking a hotel can make or break my trip! So, I picked both... 3 nights there and 7 at the other... With tripadvisor I must be brutally honest... because that's what I would want to read about... the good, the bad and the ugly. Here's what I thought about Neri...

1. The Room- 2/5 very small... not a good value for the price... clean, comfy bed, but the decor not my taste... the outlets do not have converters or fit other kinds of plugs. Always kept curtains closed because window is so close to neighbor.... awkward. 
*bathroom 2/5 awkward layout... I was afraid every time when getting out of the shower that I was gonna slip and kill my self. They have a tub/shower combo with the sink directly next to the side without the glass wall. And the toilet took forever to fill up so you had to wait to flush again... 

2. Hotel- 
*location 4/5 centrally located; close to everything! Short walk to sites, shopping, eating, train station. 
*building 2/5 it's a beautiful building but it kind of has a weird smell.... like some old sewer pipes or something covered up with magnolia scented candles... another weird thing is you have to be buzzed in every time you want to come back... 

3. Staff 3/5 
Hit or miss. One gal was very nice and gave us excellent restaurant recommendations! One of the best tapas places we went to was based on her recommendation! And when we came back she opened the door for us and didn't just buzz us in. 
Another gal, not so friendly air about her. Not easily approachable.... 
and it seems like there is only one person on duty the entire time... one woman concierge, front desk, doorperson...

Bottom line... 
Expensive and not worth it... they say they are a 5 star hotel but I don't see it... sorry, but I do regret the 3 nights we spent there... but this is all just my opinion... 

Tips... Skip their breakfast, the best part was the fruit the warm food was meh... but the cappuccinos are amazing!! 

",2,2017,01,09
14,Neri,"Overall, very nice. No big complaints. They supplied us with Champagne for the new year and the breakfast was great. They ran out of a few things for breakfast each day, but we were among the last people there, so no big deal. One of the front desk staff was a bit condescending to us, probably because we are a bit younger and less experienced with the 5 star places. Not a huge deal, and we enjoyed our stay.",4,2017,01,04
14,Superb Hotel,"We recently had a nine day stay at this beautiful boutique hotel in the gothic quarter. The rooms were spacious with a very comfortable bed,my husband loved the stone shower. The bar/restaurant area was relaxing as we visited everyday for breakfast and then some evenings for a drink. The food was delicious! Last but not least I want to mention the gold star staff that helped us have the perfect vacation. They were so friendly in helping us book tours,giving us directions and advise about their city, not to mention remembering our names and making us feel so welcome. I would stay here again!!",5,2016,12,16
14,Perfect spot,"Great location in the shadow of the cathedral. Perfect combination of charming historical ambience from the 12th century, along with totally modern conveniences. Entire staff is cheerfully, personably attentive --a pleasure work with arranging touring and wonderful restaurant suggestions. Loved every minute. ",5,2016,12,15
14,Week-end in Barcelona,"A wonderful place in a magic town : the Gothic area of Barcelona. As far the Hotel Neri is concerned, all the charm of the12th century' stones with the highest comfort. Outstanding breakfast, and a delightful restaurant.",5,2016,12,12
14,Beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona's Gothic quarter,"The Hotel Neri is a wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter. It is beautifully situated, just behind the Cathedral, down a small lane, overlooking the Placa de Sant Felip Neri. The hotel is small, inviting and stylish. The staff are warm and welcoming. When we checked in we were greeted with a glass of cava and shown to our room, room 102 which overlooks the square. With its small balcony, it must be one of the best rooms in the hotel (it was a deluxe room). The room is stylish and well furnished, quiet, comfortable and with a good bathroom. The hotel breakfast was excellent and we also had one evening meal in the restaurant which was also very good. You can see from the photos the beauty  and grace of this small charming hotel. However it was the staff who really made our stay special , from Jacobi on reception (nothing was too much trouble - every request was met with a smile, a recommendation and a solution) to all the wonderful restaurant and bar staff (including 2 interns, 1 from Mexico and one from France, who judging on their warm welcome and professional approach, will both have great careers in hospitality). This is a very special hotel which comes with our strong recommendation. We look forward to returning.",5,2016,12,11
14,Wonderful stay at Hotel Neri,"Stayed for 7 nights, the first 4 in room 102, a classic room on the second floor (US) facing Placa Sant Felip Neri. We could see a tiny church with a school next to it, as well as trees and a little fountain. Yes, the square is full of children playing around after 9 am on school days, and tourists walk through the square all day long. It did not bother us very much. It was nice to see the activities outside and the scenery in sunshine and in rain. After that we moved to room 303, on the 4th floor (US), which was called a deluxe room with terrace. The room is bigger and the bathroom is larger, but there’s no view. Both rooms were nicely maintained. Every day, our room was made up perfectly nicely. 
All of the staff members were very nice and tried to accommodate our requests as much as possible in their own way. We had to leave the hotel at 7:40 am for our flight, but breakfast service starts at 7:30 am. We asked if it was possible to have breakfast at 6:30 am in the room, and they arranged a simple breakfast delivered to our room that time. This hotel has everything; just ask for it if you need their service.
One of the front desk staff, Jacopo, went above and beyond our expectations. We will return to Hotel Neri for our next stay in Barcelona.",5,2016,12,04
14,A Wonderful Balance of Gothic and Modern,"The hotel's ambiance and warmth stunned me.  It is set in the heart of the Gothic Quarter on a narrow, cobbled street in a centuries-old building, beautifully refurbished with subtle modern touches that only emphasize the grace of the bones of the building itself.  The location is superb and my room had a delightful, little balcony overlooking a small, stone-lined plaza.  Everyone on the staff was warm and welcoming, Ignacio, in particular, was always charming and helpful.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.  I highly, highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,12,03
14,Historic and Beautiful Hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"We stayed 4 nights mid October in this beautiful 12th Century hotel in the Gothic Quarter.  Within walking distance to Las Ramblas, the Zoo, the massive Ciutadella Park, the harbor, restaurants and more.  Could be difficult to find without GPS since it is not located on a busy street, but tucked away surrounded by pedestrian streets.  Taxi’s can access the hotel for dropoff or pickup, but it is difficult to navigate around all of the pedestrians, so we only used a taxi to the airport.  Taxi’s can easily be hired at Plaça de Sant Jaume, which is about a 3-5 minute walk from the hotel.

Room 306…… Spacious and comfortable.  There is a balcony, but there is no view from it, just a brick building 12 feet away.  Coffee maker and hot water kettle were nice.  Bathroom was a good size and plenty of counter space for toiletries, etc.  During the night, the hotel was so quiet.  There were no slamming doors or people talking.  We thought that maybe we were the only ones on the floor, but the staff said the hotel was full.

We had the included breakfast.  An assortment of sweets, breads, yogurts and juices.  We ordered omlettes that were cooked to order each morning.  The bar was nice to relax and drinks were a reasonable price.  There was a nice rooftop area, but we didn’t spend too much time up there since it was a little cold and rainy during our stay.

Staff was courteous and helpful.  They stored our bags when we arrived early on arrival.  Ordered our taxi when we departed.  Gave us suggestions for eating.  The hotel was clean and elegant.  Fantastic way to start our European vacation.",5,2016,12,02
14,A hidden gem in the Gothic Quarter!,"We loved this tiny hotel tucked into the Gothic Quarter in the shadow of the Cathedral. The room was supremely clean and comfortable, and the service was top notch. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,12,02
14,Worth the work to find it,"This is a romantic, boutique hotel, not for the business traveler.  Impossible to find without some work, we ended up parking our car in the nearby square (the hotel will guide you) and having our bags picked up by the staff while we returned our auto.  The hotel is small (maybe 30 rooms?), charming, and tucked away in the center of the ""gothic"" disctrict near all sorts of shops, sights, restaurants, and best, wonderful passageways and alleys.  We had a room with an outdoor bath and enjoyed breakfast at least twice (I believe 18E).  Most importantly, staff was remarkably kind and helpful, with all sorts of ideas and recommendations, and did get our taxi for return to airport.  will most definitely return.",5,2016,11,30
14,Hotel Neri,A quality contemporary boutique hotel. Very well situated and within easy walking distance of lots of good shops and tapas bars. Loved the Gothic quarter and would  recommend going there. Very friendly and efficient service and overall a very comfortable and attractive hotel.,5,2016,11,26
14,Gem of a hotel,"Set in the heart of the Gothic Quarter this beautiful old building is within walking distance of a lot of main attractions.Taxis will set you down in a square which is about a minute walk to the hotel though a narrow winding street.We were welcomed at reception and given drinks in the bar which was very welcome having been up early.Luckily our room was ready despite being early.We had booked a junior suite ,which are all situated on a the first floor.The room was stunning,large with a beautiful original ceiling and gorgeous bathroom.However we are both very light sleepers and despite it being November and quiet we did not get much sleep thanks to the assiduous street cleaning in the early hours of the morning.The hotel were very accommodating and showed us two other rooms that they were happy to move us into.We went into a deluxe double on the top floor and I have to say I thought it topped the junior suite.The room was smaller but it had a wrap around terrace with an outside bath! The bathroom indoors has a wonderful large shower.Taking a bath on a clear November night under the stars was truly memorable!We slept very well in this room.I enjoyed the breakfast at the hotel although as we are vegetarian the choice is limited and was expensive for what we ended up eating.The staff are friendly and very helpful and if we visit Barcelona again I would book into room 306 in a heartbeat. The one thing about staying the Gothic Quarter is that the rooms have very little privacy due to the buildings being so close to each other,some light voile drapes would be very useful in the junior suite as you have to close the curtains if you dont want your neighbours looking in.There is also a school in a nearby square which part of the hotel overlooks so dont expect peace and quiet during the day.It didn't bother us in the least as we were out most of the day and I like to hear the children playing.We took a quick peek at the rooftop bar and in the summer I can imagine this is a gorgeous place to sit and sip a glass of wine.All in all an excellent place to stay",5,2016,11,25
14,Exceptional,"Perfect in every way: character, location, service, comfort. This is an ideal hotel for a stay in the Barri Gotic and I highly recommend it. The welcome staff were very helpful in meeting special requests. ",5,2016,11,24
14,Treasure in gothic Barcelona ,"This beautiful small boutique hotel has got it just right. From greeting on arrival, chic yet understated, comfortable, and all staff polite and attentive. Fantastic small bar/restaurant to go with it. Room quiet, well maintained, comfortable and well finished. Amazing location in the narrow cobbled streets of gothic Barcelona. Personal service excellent. Note: when booking ticket to Sagrada Familia (a must see), make sure to include audio guide, because it can't be hired once there! David and Jayne Australian",5,2016,11,22
14,Memorable experience in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed at Hotel Neri for 3 nights over the weekend.

Since we arrived late in the evening at the airport we ordered Neri's limousine transfer form the airport to the hotel. The chauffeur was very kind and told us about some nice places to eat real local tapas and places to visit which are usually not mentioned in tour guides. Also the car ride was very comfortabe, clean and we had plenty of space for our legs. 
As we arrived at the hotel we felt genuinely welcomed by the front office manager who made the check in very smoth and efficient. He introduced the room (202) to us which had a wonderful view over a historic patio with a huge tree in the middle. The room was very cozy furnished and the stylish stone bathroom even had a heating lamp in the ceiling so you dont feel cold when you step out of the shower. The beds had more than enough space for two and were super comfortable to sleep in.

In the morning, at the first moment when I saw the breakfast I though that it was rather little than I would have expected. BUT! 2 minutes after we sat down and had a look at the menu a very friendly waiter brought us a wooden tray beautifully decorated with a variety of freshly cut fruits, breads topped with tiny tomato pieces and very tasty iberico ham on the side. In addition to that, you can order as much as you want from the menu. Everyday I ordered freshly made pancake with maple sirup and scrambled egg with bacon. You could also find fresh pressed kiwi, mango, strawberry and orange juice on the main buffet.

The hotel itself is very well located in the quiet area of the gothic quarter of Barcelona. Everything is in short walking distance. 2 minutes from the cathedral, 5 minutes from ""La Ramblas"" (for shopping), 10 minutes from the port.
If you need any tickets for a museum or so, you can already purchase them at the hotel which prevents you from all the hassle of going online and buy them with your CC. 

I want to thank all of your staff for their genuine care which made our stay a very memorable experience. Even the housekeeping lady, who would bring 2 chocholate pralines every evening to our room, was always happy and smiling when we saw her. 

This hotel really made us feel in good hands and we will therefore recommend this hotel to everyone out there!

The rooms are light and airy with a clean fresh sense of style. All the most important requirements for a perfect stay are in place. Comfortable bed? Check! Spa like bathroom with great shower/bath and plush towels? Check! Cozy places to sit and relax? Check! Great dining? Check! Modern luxury? Check!

14,Delightful boutique hotel in the heart of El Gotico,"Hotel Neri is a wonderful hotel, located in a renovated ancient building the the heart of the gothic quarter.  The staff was wonderful to work with and the surroundings couldn't have been more tranquil.  We had room 102, which looked out over the old square behind the hotel. While it could be somewhat noisy at times (schoolchildren in morning, cleaners, tours, etc.), the view was fantastic and we were up early anyway.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants an authentic experience in beautiful surroundings.",5,2016,11,15
14,One of my best ever trail memories!,I was lucky enough to stay at this hotel with my Mother as part of a mother-daughter trip last Christmas. It is and will remain one of my best ever hotel experiences I would recommend  it to anyone that is looking for a unique and pampered experience in an area with great atmosphere. I only hope I have the chance to visit again!,5,2016,11,09
14,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,"I have stayed many times in Barcelona, but this is by far the most outstanding property I have ever stayed at. The ambience, location, attention to detail, staff, rooms, dining and rooftop oasis were all beyond compare. It is in a unique hideaway location in the Gothic Quarter which adds to its charm. I would give it 6* if I could. Relais & Chateau brand never disappoints. The balcony in our room overlooked the historic  courtyard which added to the romance. Modern luxury enveloped in a historic building. Beds were also amazingly comfortable.",5,2016,11,08
14,Alexandra28,"This is the best ""boutique"" hotel I have ever stayed in. Why? The staff were  lovely, friendly & knowledgable about where to eat, shop etc. We knew what we wanted to see & they were helpful about how to get there. We had a corner room, so very light. Comfortable bed & good quality bed linen which is very important to me. Great breakfasts but best to eat dinner out as you can eat very well for less than the hotel restaurant. In reception they burn candles all day long which permeate the whole building; I can still conjure up the smell of lavender & mimosa.

14,Excellent hotel in a central location,"We travelled as a family of four during October half term.  Our two rooms were ideal for two adults and two teens (opposite each other at the end of a quiet corridor).  Small,  quality hotel.  Staff attentive but discreet.  Excellent room service and exceptional bathroom facilities.  Would recommend for couples and families with teens alike.  Very close to centre of city and walking distance to everywhere. (We only used a taxi to and from the hotel however there is an airport bus every 20 minutes to and from the centre).
Highly recommend for those wishing to be in the heart of the city but away from the main Ramblas area.",5,2016,11,05
14,Peaceful oasis in the heart of the gothic quarter,"The ambiance, service and quality make the Neri an oasis of calm in the middle of the old gothic quarter. The staff is exceedingly well trained, helpful and friendly, providing superb personalized customer service.  ",5,2016,11,05
14,4 night stay,"Location is perfect. Its situation, though, is limited and my only reason for not giving it 5 stars. Semi-detached on one side, overlooking two tiny streets on two sides, with the fourth side overlooking an attractive little square.

This place is very well run by a comparatively young staff, who are obviously well-trained, charming, efficient and helpful.

Our room, overlooking the square, was very comfortable and spotless.

We did not dine here, simply because of our itinerary. 

We would certainly recommend it.",4,2016,11,05
14,Perfect Place to Stay in Barcelona,"Hotel Neri is a jewel. Located in a 12th century palazzo, it is a chic, modern, small (22 rooms) hotel. Walking in, you are struck by the blending of the historic architecture and the contemporary furnishings. The hotel is located on a narrow street in the historic Gothic Quarter, a fabulous location and convenient to most parts of the city. The breakfasts are wonderful, and don't miss having a drink or snack on the roof top deck. Our room was lovely with high quality bedding and a nice sized bathroom. The service was top notch; the staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. Everything about this hotel is top quality. You can't go wrong staying at Hotel Neri.",5,2016,11,02
14,Great Find in the best location,"On vacation location is critical, you don't want to spend time going to and from somewhere you want to be.  This hotel is perfectly located in a lively area, close to great shops, restaurants, and sights, but also it is a residential neighborhood with a school next door.  The children playing in the courtyard was a surprise, and we used a sound machine to not get disturbed, but it was also a wonderful way to feel almost like part of the community.  Service was wonderful, particularly the concierge who helped us with tickets, directions, and everything we could need.",5,2016,11,02
14,Perfect location in Old Town Barcelona;  impeccable service.,"To help make your Barcelona stay perfect, choose the perfect hotel Neri!  The location in Old town is ideal.  The hotel service is superb.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and has wonderful suggestions.  The rooms are immaculate and very comfortable.  The boutique size (22 rooms) gives the Neri a feeling of being home rather than far away. I can't imagine a more comfortable hotel experience in Barcelona.",5,2016,10,30
14,The Neri Experience,"Great location in Gothic quarter, Deluxe Room and terrace up to Relay Chateaux standards and all 5*. The restaurant, staff, our booked tasting menu and the bottle of cava in our room on arrival did not happen. We paid for 5* service and got 3* at best as we had to ask repeatedly for many things.

Nothing bad but certainly not one of the best Relay Chateaux.  If you want 5* then I would look elsewhere until the staff get their act together.",3,2016,10,26
14,Top notch lodgings in Barcelona ,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights last week. The first two were planned. The last evening was because our return flight to the USA was cancelled. I can't say enough nice things about the staff, especially Maria who worked hard for us after the flight cancellations. The level of service was excellent. ",5,2016,10,20
14,Two days in Barcelona ,"This hotel is very contemporary.  It's in a very narrow corridor & hard to find without GPS.  The rooms were spacious.  We were on the 2nd floor and 3 windows faced the corner.  We had to close the drapes as the neighbors could look directly in at us.  There is a school next door and the children play outside for hours and are very noisy.  You can hear everyone walking around as the floors are wood and everything echoes every where.  

The people drinking in the restaurant below on the weekends stay very late - until 2-3 am and a lot of smoke and idle chit chat you can hear until 3am when everyone finally goes home. Then the street cleaning starts about 3:30am & again at 5:30am.  

If your looking for a place to relax I wouldn't recommend this hotel.  

The staff were very pleasant and the restaurant delicious.

14,Not all I'd hoped for ... but still a worthy choice,"Noticed this well located little hotel some years ago and made a mental note to return ... I probably over-anticipated its appeal because when I did eventually make it there I felt rather underwhelmed ... the furniture was looking a little tired, my room rather gloomy and the breakfast space rather cramped. That said, it has a great location near the Gothic cathedral, it's arty and welcoming and it has a certain style about it.",3,2016,10,12
14,Very Unique decor,"Beautiful, but very difficult to get to by cab.  We came on holiday and had to wander small cobblestone streets with luggage hot day for 1.5 hrs because taxi could not get thru guards and crowds near cathedral.  
Hotel was nice.  Breakfast very pricey, great service.",4,2016,10,05
14,Lovely hotel in a great area of Barcelona,"We just left this hotel and had a lovely stay. We were there for vacation with friends, and loved the hotel and its location. Very close to shops, restaurants, places. The hotel is beautiful, and it has characteristics from centuries past. 

The room was lovely. It was spacious, loved the bathroom (that stone is just gorgeous!). Our room overlooked the courtyard, which can be noisy when the school children are at recess. 

Kudos to the ladies in housekeeping. Those rooms are immaculate!

Food and wine in the restaurant were very good. We will return to Hotel Neri again.",4,2016,10,03
14,Quaint Hotel Neri in Gothic quarter,"This is a cute hotel we stayed here for 3 days and three days at the Mandarin Oriental which was sold out the good features are excellent location in the Latin quarter cool building used to be a medieval castle the staff is very friendly .
Things i did not like very poor accessibility streets too narrow for cabs the cab can't come to the hotel you have to log your luggage at least half a mile and guess what the housekeeping did not clean our room till at least 8 pm we were out on a long day left at 9 am room was not done till 8 pm REALLY!
I would say not 5 star 4 star even if Relais and  Chateau runs it",4,2016,10,01
14,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at Hotel Neri for 4 nights. Our room overlooked the square at the rear of the hotel. It was a good size with a comfortable bed and tastefully decorated.  We ate in the excellent hotel restaurant on our first and last nights. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay there again. The central location in the Gothic Quarter was ideal.",5,2016,09,30
14,An oasis of stylish calm,"What a gem of a hotel.  Housed inside an old stone structure, taking advantage of large interior spaces, elegantly dressed with just enough, not too much, furnishing.  The staff are unfailingly helpful and courteous.  Couldn't have enjoyed it more.",5,2016,09,26
14,Not Guest Friendly-Unresponsive-,"Hotel Neri looks very nice and well appointed with charming ambiance, however I would classify them as borderline deceitful and dishonest. We were charged for a room and paid for it, but after paying for it we were told it was not available and then not give a key or the room. They then refused to return my money for an unused room!",1,2016,09,22
14,Hotel Neri disappointment,"When planning our 2016 trip to Spain, hotels were very important to us and one of our go to websites is Relais & Chateaux, they always offer wonderful hotels and have never let us down, until Barcelona. We chose Hotel Neri to end our fantastic Spain adventure in a beautiful historic hotel in the Gothic Quarter, and we were very disappointed in our choice. Yes, the hotel is beautiful and located in a fantastic setting with many wonderful amenities’, unfortunately for us we were never told there would be a wedding on site and we would not be able to use most of the hotel. We book at least 6 month out and were ready to enjoy a relaxing weekend. Arriving back from our mid-day tour we had hope to have tea on the roof top patio, but no they were setting up for a wedding that evening and the roof top would not be open at all that evening to enjoy, there went drinks before dinner, also. So, we decided to have tea in the square outside the bar, yes we were able to order tea, but when asked for a dessert menu we were told it was only available with the restaurant lunch, personally I did not understand why this was any different than ordering from room service in our room. Then, evening came and we went down to have a drink in the bar, but no they were closed also for the wedding dinner along with the main dinning room. Managed to at lease get a glass of wine and were going to go enjoy that in the lounge, but no that was closed and only open to restaurant dinning that night. Ended up, having to have our wine in the lobby, along with 4 other guests that were first turned away from the bar, also. A quote from your website, “We do our best to offer to all our guests the services and facilities to make their stay a memorable one.” This we did not receive! Will we be recommending you hotel to our friends, unfortunately no. Do we feel we were taken advantage of and ripped-off, yes we do.",1,2016,09,21
14,Everything you would expect from a Relais & Chateaux...,"The service, the ambiance and the amenities were all first class! Don't let the sparse dining room put you off the food was terrific but the service was even more amazing. We traveled through four countries in two weeks and this property made us feel truly welcome - special thank you to our Belgian server!",5,2016,09,19
14,"Beautiful, but such bad form...","The hotel is beautiful--- a jewel tucked into the most cozy corner of the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. It is extremely well appointed--- the lobby, as well as our room [ the bathroom was gorgeous]. BUT: Our room was too small, without adequate space to store our suitcases [ which were large, as we were on an extended holiday even though our stay at The Neri was only two nights--- but we were still forced to step over them whenever we went anywhere in the room]. Worse than that, though, was that we learned after check in that the hotel had been booked for a wedding for the entire duration of our stay, so that all of the common areas of the hotel [ the bar, the restaurant, the roof deck] would be closed to us or otherwise unattended for entire time we were there. When we found this out and expressed our disappointment to the hotel staff , we were greeted with non-apologies and quizzical glances. A heads up, prior to check in, would have been appropriate, we said. And a reduction in the room rate, to compensate for the inconvenience and lost amenities. Our suggestions were politely laughed at, so although the hotel is beautiful, we won't be returning.",2,2016,09,16
14,Amazing!,"This hotel is simply amazing.  It is very clean and tidy.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The location is... perfect!  If you make the wise decision to stay at the Neri Hotel don't forget to check out the garden on the fourth floor!

I can't wait to visit Catalonia and the Neri hotel again!",5,2016,09,14
14,John and Antonia london,This place is in the centre of the Gothic area really well positioned .. the staff especially the lady on reception were extremely kind and helpful .. if I was to stay in the Gothic area again I would definitely stay here .. it's not the biggest of hotels but it's really sweet .. kind .. well positioned..and comfortable,5,2016,09,10
14,"Nice hotel, breakfast a disappointment","This classic hotel is nicely situated in the Gothic room.  The staff are very accommodating and the room, whilst small was nicely furnished.  The breakfast however, was another matter, they try quite hard with a board of cheese/meats but its tiny for two people.  After this you can then choose a la carte.  On our last day one of us ordered boiled eggs which quite frankly would have made us very ill if we'd have eaten them!  We mentioned this to the front desk who apologised but offered no recompense - as we had obv paid B&B price, they should have refunded the breakfast part - not good enough IMO for a R&C property.",3,2016,09,09
14,Boutique hotel in the heart of the gothic quarter,"A comfortable small hotel in the gothic quarter.  Limited amenities but amazing front of house staff.
The roof garden is a disappointment and breakfast in summer is inside which is quite dark.
The hotel is an interesting combination of modern and gothic and perfectly situated for exploring the gothic quarter of Barcelona.",4,2016,09,07
14,Exactly What You Expect from Relais and Chateaux,"Stylish, exceptional service, all amenities attended to. Flawless.  Would stay there again.....what else can I say?  There aren't many rooms (less than 25) and they're small and modern but have everything you need.  The staff is happy to see you and attentive and see that you have exactly what you need.  The bedding is exceptional.  It's all in the details!",5,2016,09,06
14,We return to Neri Hotel,Four years ago we chose to stay 3 days at the Neri Hotel.   We so enjoyed our time there and we decided to stay for four days at the conclusion of our most recent trip to Spain.  Barcelona is a beautiful city and we love being centered in the old town near the cathedral in the many  specialty shops.  We were not disappointed in anyway. The staff is exceptional the hotel beautiful the location for our many walks  Perfect.,5,2016,09,06
14,Barcelona for 10 year wedding anniversary,What a fantastic hotel - a calm relaxing oasis right in the middle of the gothic quarter situated right next to the cathedral. Our room was amazing and the outside space was fantastic. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. Enjoyed a drink in a hammock on the roof terrace!! I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious relaxing place to stay.,5,2016,09,06
14,Neri hotel.  Great boutique hotel ,Great boutique hotel. Outstanding perfect location in the barri gothic area behind plaza Philip neri. Plaza was bombed by Italians during Spanish civil war and 42 children were killed.  Walls retain scrapnel markings.   Great live local musicians.     Wild vibe with cemetery beneath    Definitely recommend.  Great staff.  Comfortable rooms.  Recommend without reservation ,5,2016,08,24
14,Great Location Limited Amenity and Average Breakfast,"Main entry is nice location is great. The room overall was fairly well appointed but below five star boutique in my view.

Breakfast was ordinary with bad coffee so worth trying the local surrounds. There is nothing new in this for me with most hotels struggling on the breakfast front.

Would I stay there again probably not.",3,2016,08,15
14,A luxurious hotel in the heart of the Gothique Quarter,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel Neri, which is in the Old Quarter of Barcelona, and housed in an edifice that dates to the Middle Ages, with Romanesque arches, but which has been transformed into a chic, boutique style hotel.  Our room overlooked a quaint inner courtyard that was frequently used by hotel guests to eat their breakfast or sip their drinks, and by visitors who wished to catch a glimpse of Barcelona history by viewing the pockmarked courtyard walls caused by cannon fire during the Spanish Civil War.  Yet the walls are so thick that we never heard any sounds emanating from the courtyard.  Our room itself was spacious with a very comfortable bed and lots of room in the bathroom.  Breakfast is included with your stay at a rate that is a real bargain compared to other places we have stayed.  And because the hotel is situated in the old Gothique area, you are only a 5 minute walk to the Picasso museum, a 10 minute walk to the Palau Musica de Catalona, a 20 minute walk to the Gaudi houses on Gracia, and a 15 minute walk to the markets off of La Rambla.  You also have easy access to the hills that overlook Barcelona and its harbor, although I recommend taking a taxi to this area.  Here you will find the Miro Foundation, a museum dedicated to the works of Miro, and beautiful gardens filled with cacti in which you can stroll.  Hotel Neri's staff was very helpful giving suggestions about what to see, where to eat, and how to get there.  Their good judgment and attentiveness enhanced our stay immeasurably, and helped us to make the most of our short (4 day) stay in Barcelona.  Next time we'll stay longer, and we'll return to the Hotel Neri as our base in Barcelona.",5,2016,08,12
14,Great experience,"Wonderful boutique hotel in middle of Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. Very helpful and friendly and when we showed up 5 hours before normal check in. Within an hour we had our rooms, bags delivered and they had scheduled a personal guide for that afternoon. Rooms were very clean and well appointed. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona. ",5,2016,08,10
14,A Charming Boutique Hotel in The Gothic Quarter,"We traveled and toured Europe and stayed in smaller boutique hotels and our favorite was Hotel Neri.  We loved the location of the hotel and sitting in the courtyard on their patio was amazing (day or night).  Our two rooms had balconies that were small sanctuaries with outside bathtubs as well as lounge seating and a small bistro-style table.  The hotel is small and delightful - the lighting design and decor throughout was very charming.  I am not a big Mojito drinker, but after someone insisted that I try one (I did) and it was also amazing.  Great staff, and very friendly.  We will certainly be back!",5,2016,08,08
14,Loved it except for mildew/shower water problem,"Beautiful room, excellent staff, terrific location.  But we can't give it 5 stars because every time we walked into the room there was a mildew smell.  We would become used to it within a few minutes but the next time we came back to the room, there it was again.  The shower/tub (the same design is shown for every room on the website) has a design flaw.  No matter where you stood or how you positioned the shower head, water accumulated on the stone base between the tub and glass partition and then ran down onto the floor.  The stone and tub rim were, alas, not tilted to direct water back into the tub.The stone was permanently discolored where the water flowed to the floor.  We also noticed a large water stain on the stone under the sink.  The water problems may have led to the odor.   If you aren't sensitive to odors and if you don't mind making a towel dam for the shower, the Neri is perfect.",4,2016,08,07
14,Really hate to let this place get on everyone's RADAR.,"Planning a trip back to Barcelona soon and would hate to not be able to get a room here! Amazing is all I can say about it. Staff is phenomenal and the location in the Gothic Quarter is perfect. Just sat in the courtyard and watched people for hours - along with cheese tray and beer/wine. So relaxing and quiet, out of the craziness of the rest of the city. Perfect place for couples. Iggy got us checked in early (10 AM) and was very helpful. Overall, one of the best hotel experiences we have had in Europe. ",5,2016,08,06
14,Wonderful Experience,"Hotel Neri is such a Barcelona dream experience.  Amazing location in the Gothic area and the hospitality impeccable.  Beautiful modern interior.  Highly recommend, this is now our go to hotel for Barcelona!!  Also check out the restaurant and eat in the courtyard.",5,2016,08,04
14,Hotel Villa Ambiente in Marvelous Barcelona Gotic Quarter,"A must-experience pearl amidst Barcelona's Gotic culture and history with many boutique shopping around. The Neri Hotel is carefully appointed with design elements that give it a personal and exclusive touch and care. The staff is just great and professional in providing a very personal and seamless service.
You should book the room with its own private terrace and outdoor bathtub to enjoy a midnight bath under the stars and a rich breakfast served by room service in the morning. Paradise!
Then the restaurant with its patio terrace in a quiet plaza to enjoy an undisturbed delicious lunch or dinner.
And the pricing? Worth every penny!!",5,2016,08,04
14,What a Gem!,"We just left this hotel and very much enjoyed our stay. We were a party of 10 and had 6 different rooms. All of them were well designed, comfortable, and the hotel service was terrific. The location is right in the Gothic Quarter which was convenient. I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,07,30
14,Great boutique hotel in the best area of Barcelona,The last time I was in Barcelona I stayed at the Mandarin which I did not really love.  Hotel Neri is right in the middle of the Old part of Barcelona and you can walk out the door and wander for hours through the small shops and restaurants in that area.  The bar and restaurant were great and the suite we stayed in was spacious and really nice.  The hotel itself is gorgeous and the staff were the ones that made all the difference for us.  Upon checking in there was an issue with another guest who would not check out of our room until almost 5pm.  The staff provided another room for us to wait in but also did everything in their power and went above and beyond to make it up to us the entire trip.  I can't rate this place highly enough!,5,2016,07,28
14,EXCELLENT!,"We LOVED everything about this hotel - the service is outstanding, the rooms and atmosphere are wonderful, with the added bonus of being able to walk centrally around Barcelona.  The only downside was coming from the airport with a cab driver who had no idea where he was going - so we would highly recommend you arrange for a hotel collection beforehand. 

We would definitely recommend this wonderful find in central Barcelona and would stay again if we had the chance.  This place is a must stay!",5,2016,07,27
14,Poor food,"We arrived at this hotel early morning after a hike with our suitcases because our taxi could not enter the little street the hotel is located on due to traffic restrictions at certain times. Having said that we did see other taxis arriving to either drop off of pickup at the hotel. We had pre arranged transport the day of our checkout and we had to walk again to our waiting car in a nearby street. This might be an issue if you are elderly or have difficulty walking?
The young men at reception at checkin were polite, friendly and made us feel very welcome. 
I felt the hotel and its facilities were not properly explained as we missed having a drink on the roof top terrace??
The food we did have was very basic and I did not enjoy any of it. We made no further plans to have dinner at the hotel based on what we sampled for lunch and very early evening. I skipped breakfast again based on my experience with the food. Big let down regarding the food.
Our room was large, air conditioned, clean and quite minimal. The room had a lovely balcony over looking the public courtyard to the rear. Noise was not a problem as the balcony doors were double glazed. 
This is a beautiful character boutique hotel and was lovely. It's well located to many shops and not far from the number 2 stop on the hop on hop off bus. Just look for the cathedral as your landmark to finding the hotel.
Overall our 1 night stay was nice enough but I was hugely disappointed with the food. I don't know if I would return based on that alone. Shame really as Neri Hotel has a lot going for it.",3,2016,07,25
14,Beautiful hotel set in a 12th century building.,"Great location and beautiful building. The hotel was great, staff were super friendly. Also had the manager come and greet s on our arrival. The concierge gave good recommendations on wine shops. I noticed that it was not just us but other guests were also recommended a modern gastronomy restaurant (which we did not enjoy at all) - some traditional Catalonian cuisine would be good for people who have not been to Barcelona at before. The late check-out is ridiculously expensive for a few hours worth of time.",4,2016,07,25
14,Dinner at the most beautiful & quitest square in Barcelona,"This is one of my favourites places in Barcelona. So calm so silent...
Within the Gothic area, close to the cathedral, you can see the bomb impacts in the wall happened during the Civil War when so many people died.
Don't miss to book a dinner in the Hotel Neri, and ask for the terrace on spring or summer. So high quality meal, excelent and friendly service. And after that, go and walk through those narrow streets.",5,2016,07,23
14,Just Wonderful ,"We recently stayed in this wonderful hotel. The location, the staff, the ambience here, is hard to beat.
The rooms are generous, as are the bathrooms. They are decorated with a mix of antiques and modern pieces, that works really well.
The dinner is served inside or in the courtyard. The menu isn't extensive, but very good. Drinks on the rooftop is also very good.
We will definitely stay here again next visit to Barcelona ",5,2016,07,23
14,Perfect In the Gothic Quarter,"The gothic quarter is so magical and this hotel just takes it to another level.  It is oriented well with the cathedral to the west.  The service and help was fantastic from check-in, to returning from runs, to service at breakfast and lunch in the plaza.  Great place in a great part of a great and friendly city.",5,2016,07,21
14,"Good location, well done renovation/decor","Stayed one night here, very pleased with the property. A/C in room worked great, nice finishes throughout, neat property history, friendly and attentive staff.

Only issue was with the private transportation we booked through Hotel Neri. Arrival transport was perfect - driver met us right on time and dropped us off right at the door. Departure was over 15 minutes late and we had to follow hotel staff to a nearby square as the vehicle used was too large to fit down the narrow street/alley by the hotel. Very frustrating given the reason we had opted for this transport and paid more than for a cab was to avoid these very issues.",4,2016,07,20
14,this hotel is spectacular!!!!,The location and quaintness is everything!  Very personal service.  The attention to detail is incredible!  The food service and quality of the food was impressive.  My family just did not want to leave the hotel because they loved it!,5,2016,07,20
14,"Chic, Charming & Centrally-Located Boutique Hotel with Excellent Staff","I can't say enough good things about my recent stay at the Hotel Neri...Between its welcoming, knowledgeable and accommodating staff members; its appealing mix of chic/modern decor within a charming medieval palace; its central location (I loved being able to walk to sites such as the cathedral, the Picasso museum, Las Ramblas, La Boqueria, Port Vell, Santa Maria del Mar and more); and the upscale restaurant and roof bar -- throughout my stay, my family members and I kept saying how lucky we were to have found this wonderful boutique hotel.  Nice touches included them leaving milk and cookies in the room each afternoon for my 5-year-old nephew, helping us book advance tickets for the Gaudi sites and Miro museum and serving a delicious breakfast in the medieval square behind the hotel.  I would absolutely stay there again during my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,07,19
14,Perfectly lovely boutique hotel in the Gothic quarter,"We had a quiet deluxe terrace corner room 305 and it was gorgeous. The bathroom was exquisite because of the stone material that had been used.  The beds and pillows were perfect.  It had a great outlook.  Unfortunately the safe was dodgy and when it became jammed it took quite some time to reopen it. We regretted having to waste time to get it sorted as it was not so simple.  (It took numerous visits to the room.) The breakfast food and area was beautiful, however the service was poor.  Owing to the position in the Gothic quarter, the overall ambience, the indoor/outdoor restaurant area and our beautiful room, bedding and bathroom, I would highly recommend a stay in the deluxe terrace room. ",5,2016,07,18
14,"Wonderful hotel, terrific staff","We just stayed in this wonderful find in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.  The hotel rooms are lovely, the bathrooms unique.  An old castle refurbished into a hotel.  The hotel staff could not be nicer.  They assisted our friends with lost baggage and went above and beyond.  I would recommend this hotel without question.",4,2016,07,17
14,Superb,"I travel a lot, and this is one of my favorite hotels anywhere. The place is tiny but the rooms are huge. The hotel is in an ideal location in the Gothic Quarter, sharing a square with the Church of Sant Felip Neri, a mandatory stop in Barcelona. The service is warmly impeccable, the bar and restaurant are a delight and the decor (modern within an ancient building) is in wonderful taste.",5,2016,07,16
14,Top notch,"Fab location in the centre of barrio gotic, great rooms, brilliant bathrooms, swish reno in historic old building - just an excellent place! Costs a little extra but worth it. Restaurant also quite expensive compared to local external eateries but if you elect to use it ask them to set up a table for you in the square (one wall of the hotel backs onto a tiny square that is very tucked away and very few people from outside manage to find it). Great service from staff. Roof top bar a good spot too.",5,2016,07,15
14,High Marks Across the Board,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this lovely hotel (once we found it). Tucked away in the Gothic Quarter of the city, the hotel presents an oasis of calm and sits on the edge of a small, hidden church square with a tragic role in recent history. The location is brilliant, and the staff are knowledgeable and very helpful -- in fact the concierge even printed walking directions for me to the nearest launderette (a rarity in Spain, as it turns out) when I mentioned I needed a little help in this capacity. All of the features one would expect of a R&C property, with some additional bonuses for an urban hotel including a lovely rooftop bar and spacious well appointed rooms. We were traveling as a family, and the room setup was particularly good with two rooms and a shared foyer.",5,2016,07,14
14,Last city on our long  holiday to Europe!,"Very good experience, good location! Comfortable room but a lot of noise from the terrace above,early in the morning! We were on the 3rd floor! Staff very attentive and helpful! Breakfast maybe a little on the light side! Loved the bath and shower on the balcony!

",5,2016,07,13
14,Small luxury hotel,"Just 22 luxury rooms, located in the gothic quarter with an outside dining area for lunch and dinner in the square. Great food and service. Gothic and Born areas very close and 10 mins walk to the sea front.  Use the hotel's transfer service, it is hard to get to the hotel by cab as it is in an area of narrow ancient streets.",5,2016,07,07
14,Outstanding experience at the NERI,"We REALLY enjoyed our experience at the NERI. Only good memories for a honeymoon trip in Barcelona. Outstanding location. We also particularly appreciated the warm welcome, the quality of service and advice for restaurants and direction of a young trainee at reception desk  (Julie was her name I believe). Take good care of her.  She's precious for an organisation like your's!",5,2016,07,06
14,lovely hotel in superb location,This is a wonderful hotel in a superb location in the heart of the gothic quarter next to the cathedral. perfect for a visit to barcelona. Its in a beautiful building and has a wonderful roof terrace plus you can dine in the pretty square behind it. Food and service was excellent. Only two glitches were a restaurant reservation that never made it from the reception desk into a booking - which was a touch painful when discovered but we found a great replacement and the handbasin in the otherwise luxurious suite did not drain properly,4,2016,07,05
14,Nice boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter,"We stayed here at the end of June.  We like the R&C properties and have stayed at many of them.   A few points on this properties.

1. Great location.  
2. Beautiful setting. 
3. Nice lunch
4. Roof top terrace. 
5. Friendly and attentive staff
6. Comfortable beds and pillows.  One of the best experienced.
7. Outside a bit noisy.  Wish the windows were more sound proofed.   

We would stay here again!",4,2016,07,03
14,Great hotel,"A great hotel in the middle of old gothic town but inside renovate so beautiful and romantic
You can walk around for the old quarter of the city
The area make you feel like living back in the old time
Very beautiful historic hotel",5,2016,06,30
14,Beautiful & Historic,"Customer service abounds in this beautiful renovated old building in the Gothic quarter. The location is perfect for tourist to walk to everything, and the staff was very helpful with directions, booking tours ect.",5,2016,06,26
14,"The ambiance of Hotel Neri is beyond expectation.  The decor, the location, the food, the charming staff are the best!","Couldn't have had a better experience at Hotel Neri, Barcelona!  Welcome drink on arrival, charming, well appointed rooms, great food, superior service.  Staff can recommend anything you want to do, complete with map noting nearby areas.
Anything you want or need is possible through the staff!",5,2016,06,25
14,Not up to standards,"Located on a narrow street in the Gothic Quarter, this renovated old building, on first entering, is stunning. The rooms are nicely appointed and well equipped. Just don't start reading ""Cathedrals of the Sea"" that we believed was complimentary. We arrived home to discover they had charged us 17 euro for the book. Also be aware that the rooms are anything but quiet. Our suite overlooked a lovely courtyard. There is an elementary school in that courtyard filled with screaming children during the day and ""partiers"" at night. The restaurant was hugely disappointing (except for the wait staff who were excellent). The chairs and tables looked like they were borrowed from a cafeteria and very uncomfortable. My wife and I both had fish (Sea Bass and Turbot). The turbot was 90% bone and fat and can only be described as disgusting. The Sea Bass was mediocre at best. There is no way this restaurant should be listed as Relais quality (and we have eaten at many Relais and Chateaux). Overall, there are many hotels in Barcelona where you could have as good or better a stay for much less money.",3,2016,06,24
14,Not up to Relais and Chateaux standards-poor customer service,"We reserved a Junior Suite (500 euros) and requested ""upper floor with balcony.""  When we were shown our room it was on the first floor with no balcony (other than French balcony).  I told the man that it was not the room we requested and he said ""we put you here because it has a high ceiling and is at the rear of the hotel so quiet which we thought you would enjoy"".  It is not up to the hotel to decide what we would be happy with when we made a specific request.  I realize when you request a room, it is not guaranteed but this hotel was not full and when we said the room was not what we requested, we should have been changed.  There was no privacy screening whatsoever from neighbors across the VERY narrow street (I could watch their TV) so much of the time we had to keep the drapes closed which made the room very dark and depressing.  We had invited some friends from Switzerland to join us in Barcelona and recommended that they stay at your hotel which they did.  They reserved a (less expensive) Deluxe Room and were given an upper floor with a full balcony, screened from neighbors, with a seating area, loungers, and outside bath tub/shower.  We did not want to make a big scene with the hotel about our room because we were with friends and did not want to get confrontational with the hotel in their presence but again when I told the hotel we were not happy with the room we should have been moved.  

The amenities provided in the bathroom were soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion.  I called reception to ask where in the room I could find the other amenities as I needed a shower cap and some cotton swabs.  I was told they only provide that upon request.  Cheap!  The shower/tub looked nice but the grout was missing next to the enclosure so water channeled and ran down the granite-covered outside of the tub.  The area was rusted so clearly this was not a new issue.    We had to stuff a hand towel in that area to block the water to keep from having ½ inch of water pooled on the bathroom floor.

We did not eat at the restaurant because we were not impressed with the breakfasts.  The food set out was minimal (rolls, jams, croissants).  We were given a plate with a few pieces of fruit and slices of ham.  Again, clearly not up to R & C standards.  Service was very slow.  There was always one man and a young woman there.  He would say good morning when we arrived but it often took 5 minutes or more before anyone came over to offer coffee and we were never there when it was crowded so no excuse for the slowness when there are only 2 other tables occupied.

We ordered drinks many times in the bar with our friends and we never received so much as a potato chip with our drinks.  Throughout Spain you normally receive almonds, olives, or chips to accompany drinks.  It appears this hotel is really trying to economize every way they can which is really outrageous given the rates they are charging.

Our even bigger complaint about this hotel is the lack of training and knowledge of those on the front desk.  I asked to speak with the concierge and the woman sitting at the reception indicated she was the concierge as well as checking in, etc.  As it turned out, she had been in Barcelona 2 months so knew little about the area, transportation, activities, restaurants, etc.  There were 2 other women working that desk during our stay who both had ""Trainee"" badges.  They had been at the hotel 2 weeks.  We often received incorrect information from them.  We wasted 1/2 a day because of poor info provided about ticketing at Park Gruell.  I could go on and on about this hotel.  Why is a hotel of this category having trainees (not even from Spain) functioning as concierges?  I understand people have to learn on the job but there should be a trained staff member working with them directly.  In this case, when they could not answer a question, they would have to go behind a curtain and call someone else out to help them.  We eventually heard that there had been ""a mass exodus of experienced personnel"".  Surely Relais & Chateaux could have found trained replacements rather than bringing in university students (one woman told me she had to do 6 month hotel internship).  

One last thing, we had numerous emails back and forth with the hotel regarding our transfer to the airport.  A time was confirmed twice but the night before our departure, my husband checked with reception and they had the wrong time.  Big problems at this hotel!!",2,2016,06,14
14,What a place!,"Amazing hotel in the center of the Gothic neighborhood. Staff couldn't be friendlier. When you need them they are there, when you don't you feel like you are in your own home. Directed us to terrific restaurants in all price ranges and always got us the best table! Rooms are large and super modern/clean. The best! ",5,2016,06,09
14,Amazing,"I stayed here recently for three nights and I can honestly say that this is the best hotel I have ever been to. As soon as I stepped in to Hotel Neri I felt welcomed and relaxed. I had a deluxe room with terrace and it was absolutely gorgeous - didn't want to leave. I will definitely return next time I am in Barcelona, wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.",5,2016,06,04
14,Incredible,"This property was everything i had expected and more. Prior to coming to Barcelona we spent 3 weeks travelling around Russia, and our time in Barcelona was for relaxing. We had 4 nights at the Hotel Neri.

This property is simply divine. It is located in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona within walking distance to La Rambla. In my opinion, you do not want to be too close to La Rambla as it can get a bit seedy at night time, so this was the perfect distance away without being too far.

The rooms were massive, beautifully decorated and they had incredible attention to detail. We had breakfast everyday at the hotel and the selection was fantastic. They even served Churros if you wanted them (which we always did of course!).

Would stay here again if coming back to Barcelona.",5,2016,06,04
14,Amazing Property; Great Location,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel and overall we loved it. The location was great - right in the middle of the Gothic Quarter. The staff bent over backwards to be helpful - suggesting activities and dining options. I also liked the bathroom which was quite spacious. That said, our room  over-looked the back courtyard; although quaint when we arrived (on a weekend) we discovered on Monday that it was actually a school for small (loud) children. We returned to our room late in the day expecting to have some quiet time - but it was very noisy.  Also, the hotel boasts a lovely roof-top terrace - but the 2 times I went - I was asked to leave to accommodate a private party.  Still, all in all it was a good choice for our first visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,06,03
14,A 5 star hotel on a gothic street. A hidden gem.,"Hotel Neri is in the best location of the city, The hotel is sitting on a foundation from the second century. Inside it is beautiful. Our room was large and spotless. Every night the lobby had hot chocolate chip cookies served. The breakfast was lovely and the staff would give us fruit to take if we were going on an outing. I don't ever remember sleeping as soundly as I did at Hotel Neri. Rooftop patio outstanding with jasmine everywhere and hammocks to lie in and relax after a lot of rambling.",5,2016,06,03
14,Service needs improving,"We spent 6 nights at this hotel, which is situated in a small street close to the Cathedral.  It is a lovely old, characterful building and very well located.

We were received at reception and shown different aspects of the hotel and our room.  All good - although the bath is actually on the balcony, which we personally found a bit odd.  The housekeeping service in the room was very quick and efficient.  Everything was replenished, toiletries, water, milk, etc.  The laundry service was also excellent.

We had a booked a room in the hotel restaurant for our first night, 6 months prior to our arrival.  So we were very disappointed to find that we were not in the restaurant, but in the 'breakfast room' a small room with one other table, totally lacking in atmosphere.

Breakfast was included in our stay and was very good.  However, there were inconsistencies in the service we received.  

All the staff seemed to be very young and 'trainees' or with limited experience.  For example, one morning we requested tea cups in the room and also information about transport and costs to a specific venue.  We were told that this information would be provided to us.  However, after 24 hours neither the cups nor the information was forthcoming and we had to ask a second time.

At the time of leaving we were initially given someone else’s bill !

Although these are minor points, our general impression was that the young people who make up the staff are all very willing, keen, pleasant, but for a 5 star hotel, there seems to be very little management oversight.  We didn’t see anyone throughout our stay who we thought might be described as a manager or in a senior position.

I have sent these comments to the hotel manager, but as yet (several days later) have received no acknowledgement or response . . . which seems to be following the pattern.

Overall, our trip was really enjoyable, but we expect a bit more in terms of service from a 5 star Relais et Chateaux hotel.",4,2016,05,26
14,Birthday in Barcelona,"Tucked away on a tiny street in the Gothic quarter, This small boutique hotel was amazing!  This will go into history as one of our favorite rooms ever. Interesting decor, fabulous service from a small staff, and one of the best gin and tonics in Europe. Don't miss the hammocks on the rooftop terrace at night. Can't wait to go back!",5,2016,05,25
14,Great location and Old Town ambience,"The antithesis of high-rise Trumpism, Hotel Neri is hidden in one of the many ""alleys"" close to the Catedral.  Compact and quiet, the rooms are more spacious than many typical European rooms, but less spacious than you'd get at a luxury hotel.  The included breakfast was very good with adequate selection.  Staff was always available, professional and accommodating without being obsequious.  We regret not trying their highly-acclaimed restaurant as we opted for less formal/fine-dining options which are numerous.",5,2016,05,24
14,Perfect Hotel,"Excellent Hotel! Staff went above and beyond to accommodate our stay their dinner recommendations never led us wrong.  Rooms were nice, beds were very comfortable.  Restaurant and bar A+ Gothic part of town very close to Cathedral. Close to shopping and plent of sight seeing. ",5,2016,05,21
14,A unique hotel in the heart of Barri Gotic,"We thoroughly  enjoy our stay in this beautifully renovated old building in the center of Barri Gotic 'together with
the excellent service of the hotel s staff.We will certainly return to Hotel Neri in our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,05,16
14,"Gorgeous hotel, great location","Some people comment about how hard it is to find the hotel, but I didn't have any issues; just do a little homework on google maps before getting there. 

The hotel is just a short 2 min walk from the Cathedral of Barcelona, in a beautiful section of the gothic zone. The hotel entrance is always manned and you have to be buzzed in - which is nice for security. 

The hotel is super stylish and looks fantastic. I had a suite on the first floor -- which was well appointed and large even by american standards. The staff was friendly and always looking to help.

It is also a short walk to great coffee at Satan's coffee, or the Boqueria market. Also has really interesting shops around it in the gothic zone.

Great hotel.",5,2016,05,13
14,Outstanding Service and Ambiance,This is a small hotel located in the oldest section of Barcelona. The area is a warren of small streets and alleys with charming shops and restaurants at every turn. This was our first visit to Barcelona and we were absolutely delighted by the area and the hotel. The hotel contains an excellent restaurant and bar on the main level and a rooftop lounge area. We certainly would return.,5,2016,05,10
14,Totally outstanding experience,We absolutely loved this hotel! It has old world charm and is located very close to the cathedral and very convenient walking location in the city. The rooms are luxurious and the bathrooms were large and beautifully appointed. Our room was very comfortable. I gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 because we had trouble working the HVAC thermostat and we got a little warm at night. Don't wait to ask the management to explain how the thermostat works!,4,2016,05,09
14,Awesome!,"Great location, awesome rooms, great staff and service.  We stayed with our infant daughter and the hotel was super accommodating and the items they had for her - crib, tub, etc. - were perfect.  Love this place and highly recommend. ",5,2016,05,08
14,Relaxing Time in Barcelona,"Our second visit to this beautiful hotel was very well received . The first was 10 years ago,and there have been some structural changes,but it's just as good as we remember.
it's location is the Hotel's best asset, right next to the Cathedral in the Gothic area, ideal for exploring the area on foot.
The hotel itself is beautiful,and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. The bedroom was very comfortable and well equipped,and afforded a relaxing couple of nights. We did not use the restaurant, but did take in the breakfast, which was typically continental, so those with a larger appetite may wish to search elsewhere! 
The only small complaint, the pillows had ,for reasons unknown been sprayed with perfume, sounds romantic maybe, but it does not aid sleep! Otherwise, just about perfect! ",4,2016,05,05
14,A very special hotel,"A unique very special hotel offering quality accommodations, a wonderful staff, and the best food we had in our 20 day tour of Portugal and Spain. In a great location for experiencing the history of Barcelona with nearby dining  and shopping. The Gaudi tourist sites are easily reached by by public transportation or taxi .  It added significantly to a our great Barcelona experience that will be fondly remembered.",5,2016,05,03
14,Charming comfort in the Gothic,"We visit Barcelona often and always wanted to try the Neri.  It is an absolutely deligtful place.  Our room was comfortable and calming and the best part, it had a bathtub!!  Beautiful linens, towels and details.  The palacio that houses the Neri is stunning and the roof terrace makes one feel as if you are in a beautiful garden in the middle of the city.  Our only reservation about giving it an excellent was the restaurant, which was not up to the standard of a Relais and Chateaux property.  The location cannot be beat for being in the heart of historic Barcelona.",4,2016,05,02
14,Autumn in Barcelona ,"Stunning boutique hotel in heart of gothic area in Barcelona.  Very short distance from cathedral.  Lovely streets with good shopping, restaurants and bars. The hotel has its own restaurant.  Room was clean, modern very comfortable and two balconies. Room on second floor and I found it quiet.  Staff on front desk were extremely helpful. Would love to return. ",5,2016,05,01
14,Perfect boutique hotel experience in Barcelona,Beautiful interior and superior customer service. We were a group of 7 from the US in Barcelona for a few days. The concierge was incredibly helpful for us as well. The location is a quiet alley in a really neat area of the city where you can walk anywhere. Suggest requesting a room not on the square side as they can get a little loud.,5,2016,04,27
14,"Location, location, location","The Neri Hotel enjoys an exceptional location in the Barri Gothic section of town, which meant we could walk to many great sites; however, the location means that the rooms are noisy. We recommend upgrading to a room with a terrace since the rooms are small. We also recommend the restaurant, which has wonderful service and great food.",4,2016,04,25
14,Great boutique hotel in the shadow of the Cathedral,"Very hard to fault the experience in this delightful small property tucked away in the alleyways of the Gothic Quarter, the original Jewish centre of Barcelona. Service,food and rooms are of a high order. The staff are particularly notable for their friendly professionalism and are helpful in every way without being intrusive; a rare art. In general, we found the food around Barcelona is so so but not in the hotel. By the way, a guided tour of the city and into La Familia is essential and not to be missed. Don't just rock up and expect to get in.",5,2016,04,25
14,Great luxury boutique hotel ,Located in the Gothic quarter this boutique hotel is a little gem . Mind you this kind of luxury do not come cheap ! The hotel has an amazing roof terrace where you can relax after a day sightseeing in Barcelona. The restaurant in the hotel had a Michelin star but honestly we did not go . ,5,2016,04,24
14,Small and out of the way,"Really nice, expensive, small hotel. Breakfast was included ( very nice,) and we could walk almost everywhere. You are I the Gothic quarter which is very cool. The hotel helped us set up a private tour which was outstanding..",4,2016,04,23
14,Hotel Neri Barcelona,"A great boutique hotel in the "" gothic"" area. Expensive, however worth the understated contemporary elegance . Staff excellent. There to help you when needed and unobtrusive when not. 
Many eating options in the vicinity and close to Underground trains and buses ( download the Barcelona MBT app as well as pocket earth ). Our room surprisingly fairly warm at night and you may need the air con( street noise if you leave the window open). 
I stayed 4 nights and would certainly return . ",5,2016,04,20
14,"Great place, great location!","We chose this boutique hotel based on ratings and info on TripAdvisor and other sites.  What a great choice!  Only 22 rooms so book early if you want to stay here.  Staff was great, extremely helpful and unfailingly nice.  Room was a tad small, as you would expect, but nicely furnished and all linens, amenities, etc., were superb.  The gothic quarter location is wonderful to get a full dose of historic Barcelona.  Highly recommended.  ",5,2016,04,15
14,Wonderful Stay in the Gothic Quarter,"We were met at the airport by a driver arranged by the Neri that drove us to the hotel through ever-narrowing streets with grace, aplomb, and humor. On reaching the street where the Neri is located the driver pulled in the side mirrors and backed to the entrance. (Yes, that's how narrow the street is.) 

We were met at the front entrance by gracious, helpful staff members. We arrived in Barcelona somewhat early due to our flight and our room was not yet prepared but the staff checked our bags and we were free to roam around for an hour or so.

When we returned from our ramble we finalized our check in and went up to our room where our bags were waiting. The room itself was elegant and spacious (for a European hotel room). The amenities were plentiful and of the highest quality. The bathroom was beautifully designed and very clean. A roomy terrace with two chairs and a table was located just outside a large glass door. 

Everything about the property was of the highest standards. Staff were always courteous and helpful.

I would highly recommend the Neri to anyone bound for Barcelona.",5,2016,04,08
14,Splendid Property in the Core of the Barri Gòtic,"All I have to say is ""what a surprise!""  The Hotel Neri was an oasis after exploring the many corridors, passageways, and alleys of the Gothic Quarter.  You suddenly turned the corner and ""poof"" you go from the cold hard exterior surfaces to the warm ""I'm home"" feeling of Neri.  While built upon ancient foundations, the inside is absolutely inviting and the service from the 'entire' staff is impeccable.  I mean, where else can you get a choice of pillow fillings or a thread count preference on your sheets?

Beyond that, you're in a phenomenal location.  A 10 minute walk to the waterfront.  A 5 minute walk to the nearest (two) Metro stations to whisk you anywhere.  A few minute walk to the Cathedral.  It's a great spot to immerse yourself in the real Barcelona.

My room was very quiet although during the day you could pick up noise from the nearby school that shared the courtyard behind.  Something to ask about.

I'd say my only complaint (but not enough to shift my overall rating) is the lack of good Wi-Fi speeds.  For a 5-star property, they could use a little time with a network engineer.  There's no reason my cellular network should be faster and less latent than a hard line.

Oh, and lastly, make sure you make the trek to the rooftop for a second oasis of tranquility.  We went at night to enjoy the lighting but I can imagine a packed house in the sunshine easily.

Great property.  If you can see the value proposition in the cost (there's no getting around it's a 5-star hotel), go for it.  You won't be disappointed!",5,2016,04,04
14,Amazing property in the heart of Barcelonas ancient city,"Hotel Neri is a small gem tucked away in the city center of Barcelona very close to the Cathedral. The hotel has a fantastic atmosphere of quiet relaxing luxury that is the perfect frame for a romantic or family vacation.

The staff is very friendly and speaks good English. They are very happy to help with e.g. organizing tickets or other forms of reservation. 

The hotel restaurant is also very good, and if the weather is nice the rooftop bar is a good place to relax.",5,2016,04,02
14,First Class!,"It is a pleasure to submit this review...perfect location, a lovely, period building tastefully updated, excellent restaurant and absolutely superb, friendly staff.  Overall, an enthusiastic ""A+"" (from a very tough grader)!!  

(internet speed could be better, but I doubt this is within control of the hotel so no deductions)",5,2016,04,01
14,Twist my arm...and I might tell,"I'm a fan. I'm a Hotel Neri fan - as simple as that. 

To be honest I felt totally smug and didn't really want to tell anyone about this fantastic gem in the hear of the Gothic town of Barcelona. Granted its a 5 star hotel, so of course it was supposed to be great BUT as a frequent traveller and working within the interior business I have tough skin...what I adored the most about Neri was that I truly had that wonderful experience on feeling that ""home, away from home"" - feeling. This is something you only feel when they've got that extra special thing going on. And they had and they did. Service was wonderful, staff excellent, atmosphere brilliant and location perfect. So to cut a long story short. Yes, I will be back and yes I AM A NERI FAN <3",5,2016,03,25
14,Hidden Gem,"This Hidden Gem is situated in the old Gothic Quarter and is an amazing find ... Outstanding customer service, immaculate and creative interior... Beautiful aroma of scented candles and freshly cut flowers throughout, Very special place that stay.. would strongly recommend.",5,2016,03,21
14,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful location","I booked this hotel for my husband and teenage daughter's dad/daughter trip. They loved it. My husband, who has stayed in properties all over the world, said this was one of the best properties he's ever stayed in - room, bed, shower, location,staff, restaurant, everything top notch. 

For families traveling together, recommend rooms 102 and 103, a nice connecting set of rooms overlooking the square. Though the square is lively and can be noisy, my husband loved the character and found it to be charming, not at all off putting. I did a lot of research before organizing their trip to Spain and all the places they stayed and vendors they used I've given top marks in my reviews. This is not because I'm necessarily easy to please, it is because the highly rated organizations lived up to their reputations!",5,2016,03,20
14,Perfect location and wonderful service,An amazing spot in the gothic quarter. We loved our rooms -- old and new blended perfectly. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The bar is also wonderful -- lovely place to sit. Easy access to main areas of gothic quarter.,5,2016,03,19
14,Revisiting Barcelona,Excellent location in Gothic District (once you have found it)! Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms clean with great shower. Added bonus of small roof terrace providing some welcome outdoor space to relax and have drinks.,5,2016,03,19
14,A Pearl in the Gothic Distrit,"Like a hidden gem, the Neri is nearly concealed in the labyrinth known as the Gothic District. But what a find! Upon entering the quiet, aromatic lobby, you are personally greeted by a friendly staff member. Old architectural details and modern décor are  illuminated by the unusual lighting. Sleeping rooms are spacious - loved the high ceilings -  and the bathrooms have contemporary fixtures. Lots of storage for suitcases, etc. The furniture ""sculpture"" in the first floor landing adds a bit of fun and whimsy for both children and adults.  Be sure to go to the 4th floor terrace and take advantage of the outdoor tables/chairs or the  two hammocks there - they provide a great view of the pigeons roosting on the rooftop across the way.   Loved it!  ",5,2016,03,17
14,An old hotel full with young ideas,"Not easy to reach in the gothic centre of Barcelona, this hotel was an ideal starting point to explore the old city. A young and friendly staff and modern and practical furnishings were the outstanding plus points. Difficult to find any minus points.",5,2016,03,14
14,Fantastic service. Small and very quiet at night.,"This gem is in the heart of the Gothic district, close to the metro, restaurants, and shops. The staff were very friendly and were multilingual. The area felt safe and was quiet at night. Wi-fi wasn't great, but it was good enough.",5,2016,03,03
14,Exceptional Experience,Hotel Neri made my visit to Barcelona an exceptional experience. The staff was warm and welcoming assuring that our needs were addressed in a timely manner with the highest of quality. Amenities were comfortable and the location in the heart of the Gothic District simplified access to the city.,5,2016,03,02
14,almost heaven!,old building that has been recently totally renovated. In a narrow alley filled with unique shops. 5 star design and execution of the renovation. Some terrific restaurants in walking distance (Vianna). Staff very helpful. Coming back here again for sure.,5,2016,03,02
14,Beatiful experience in Barcelona,"The Hotel is wonderfuly located in the Gothic area of Barcelona at a walking distance of the main atractions
The Hotel is nice, the rooms are silent, confortable and clean.
The staff is very kind.
Brakfast is very good and offers local and international dishes.",5,2016,03,02
14,A Great Hotel in Barcelona,"This is a cozy little hotel in a great location within the Jewish Quarter, only steps away from so much you want to see in Barcelona - the Cathedral de Barcelona, Las Ramblas,  the Born neighborhood and much more. They have a spectacular breakfast and excellent service.  Even though it could be loud at times during the day, the noise was never apparent at night.  Definitely a place to consider staying during a trip to Barcelona.",5,2016,03,02
14,Still Great,"We have been staying at the Hotel Neri for five years and it gets better each year.  Our stay last week was no exception.  The location, the staff, the food, the ambiance, and the room were all wonderful.  It is a great place to call home when you visit Barcelona!",5,2016,03,02
14,Exceptional Boutique Hotel!!,"Myself and my partner had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Neri at the end of January and our expectations were completely surpassed! The online pictures of this little gem really do not do it enough justice. Modernism meets pure historic elegance! Exceptional attention to detail with the interior decor.Everything from the candlelit reception, the hotel scent  to the surfacing on the elevators added to what can only be described as a wonderfully charming and romantic stay. The staff were very accommodating and friendly, even providing us with an ipad and some phone charges for work we had to do. Our room overlooked the Plaza Sant Felip Neri, in the evening we could hear amazing local acoustic musicians playing through our balcony doors, it was beautiful. The roof terrace was also a favourite of ours. To top it off the hotel location is perfect, right in the centre of the Gothic Quarter. We would definitely recommend this hotel if planning a trip to Barcelona and we are already planning our next visit!.",5,2016,03,02
14,Outstanding,"This is a spectacular hotel located just off the main square in old town. The staff is sensational, the room is well appointed and the bathrooms are very large. Make sure to get a balcony room and enjoy the hammock! The restaurant and bar are very nice as well.",5,2016,02,13
14,Very Happy Place,"You might first feel mild annoyance because this hotel is tucked away, in the old feudal part of town, and you must walk 200 yards or so, along cobblestones, past the Cathedral, to reach the hotel's modern-glass front door. But once checked in, you will see -- and I have been returning now for 6 years -- that it is a restful oasis, very modern set in an ancient structure, with a friendly feel and, most memorable of all, a small dining room that has no compare. Barcelona is an urban wonder-of-the-world,  and people everywhere talk about it, and not surprisingly 12 or 15 Barcelona and Catalan dining rooms compete to be best, but several times I have brought guests to this hotel for dinner and the guests -- years after -- continue to describe it as one of the most memorable meals of a lifetime. The dinners are what almost anyone would call ""modern"", ""innovative"", and ""visually stunning,"" as well as delicious, in an environment that is friendly and informal, with none of the 1950's haughtiness of  many European Michelin-starred dining rooms. Only the Connaught in London is as wonderful. I love this hotel,",5,2016,02,09
14,Lovely terrace,Lovely bar terrace upstairs and inside bar they even have a little plaza in the back with some interesting history. The hotel its self looks darling I believe it was a Chateaux. Staff was awesome as well! Stop by and have a drink or two upstairs or downstairs. ,5,2016,02,07
14,"Excellent place, great service.","We extremely enjoyed our stay. Great service, super nice staff, wonderfully private, cosy atmosphere. We were upgraded to a junior suite with a nice view onto an antique courtyard. Even though th ehotel is right in the heart of the bari gotic, it is very quiet. Very tasty breakfast, most obliging waiter. Would come back there anytime.",5,2016,01,26
14,Boutique hotel in Barri Gotic,"We (family of four with two teenage boys) spent 5 nights at Hotel Neri and had a wonderful stay. We took two 'interconnecting' rooms - classic or standard room (with an excellent rainforest shower stall and two twin beds overlooking St Philipe Neri square) and a deluxe room (corner room with a nice bath tub and queen bed). These two rooms had a common area (4' x 6') with an additional door to make it a private area for us. Our rooms were in the first floor (2nd floor by American standards) - rooms 102 and 103. Theres stairs from the main lobby to 2nd floor or you can use the elevator too. Beds were comfortable (can easily accommodate a 6 footer) and towels were high quality. 
Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Hotel staff were very helpful and ready to assist when we asked for anything. They all speak fluent English - communication was not a problem. Right from the time we made initial inquiry and through our stay, the staff was very friendly. They even sent us a reminder a week in advance and an online check-in notice a day ahead with our preferences.
Breakfast was served every morning in the library - includes an an excellent spread of bread, fruits, ham and freshly made pancakes or eggs (based on our request). 
Hotel is very centrally located with an easy 2-3 min walk to the Cathedral or San Jaume square, 5-6 min walk to Las Ramblas, 8-10 min walk to Picasso Museum. Being in the Gothic quarter and based on previous reviews, we ordered an airport pickup prior to our arrival - which was very helpful. Lot of good places to eat nearby. We had only one lunch at the Hotel Neri, which was good. There's an excellent freshly ground coffee shop nearby as well on Llibreteria (off San Jaume square) and a gelato shop on the side street next to the hotel.
As others have said earlier, there's a kindergarten/private school on the square. Children playing in the square during recess did not bother us. Most days, we were out, sight seeing. In the weekends, you can hear people on the street below around 1 or 2 AM. Again, this did not bother us, it was part of the ambience... 
For FC Barcelona futbol fans, hotel does arrange tickets. Also, there's a FC Barcelona store (FCBotiga) near San Jaume square (3-4 min from the hotel) where you can get official gear and tickets, if needed. They offer shirt printing services of your favorite player...
Overall, an excellent stay in this well designed hotel, mix of history and modern comforts. We are very glad we chose this hotel!",5,2016,01,23
14,Great hotel with a great staff,"Stayed for one day before a cruise and three days after. Beautiful old world charm with all the modern amenities. Delicious breakfast and nice lounge/dining room overlooking the small plaza. Conveniently located near the Cathedral. The staff is very helpful with tours, directions and transfers.",5,2016,01,18
14,Top Marks to the Neri Hotel-LOVED IT!!,"First time to Barcelona. Booked this hotel as it's Relais & Chateaux & we had stayed at the Wickanninish Inn on Vancouver Island in May which is also R&C & we had been so impressed. You couldn't get a more central atmospherically located hotel. Don't be put off by other reviews which say if you have a suite overlooking the square at the rear of the hotel you will be disturbed by the children's school. You will be out & about when they are at play. If you're going to stay in your room all day, ok, you will hear the kids. We were on the 3rd floor & loved having the window open to hear the guy playing his guitar in the evening by the fountain. Very stylish small hotel in the public areas & the suite. At breakfast they bring you a fab platter of meats etc which would be enough, but you can also order something hot & there are pastries too. Sets you up for the day. Deeelish homemade cookies available in reception all day long-I had too many! Restaurant is quite fish orientated which isn't for us, but nice to have a drinkie or two in the bar or outside in the square. Also has a roof garden which is quite delightful & we sat up there late afternoons resting our weary feet & you can order drinks from the bar which they bring up to you. Really nice staff, always friendly apart from one pompous young chap on reception. Loved the festive jumpers & t-shirts the staff wore in the run up to Xmas. Hotel is in the Gothic quarter & we loved the atmospheric quant streets full of history. Barcelona promotes Las Ramblas which we HATED, no atmosphere at all. there's a fab local restaurant just along from the Neri. Tiny & doesn't look much, but we had the lunch special which was yummy & included wine. We weren't at all impressed by the restaurant on the lane which comes off the main square & leads to the street the Neri was on. Looks appealing from the outside, but good disappointing.",5,2016,01,10
14,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Like all of the Château and relay experiences, this is yet another beautiful and perfect space and location.  Upon our arrival the staff was attentive and very helpful offering us a glass of wine upon our entry. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms are spacious. We slept very well in the gorgeous comfortable bedding. The hotel is located in the Gothic district right next to a popular  Square, which makes it easy to find due to its location within the labyrinth of the old Gothic area. It is perfect walking distance to the born area and Las ramblas.  The restaurant was delicious, and the breakfast that is included in the room fee was also wonderful. I highly recommend this hotel for a very traditional and pampered Barcelona Experience.",5,2016,01,07
14,Unbelievably Perfect,"The Hotel Neri anticipates what you want, before you can even think to ask.We spent a delightful three nights as this hotel and were constantly amazed. We traveled with another couple and our seven pound dog. Not only was everyone dog-friendly, they were dog-welcoming! The location is ideal, the decor a perfect blend of old and new, the food wonderful and the staff impeccable.Truly a hidden gem!",5,2016,01,06
14,A one night stay in historic Barcelona,"Admittedly not the easiest hotel to find but what a gem! We couldn't have wished for a better located hotel in the historic quarter of the city within a few metres of the cathedral. A charming boutique style ancient and small property but with spacious, well appointed although some might say minimalistic rooms. An excellent breakfast and good value (but not advertised) tasting evening dinner topped off an excellent stay.",5,2016,01,06
14,Gothic experience,"The Neri Hotel, as part of the Relais & Chateaux Brand Network, lives up to its standards. We loved the location, the service provided and the property itself (architectural design, space distribution, decoration and rooms) is so very well integrated. It definitely has the Gothic character and ambience.",5,2015,12,28
14,Excellent small hotel in the Gothic quarter.,"The Hotel Neri is perfectly located in the heart of the Gothic quarter a short walk to the Cathedral, restaurants and shops in the Born. it is one of the only high quality boutique hotels in this area of Barcelona. The staff was super handling all our requests.  We visited with another couple for 4 nights. our rooms were on the 3rd floor overlooking the courtyard. We had a great stay a couple of weeks before Christmas. we definitely would return.",5,2015,12,26
14,Romantic weekend,"We spent a wonderful, romantic 3 days in the heart of historic Barcelona. Every aspect of the hotel was impecccable. A special shout out to the staff who were gracious and attentive. Lives up to the Relais and Chateaux standard and then some.",5,2015,12,24
14,Secretly begs me to comeback...,"I travel a lot and the worst part is, I don't journal it enough and often I forget to review it on TripAdvisor--which is bad on me because TripAdvisor is my go-to site to help guide me on future adventures...In 2015 I had +160 hotels nights and I know I should leave some input too...so this is in regards to our stay at Hotel Neri in November 2014--wasn't my first time in Barcelona or second but it was the BEST hotel that is still beckoning me back--as well as the City.  Definitely use their front desk arranged driver to meet you at the train or airport to bring you in---the Gothic area can be tricky for a taxi or uber driver not sure where to 'drop' you because its not exactly at the front door (you are forewarned! watch the number of bags you have cuz ya gotta schlep them baby) but it is sooo worth it. It is in the heart of the Gothic Quarter which I wasn't sure would work out but hands down I am so glad we did. We could walk everywhere easily using our iPhone GPS; in the evening it quieted down and you felt the neighboring buildings come alive with families adjacent--yes during the day on the court side there is a school of rambunctious school children (their playground is actually on an adjacent roof, eye level to the rooms at the 3rd and 4th floor level) but I loved the neighborhood ambience we got from it. I felt very safe walking around day and night; the City had daily cleaners sweeping and washing the brick walkways (quite impressive since there wasn't an immediate need to clean anything--) keeping the experience of just being there pleasant. The breakfast each morning was pleasant and the sitting room cozy and elegant. Concierge and front desk were helpful beyond belief on suggestions, printing concert tickets (yes go to a local church evening performance--breathtaking), arranging taxis and tours.  2015 had me all over the world and as I calendar in 2016, hoping to return to Barcelona and Hotel Neri.  Oh and the bathroom amenities were awesome as was the unique design and the room was well laid out and stylish.",5,2015,12,20
14,Fantastic Hotel!,"Loved Hotel Neri, everything from check in to check out.  Front desk staff was great - warm and friendly, very helpful planning events of the day.  I found the staff to be exceptionally professional in a natural kind of way.

The entrence was great, big doors, candles lit inside.  Lobby clean, comfortable and welcoming.  Restaurant very very good.  I had scallops, octopus, foie gras, salmon, potatoes. All great. Breakfast also very good, coffee-espresso-juice-danish-ect.

Room very nice with big windows, comfy bed and great lighting.

Hope to be back.",5,2015,12,16
14,Exceptionally exquisite!,"Fantastic location, room & staff that made our stay feel like a truly personal experience.  The room was stylish, airy and tastefully appointed and all the staff went out of their way to help, nothing was too much trouble, without being in your face.",5,2015,12,16
14,Historic hotel with part-time student staff,"After visiting Barcelona for the second time I realized how hopeless the staff were at Neri. They weren't able to book me museum tickets because technical IT issues. Add to that, I missed so all the restaurant and tapas scene, because most of the staff were interns from abroad. This is not a typical device of Relaix & Chateaux, I have stayed at many. This one I was disappointed with.",1,2015,12,14
14,It was really great time in Barcelona,It is really great hotel with very friendly staff and beautiful rooms. Prior my visit I had red some comments on TripAdvisor and honestly after a great weekend spent there I have  realized there are still some people they should not travel at all... the complains that there is no taxi service that brings you in front of the doors or the matter of fact it is just few stops from next building across the street is really stupid and shows an intelligence of some travellers who stayed in this hotel before. If someone choose this beautiful hotel in the middle of the gothic part of town he should expect such an “inconvenience”. I have travelled really many different countries and it was my 20th visit to Barcelona. However I have to say it was my BEST one because of the hotel NERI.,5,2015,12,08
14,Wonderful boutique hotel.,"Attentive and helpful staff.Very useful suggestions re tourist activities 
Looked after bookings etc
Maps and local directions needed given maze of streets

Breakfast was good although a bit pricy considering options elsewhere

Pampered our entire stay
Will return",5,2015,12,07
14,Long Weekend,"Lovely hotel, good staff. An atmosphere of peace and unhurried efficiency. The Gothic Quarter can be noisy with sound echoing round the narrow alleyways but I think this hotel is situated better than most.",5,2015,12,07
14,Great hotel and location ,Comfortable hotel located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Close to everything we did. Had a nice room overlooking the small Neri square. Free WiFi really helped with planning our days. Plan ahead with tours as things get booked up quickly even in low season.,5,2015,12,05
14,Great spot in the historic interesting part of the city,"Really liked this character filled hotel located in the old historic part of the city, the room was comfortable and the lovely bathroom was tiled in stone, quiet position (there was a renovation happening across the lane but that would be only temporary).  Although in a small lane the taxi still came to the front door of the hotel.  The breakfast room was delightful.  Reception staff were super helpful and we appreciated them helping us with tours etc.  Lots of interesting shops and tapas restaurants nearby.",5,2015,12,02
14,Expectations Surpast,"My wife and I fell in love with this hotel. The unique building, the location, the rooftop lounge, the cleanliness, the staff's attention to details; all were incredible. My wife's birthday occurred while we were there and, without us saying anything, the kitchen made a chocolate cake that the staff insisted on presenting her before we checked out...at breakfast. Of special note, all the front desk/concierge people provided excellent information including helping us find neighborhood festivals with castellering.",5,2015,12,02
14,Great location and a hip place to stay,"Neri is a gem with wonderful staff, cool lobby, dining room and lovely rooms.  The attention we were given elevates the Neri to a true Relais & Chateaux property. My only suggestion will be to correct the Wi-Fi as it needs improvement.  The bathroom amenities are nice. Safe a bit complicated to use.",5,2015,11,30
14,"Absolutely love this hotel, the service, the ambience, everything!","This was one of the best experiences I have ever had in a hotel. Definitely 5 star for service, amenities, décor, location and the bar was terrific for food and drink. We had a junior suite and I would get it again, it was a large room although the hotel is small and I felt like I had a new home. Comfortable and pretty. The service was excellent and we were welcomed warmly. Easy to walk for the sites and shopping.",5,2015,11,29
14,"Great hotel, perfect location","Located in the Gothic quarter, this hotel was fabulous.  We loved everything--location, architecture, service, the room, the staff, breakfast.  Our room was not ready when we arrived, so the concierge gave us a glass of Cava while he explained the city map.  A very luxurious hotel with unassuming style.",5,2015,11,28
14,Gem of a hotel in the heart of the Gothic Quarter,"We recently spent 2 nights at this gorgeous hotel in the Gothic quarter. The staff were extremely courteous and helpful. The ambience is lovely and our room was very spacious especially by European standards. The hotel's location could not be better, although there is a school (in a beautiful old building!) very close by so there is some noise at collection time. I recommend taking breakfast in your package as most of the restaurants and cafes in the area only open around 11am.",5,2015,11,26
14,"High standards - top to bottom, and Service, Service, Service!!","Located in the Barri Gotic, one of the oldest and most fascinating areas of the city, the Neri reflects its past but incorporates modern decor and amenities.The staff, from the front desk, to the dining room, the bar, the kitchen and housekeeping, are friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. They work well as a team in meeting all requests and needs of their guests and reflect the style of their city, the hotel, and the Relais and Chateaux group.",5,2015,11,24
14,Trip Barcelona,"Very nice little hotel with very friendly people and service. Great room (junior suite) and excellent breakfast. Gotic style inside and outside.

1 minor is a lot of noise during the night because of the small streets.",4,2015,11,24
14,Charming,"This is a boutique hotel in the old section of Barcelona. Views are very restricted because of the narrow streets----part of the charm. Walk to many of the interesting sites-- Gaudi archetcture, Picasso museum and high end shopping. Sophisticated small dining area for morning breakfast with excellent service. I can't comment on the dining room as we ate out at wine & Tapas  bars and every meal in the area was good. The concierge was very helpful arranging for a guided tour of the city and car service.",4,2015,11,23
14,Perfect location,My daughter and I were doing a trip and stopping in Barcelona for a few days.  We wanted to be in a location where it was easy to walk to a lot of the interesting areas and not too far from some of the Gaudi homes and the Cathedral.  This hotel is small but absolutely charming and the staff were very welcoming.  We got two rooms with a little connecting vestibule area that worked perfectly for us.  All the recommendations from the staff for restaurants and a driver to bring us from the airport were excellent. Would definitely stay here again if in Barcelona.,5,2015,11,23
14,Worth it,"If you're doing what I did before going to Barcelona, and you've just spent the last hour  comparing hotels and trying to decide where to stay, I recommend your search end here... The place is as beautiful as the pictures, the staff is accommodating and professional, the location sits on a national landmark, I don't think theres a better place in all Barcelona...",5,2015,11,23
14,Beautiful restored building in a perfect location,"Hotel is small and intimate.  Restaurant sits on a courtyard which is nice for evening cocktails etc.
Service could be a bit more attentive in the restaurant.  Fish was basically raw, had to send it back. Obviously the chef was not pleased and we were basically ignored for our dessert, which we cancelled.  That was the only thing, and really there are lots of great restaurants all around the hotel, so go out.
Breakfast is very nice, and great selection.",5,2015,11,23
14,"Just a quick overnight in Barcelona, but the location and support by the staff made it perfect.","Definitely save room for dinner - spectacular food, and surprisingly reasonable given the quality and service. Good wine list, too. Ask for suggestions for local wines, you won't be disappointed. Also don't forget to have a glass of wine up on the roof-top.",5,2015,11,23
14,We loved this hotel!,"Cozy, great lobby, comfortable beds, great restaurant, fantastic location! We loved staying at this hotel! The staff at the front desk were fantastic.  We will definitely stay here next time we are in Barcelona!",5,2015,11,21
14,"Beautifully appointed rooms, comfortable beds and unique bathrooms","The rooms were very comfortable and spacious.  The bathrooms were gorgeous.  The service fantastic and attentive.  Must check out rooftop lounge.  It smells so lovely throughout the hotel.  Cappuccinos were awesome.  Construction in the city near the hotel made the mornings a bit noisy, but with the overhead fan it does drown out the noise.",4,2015,11,21
14,Great location and public spaces,My fiance and I stayed at the Neri during a 3 night trip to Barcelona.  We loved the public spaces - partly ruins - and the location was perfect for walking to restaurants and shops in the Gothic Quarter.  The rooms were fair - more like a motel than a Relais and Chateaux.  Note that you can not access the hotel directly from the street as it is located down a narrow street.,4,2015,11,19
14,Perfect location near Las Ramblas,"Beautiful boutique hotel two blocks from Las Ramblas, the market, great shopping and the cruise ships.  Would suggest a room on the upper floor front for privacy. There is a primary school behind the hotel which is a bit noisy during the day but very quiet at night.  We rather enjoyed the voices of the children during the day.  The concierge was excellent with regard to general knowledge and recommendations.",5,2015,11,17
14,Good hotel in the perfect location,"Important - use a car service arranged by the hotel.  Hotel Neri is located in the old Gothic Quarter, a 12th century Roman city, which means one way streets and very narrow streets.  Even an experienced driver had to be very careful making the turns, sometimes needing multiple attempts to successfully navigate a corner.  If you use your own transportation you may end up walking a couple of blocks with all your luggage.  Once you get there, Hotel Neri is located close to historical buildings, the cathedral, fine shopping, and dining.  We never walked more than a few hundred yards for excellent dining eating at a different restaurant every night and never getting a bad meal.  The Hotel has been modernized with large rooms, good electrical outlets, plenty of lighting, and all the amenities of a five star hotel.  Some noise at night with the windows open due to street ""traffic"" (people walking to and from dinner).  If we come back to Barcelona, we will return to Hotel Neri.",5,2015,11,16
14,Honeymoon suite,"Favorite hotel in Barcelona. Love the contrast of old and modern. Distreet front door. Spent 2 nights there on our honeymoon. Great Bari Gotic location.
Framed the event with Catalonian style.
This back in June 2005.",5,2015,11,15
14,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Recommended by our travel agent, it was a lovely find.  We had a large room with a large bathroom, wonderful bed linens and ample closet space.  Our room was on the back of the hotel and overlooked a courtyard.  On our first day we found that there was a school on the other side of the courtyard and in the early part of the day and recess and end of the school day it could be quite noisy, but we are grandparents and enjoyed hearing the children at play (even with the screaming that they do). We were on the 3rd floor, so it was not too bad.  I don't know if they have any rooms that are more accessible, but it was difficult for my husband, with mild Parkinson's to get in and out of the tub/shower.  Lovely place, lovely setting, I would stay there again  Great Breakfast!",5,2015,11,12
14,One of the weirdest room rate calculations I've ever experienced !!!,"Charming, yes; nice staff; okay room; ample bathroom facilities BUT one of the screwiest - weird room rate calculations I've ever experienced in my life.  I booked three nights at one rate for each night, then upon check-out, was presented with THREE different rates for the three nights --- all dependent on how occupied the hotel had been while staying there.   Very cockeyed way of determining lodging costs.  Be prepared for other quirks ………….",2,2015,11,03
14,Great boutique hotel located in the beautiful Gothic Quarter,"The Neri is tucked away amongst a maze of medieval passageways* in the Gothic Quarter.  It is a combination of 2 buildings: 12th century and 18th century.  The result is a luxurious retreat that provides every comfort.

The rooms are spacious and well appointed with king size beds that provide a very good nights sleep. (At night, it is very quiet.  During the day, it can be noisy as there is a school in the courtyard behind the property.)
The bathrooms are nothing short of glamorous with fat, fluffy towels and lovely amenities. 
Breakfast is delicious with options of both Continental and full English.
The dining room and bar at the back of the hotel have a wonderful ambience in the evening.  There are tables set up in the courtyard should al fresco dining be desired.
The wifi is very fast.
And above all, the staff is very attentive and could not be more helpful.

*One thing to note about the location is the difficulty taxis have in reaching the hotel because of the narrow laneways. Both arriving and departing meant carrying/pulling our luggage between 1-3 streets away.  It didn't worry us - in fact, it added to the experience - but it may put off some.

We would happily stay at The Hotel Neri again should our travels take us back to Barcelona.",5,2015,11,02
14,Our favourite Barcelona hotel,"I fell in love with the Hotel Neri my first visit to Barcelona when I was wandering around the gothic quarter on my own.  I finally was able to bring my wife along and we celebrated our anniversary in room 306.  A bottle of champagne was waiting for us.  We had the gourmet tasting menu in the courtyard the first night - it was great.  You have to eat outside and just people watch.  The rooftop bar is also really nice.  Great for pigeon watching and drinking wine.  All in all, it's a perfect home-base for exploring Barcelona.",5,2015,11,02
14,Great location to visit main attractions and for shopping; a perfect option for short stays.  Exceptional staff.,"I write regularly for TA and always try to identify staff that go way beyond to make one's stay memorable and perfect.  At check-in I was greeted by Miguel, one of the front desk clerks.  I can say that he has to be one of the most professional, elegant, kind, and charming hoteliers I have ever encountered.  The check in process was smooth and the room assigned was excellent.  I accompanied a friend for a weekend and we both loved it.  I was impressed that Miguel actually asked when he saw us later in the day if we were pleased with our room and if he could assist in any other way; that is the type of service and attention one would expect at any fine hote.  It is evident that the training provided by hotel management is excellent although I am certain that this staff member must have graduated from one of the top European hospitality programs; he was that good. Ask for him when you check in.  

The location of this hotel is excellent for anyone who has a few days in Barcelona and wants to see As many of its top attractions and do some shopping as well.   The hotel is in the Gothic Quarter near the massive Corte Ingles Department store on Placa Catalunya at the end of Las  Ramblas.  This is Spain's equivalent of Macy's except better in that the prices are more reasonably, better variety and an impressive super market and gourmet food store in the basement.  And if you bring your passport you will get 10% bonus points on your purchases and the forms you need to,process a VAT tax refund at the airport when you leave the EU.

If you like the water, the hotel is also a short walk to the  harbor, making it an Ideal hotel if you are cruising out of Barcelona and want just a few days in the city before or after your cruise. And being in the Gothic Quarter it is near the impressive and massive Cathedral which you cannot miss. 

The beds are of very high quality as are the towels and bed linens and the rooms are spacious, especially considering hotel rooms in Europe.  It is a small hotel so book early and reconfirm your reservation to avoid any disappointment.  Our experience was faultless.  We will return again and hope that we are again greeted by Miguel at the front desk.  That will assure me that once again our stay will be memorable and perfect.",5,2015,10,26
14,Hotel Neri - Bummer!,"Months in advance we had booked the Hotel Neri to spend a few days in Barcelona at the end of a 10-day cruise. The day before we left for Europe our travel agent confirmed our reservation. However, when we arrived in Barcelona we were summarily informed that there had been a ""mistake,"" that they had given our room to another guest and that the hotel was full up. This is not the kind of mistake made by a first class hotel and we clearly were deliberately bumped in favor of a more attractive guest (like a regular or a wealthy oligarch or whatever). To be fair, they did book us into the nearby Ohla Hotel, which was excellent and hereby highly recommended. But avoid the Neri - they do not honor their commitments. Bad business.",1,2015,10,25
14,Very enjoyable visit,"Pleasant environment, accommodating staff and good food. Great location in the Gothic section of the city. Appreciated the extra services including mailing a package home and tips on sightseeing.  The room was spacious and enjoyed the balcony looking out on the square.",5,2015,10,25
14,Disappointing.,I arrived at the Hotel Neri with great expectations. The foyer was very dark and in need of an upgrade and the rooms as well. I was not well and was told I could not have lunch there as they were going to have a wedding in the dining room. My room is on the 1st floor overlooking a little square that is on the tour group track so I can't feel free to walk around the room not fully dressed. The window has no burglar bars so not safe to sleep with it open as even an average climber could get in. I asked to be moved. Was told the hotel was full and could go to the 2nd floor but room much smaller. This not acceptable. As I am not well was sleeping in the afternoon to be woken by the most unbelievable noise. The wedding is being held outside my bedroom window. I can not hear myself think I can only pray it will not go on into the evening. I booked this room four months ago through my travel agent and expected better treatment. The Neri is a Relais & Chateaux member and all I can say is that their standards must also have dropped. Can not recommend this hotel to the discerning traveler.,2,2015,10,24
14,Barcelona Trip,"Hotel was excellent, room was very comfortable, Hotel is situated in a great location and within walking distance from many main attractions. Hotel staff were very obliging & the food in the restaurant was excellent.",5,2015,10,22
14,Beautiful boutique property hidden away in the Gothic Quarter,"I took my partner here for his birthday and we had a fabulous long weekend! It is a bit tricky to find as it is hidden away in cute and charming side streets of the Gothic Quarter. We stayed in a Deluxe Room which was surprisingly large compaed to other 5star deluxe rooms especially in a city. The staff were very helpful, the breakfast is perfection and the bed is so comfortable. The location is perfect - 5 minutes from Placa Catalunya and Ramblas, 10 minutes to the harbour and right by the Cathedral. I have nothing to fault but make sure you know where it is before getting there - take a taxi from the airport or one of the hotels private transfers as they can explain where to go :)",5,2015,10,22
14,Location! Location! Location!,"This hotel is located in the most charming, historical section of the city. You cannot get a better place to start your vacation, your pre-cruise, your business trip. The hotel itself is an excellent example of a boutique hotel. It is small, full of charm, and has that small personal touch we all want. Nearby you will find shops selling vintage clothing, art and antiques.",5,2015,10,20
14,"Great service, great location, helpful concierge services","The breakfast is good, and worth including in your package. The concierge is most helpful in recommending restaurants, giving walking directions and arranging transportation. Many good restaurants within walking distance. Arrange airport transportation from hotel, as ordinary taxis do not take you to the hotel doorstep, which is on a very narrow street next to the Cathedral, (so that you do not have to transport your luggage through the streets).",5,2015,10,15
14,Barcelona at it's best!,"My wife and I travelled to Barcelona on the 14.09.15 and stayed for 5 nights in a deluxe room with a terrace!  We loved the location,decor,intimacy and the historic features of the property. Our room and facilities provided all our creature comforts and fulfilled all our expectations. Staff were professional and polite!  Breakfasts were good. Would have preferred more options to choose from on the a la carte menu for dinner! We particularly enjoyed visiting the Sagrada Famila and the Nativity Tower, La Pedrera (we booked the 9:pm slot to see the light and music show on the rooftop, which added to the museum experience), the trio of guitars, with flamenco performance at The Palau de la Musica and the Cathedral. We had an amazing trip and in between the sightseeing we just simply enjoyed strolling along the Barri Gotic region and relaxing on Barconaletta beach! Would stay at the Neri again should we choose to come back.",5,2015,10,09
14,amazing time in Barcelona,"this was not only a great hotel (the balcony was a wonderful plus) but the perfect jumping off point for the La Merce festival, which was the main reason we came to town.  It was easy to get to the squares we wanted to get to and the Metro was fairly easy.",5,2015,10,08
14,Fabulous experience!,"Wonderful room in historic building x 2! Terrific breakfast included.  Attentive staff, beautiful decor throughout.  Hotel booked a city tour for me with Ramon which was one of the top 10 days of my life!",5,2015,10,04
14,Expensive Haven,"Rooms amazing - in the gothic quarter so vies classic Barcelona back streets/squares.  Breakfast was laid back, lunches and evening meals a bit more formal with high quality interesting taster menus.  Hotel was very relaxed and relaxing.  Expensive but worth it to recover from the wonderful exhausting tours and festivals that make up the wonderful Barcelona.  The; staff very helpful on booking museums, directions, where to eat out of the hotel but a bit rubbish on parking advice.  If you HAVE to take your car - try to suss this out ( we never did!) and train or bus is probably better.",4,2015,10,04
14,"Magnificent location, luxury and charm trump views and weekday noise","My wife and I spent three nights at this hotel and would likely stay there again.  We wanted to be in the heart of the old town (part of the original Roman city) where it is an easy and magical walk to all sites.  The hotel itself has many high end touches and the breakfast, though pricey, was always satisfying.  You will be within steps of the  side entrance to the ancient Barcelona Cathedral and the underground excavations of the Roman city and the first Christian church built above it, not to speak of two excellent tapa bars (La Alcoba Azul and La Vinateria del Calle).  On the negative side, the rooms are smallish, most rooms are 15 to 20 feet away from another 700 hundred year building (now apartments) and from 8:00 to 5:30 on weekdays is a small private elementary school nearby.  You will definitely know when the children have recess.  All that said, the positives far outweigh the negatives if you enjoy being in an ancient place that is well preserved.",5,2015,10,04
14,Not high end,Far from a Relais and Chateaux.  Can't imagine how they became a member.  Lobby badly furnished.  No closet just shelves with a tiny curtain. External noise and view into apartments.  Food not very good.  Expected something more upscale.  Very difficult taxi access.,2,2015,10,03
14,Fabulous hotel,Thank you hotel Neri for all of your hospitality.  This hotel is intimate yet funky and cool at the same time.  The rooms are  extremely comfortable and the beds pillows  are fabulous.  The location couldn't be any better.  But most important is the attentiveness that the staff offered in helping to explore the great city of Barcelona.  Everyone there was beyond amazing but I need to especially thank Daniel  and Marta.  You both went beyond what a guest could expect and I graciously thank you for all the extrass. ,5,2015,10,02
14,Charming and elegant hotel with one of the most lovely and gracious staffs we've ever encountered in years of travel...,"The Neri was a fabulous place to spend  our ten days in Barcelona.  This is an architecturally stunning hotel in probably the most charming part of the city... casually elegant and impeccably run.  Besides an ambiance that is infused with rich history, character and style, my husband, son and I were struck by how wonderful everyone who works at this hotel is.  The staff -- Marta, Maria, David, Georgina, etc. -- is  truly charming, warm and gracious. Every single one of these lovely people went way out of their way to make sure we had the best kind of experience in Barcelona possible, and when an unexpected medical situation arose, they jumped in and went way beyond their professional obligations in making sure that expert medical care was arranged for and to express personal concern and caring. We will return, and, meanwhile, we are happily recommending it to anyone traveling to this amazing city.",5,2015,10,01
14,Tranquil hotel amidst bustling city,Perfect location to base sightseeing of Barcelona.  Very tranquil setting and atmosphere. We spent 2 nights here at the end of a cruise and loved every minute of it.  Staff was very helpful and we loved everything about the hotel.,5,2015,09,30
14,Sucha Special Place,Wonderful place to be in the old section of town. Hotel is so intimate and the staff are amazing. Always ready to assist and make your stay a bit better. Rooms were lovely and don't forget to sneak out on the patio upstairs on the roof.,5,2015,09,29
14,Wonderful Wedding venue,"We chose hotel Neri for our daughters wedding on 18th Sept, the staff were fantastic, there but not there if you see what we mean. The food was first class, the foie was the best ever, and the roof terrace perfect for the dancing. Well done and thank you to Claudia and her team. Our next goal is to stay for a few nights next year.",5,2015,09,28
14,Everything we expected and more,"Spent 6 days at the Hotel Neri and we would highly recommend it.  The location is perfect, central to everything.  The rooms, while small, are luxurious, and my husband wants to take the shower home with us.  Breakfast was delicious, the staff was amazingly helpful.  Cava at the rooftop bar under the stars was magical.  We would definitely recommend this place and hope to return!",5,2015,09,28
14,Fantastic - Well Above Our Expectations,"This hotel is not just gorgeous (well thought out modern architecture within layers of history), the service is also excellent. 

The staff were very friendly, helpful and accommodating, which was very welcome given we were travelling with a 2.5yr old! 
Our room was comfortable and clean, with complimentary wifi.

The breakfast was relatively simple, but great quality and reasonable selection- just don't expect a giant US style buffet feast.

We would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a quality, boutique hotel experience in the heart of Barcelona's historic Gothic Quarter- couldn't be more convenient.

If you're travelling with an infant, just be sure to call ahead and ask for them to provide you with a cot - the cot in our room was great- they even included an activity pack with a set of colouring pencils, and also kid size towel & toiletries.

If one was to be extremely fussy and picky, the only negatives might be that the passenger lift is slow (seems to be common in Barcelona), the roof terrace is a bit of a non-event (small, no real views), and that your room's windows will likely be overlooked by the neighbours, who are just across the narrow lanes - something that you can't avoid in a place like the gothic quarter, and should really be seen as part of the location's charm - Besides, one can simply draw the curtains and you have all the privacy you need!

What you really need to know is that we would not hesitate to go there again - hopefully for a longer stay!",5,2015,09,28
14,THIS IS A HARD ONE!,"Having booked 3 nights at the Neri and having read all the wonderful reviews we were really looking forward to our stay. Our party of 4 were greeted in the small front lobby upon check in and informed that our rooms were not ready and offered a free wine/beer outside in their rear terrace , that someone would be back to let us know when our rooms are available! After about an hour wait and finishing our wine/beer without hearing from anyone we decided to have lunch.Two hours later without anyone telling us our rooms were ready we went back to front desk to find out our rooms were ready. 
Our room was small but very well appointed with a nice stone shower. The first night at approximately 10:00 pm the toilet keep running and would not flush. I tried to call the front desk but could not operate the phone, so I got dressed and walked down the steeps to the front desk, but the front desk girl was in a conversation with another guest, I waited several minutes then finally had to interrupt their conversation to inform about the toilet problem, she said she would have someone check it. Several minutes later the front desk girl showed up at the room to try and fix the toilet, she got it to stop running and we went to bed. Next morning my wife went to use toilet and it would not flush. Learning the phone system I called the front desk to inform about the problem, and in the mean time by taking the top off the toilet and pushing with my finger I at least got it to flush. Later the plumber showed up and fixed the toilet.
The second day of our stay the toilet would not work again, and being very Irish my temper started to boil, paying 355 euros a night without the use of a toilet 2 out of 3 days.

To the hotels credit on the second day they offered to move us to another room, but we had already unpacked and figuring they could fix the problem we stayed in the room #208. Our last evening we had a wonderful dinner at the hotel with our traveling friends and the hotel manager did comp our meal and drinks , plus gave us a bottle of wine in our room.

Other than the toilet problem, this is a wonderful hotel in the Gothic section (within the old Roman Walls) of the city.  Larger taxi's can not drive to the front entry and must park about a 100 yards from hotel, making you drag your luggage thru the narrow cobblestone streets. 

It appeared to me that the hotel at certain times was understaffed!",4,2015,09,24
14,Another Great Stay at the Hotel Neri,"My husband and I and four friends stayed at the Neri this past week.  We have been there twice before and are very pleased to report that it is still a super hotel and we look forward to going back again in the future. The hotel is a boutique property in the best sense of the word - not super trendy but beautifully thought out and maintained.   The rooms are modern but not cold, the housekeeping service is top notch (rooms are incredibly clean) and the service overall is excellent.  There is a lovely breakfast.  And to make it all the more exciting it is a very good value.  Wonderful!",5,2015,09,23
14,A tranquil gem in the heart of the Barri Gotic,"We absolutely loved Hotel Neri during our recent stay.  My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary with a 5-night stay in Barcelona, and we selected Hotel Neri based on the many positive reviews on TripAdvisor.  Our stay was everything we hoped for and more!  The location in Barri Gotic was perfect - very central to everything we wanted to see in that area, and yet quiet and peaceful.  The boutique hotel has the charm of an old building with the amenities of a fully refurbished and updated building.  Our room was a beautiful corner room with stylish décor and plenty of light.

Every morning we enjoyed the breakfast, which was included in our room rate.  We sat in the quiet dining room and enjoyed a made-to-order omelet, pastries, fresh fruit, cheeses, lattes, etc.   Every evening we took advantage of the roof-top bar, a lovely and romantic setting on a warm summer night.

The staff was incredibly professional and attentive.  One morning, I mentioned to a woman at the front desk that the dry air from the air conditioning was causing me some trouble, and she had a humidifier set up in our room before we returned that evening (which made all the difference).

My only suggestion for Hotel Neri is that it would be helpful to have more staff working at the rooftop bar at night, as it seems to be a popular place to hang out and the server had to go to the first floor to pick up all food and drink orders.

Our stay was perfect in every way.  We cannot wait to go back!",5,2015,09,22
14,Fabulous time at the Hotel Neri in Barcelona!,"We loved the hotel.  The staff was very accommodating in assisting us with transportation, tours, dinner reservations and airline check-in.  The location was superb...very close to restaurants, La Rambla Plaza Cataluyna, the Port,  Museums, the Cathedral and bus tours. We booked the Neri Suite.  The room was very spacious and comfortable.  The rain shower was exhilarating!  Thank you for making my 49th Birthday trip with my mom very special!",5,2015,09,21
14,Boutique Hotel right in the Gothic Quarter,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel Neri Relais & Chateaux and we were not disappointed.  The situation of the hotel is ideal for exploring both the Gothic Quarter, the Born District / La Ribera area as well as most other neighbouring districts.  The hotel itself is lovely, atmospheric and very nicely appointed.  Our deluxe room with terrace was quiet, very comfortable and large with a very large terrace.  The staff were  very friendly, helpful and approachable and were happy to help with any and all questions that we had.  We would definitely stay again and, hopefully, we'll have another opportunity to.  Thank you Hotel Neri for a lovely stay!",5,2015,09,15
14,well located in the gothic district,"Hotel Neri
Is situated in Barcelona's gothic district a few minutes walk from La Ramblas, the Cathedral, and a 20 minute stroll from the beach and port area of Barcelonetta. The hotel backs on to the famous St Felipe square where Franco's troops massacred 48 citizens, mostly children, in 1938. The school which housed most of the infants is still located in the square.
The hotel is 5 star with stylish contemporary decor and an impressive stone and glass atrium in its centre.
However, we found the 5 star rating a little excessive. The rooms are well appointed although somewhat drab. The restaurant is small and disjointed and the bar area lacking in atmosphere.
We stayed as a family for two nights prior to New Year and the staff were welcoming although I would say this hotel is mostly used by affluent older couples on romantic city breaks.
Our two night stay for a family of five, in two rooms, cost €1,800, including breakfast and a taxi transfer from the airport to the hotel.
Pricey, but Neri is well located in Barcelona's most atmospheric district, with plenty of authentic tapas bars,restaurants, boutique shops and galleries within a short walk of the hotel.",4,2015,09,15
14,Amazing boutique hotel in great location,"My wife, 6 yr. old son and I recently stayed at the Neri for two nights. The staff was gracious throughout or stay and the hotel has a very inviting and relaxing feel. The room was wonderfully designed with a nice view of the plaza. The food was delicious and we really enjoyed the rooftop bar. They made our young son happy with a welcome gift and even had cookies for him at check in.The hotel is well located for touring Barcelona and we highly recomend it!",5,2015,09,14
14,Very nice neighbourhood in walking distance of all major sights,"Standard was not very big but bed was very good. The only thing we did not really find fitting was the curtain in front of the closet. Restaurant and bar were very nice.
The reception desk was very helpful when we seeked for help to retrieve vouchers for tours we booked.",4,2015,09,14
14,Luxury in Gothic Barcelona,"The hotel is located in the center of the Gothic quarter of Barcelona. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. The included breakfast buffet could feed an army, with excellent service. The concierges were outstanding, fluent in multiple languages, and attended to your every need.",5,2015,09,13
14,Amazing ,"Besides falling in love with everything about this hotel .. The position was tops!

Great location in the Gothic Quater 
Decor was simply amazing 
I cannot fault this place, we stayed here for three funfilled nights and I would go back any day ! The staff were great - a very stylish boutique hotel - the restaurant was amazing as well as the breakfast which looked out into the quaint streets.. See pics ",5,2015,09,09
14,An excellent stay in Barcelona at the Hotel Neri,"Accommodations were perfect, extremely comfortable, and clean. The consierge always had excellent suggestions for food and activities. The central location made it very easy to get anywhere we needed to be quickly either by foot or train. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our time at the Hotel Neri.",5,2015,09,09
14,Once again at Neri,"This august me and my boyfriend went for the third time to Barcelona, and it was our secound stay at Neri (the first time was in 2013, and by that time, the hotel had 4 stars), so you know what this review will reveal. 
Neri is a very pleasent hotel in the Gothic Quarter. It's location allow us to move around downton without many fisical effort. The decoration is mininamlist, classy and exquisite. The staff has extra care with cleaning and tidding up the room. The amentaties are proper to the hotel and the city, althow it's always good a cup of tea at night, dispite the hot weather.
The reception staff were always up to the task, being friendly and joyfull (thumbs up for Jacopo!).
The deluxe room with terraza is an excellant room. In the terraza you can find a matress on the floor and some pillows to enjoy the warm nights. 
The only thing to point a finger is the noise of the machins cleaning the streets early morning, but it's a good way to get up of bed early to visit Barcelona avoiding the heat.",5,2015,09,08
14,Delightful Barcelona surprise.,"Discovering Hotel Neri's location -- tucked away on mysterious alley in Barcelona's Gothic district -- is fun in itself, though merely a teaser to the Hotel's excellence. Quite convenient to the Picasso museum and other Barcelona ""must sees"", the hotel will happily arrange transportation to venues not within walking distance. A former residence transformed to an intimate and charming hotel, Neri provides travelers every loveliness missing from busy lives: attentive staff (especially Alex, the evening concierge), comfortable rooms, surprising amenities, wonderful food, a complete knowledge of Barcelona and all its brilliance.",5,2015,09,08
14,Superb hotel with a great location and very helpful staff,"Make sure you find time to sit in the little square at the back of the hotel - San Felip Neri.
Also visit the rooftop bar for cocktails and a lovely view.
This is a wonderful hotel, with a great location right in the Gothic quarter. The staff could not be more helpful and went out of their way to make us feel welcome.",5,2015,09,07
14,More than we could ask for!,"Very recently stayed at Neri Barcelona. Fantastic experience from start to finish. Easy communication from home to reserve room, set up transportation from airport (not easy to drive to in narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter. Picked up with Mercedes and a very helpful driver. Check in to a wonderful glass of Spanish white wine. Taken to our virtually perfect room per our request (quiet/spacious) room 305 on third floor with wrap around terrace - outdoor chairs, relaxing bed and hammock! Room very nicely appointed. Lovely full breakfast (part of our package). Service was 5 star! Anything we needed was attended to with great attitude and apparent pleasure. Great location very close to Cathedral - easy to walk to so many wonderful sites.Nice outdoor area to have drinks or food in historic square. This is exactly the type and quality of small boutique luxury hotels we look for. Would have liked option of breakfast outdoor in back area - only suggestion. Would stay again for sure, will recommend to others actively.",5,2015,09,06
14,Gorgeous Barcelona Haven,What a lovely place to stay. The staff was bend-over-backwards welcoming to us. The room was wonderfully comfortable. Love the shower. The food in the restaurant was delicious.  This was a five star experience in every way. Can't wait to come back!,5,2015,08,31
14,WOW,"This is a great property: great staff, great food, great location. It was an expensive hotel but we loved it. The bathrooms were large, lots of luggage storage and the breakfast is not to be missed. If you have dietary needs let them know ahead of time and they will do a great job meeting them.",5,2015,08,30
14,Hotel was worth the splurge!,"I was really impressed with this hotel - everything from the location to the staff to the showers (rainfall with another great nozzle and the best water pressure!).  Beds very comfortable - the bed is similar to many European hotels (2 singles joined together to make a large bed).

I loved the location as it was easily walkable to El Born in the evenings and right in the middle of Barri Gotic.

2 things to note - First, no pool, so although the rooftop terrace was very nice, the no pool factor is a negative if you are going in the summer and that is important for you.  Second, it is kind of hard to find and on a really narrow street in the old quarter.  I didn't have a great map before I arrived, and my cab driver just dropped me in a Plaza nearby and pointed.  I was actually only 2 short blocks away (once I found it, it was easy from then on), but my cab driver's pointing to the wrong street left me wandering for about 20 minutes with my luggage.  I would either hire a car service or print out a detailed map of the location if this is your first stay as to easily find it!",5,2015,08,26
14,Light filled atrium but dark rooms,"Well, the location unless your arriving early or very late is an  extremely  busy walking area , so get dropped of close by.... the room we booked of the net was rather dark and small as we were only staying for a night i couldn't be bothered complaining or paying for an upgrade ...., the food from the kitchen was of extremely high quality so recommend dining here , boutique feel , good staff...they have a roof top bar which is fun but no pool where as the Mercer and the Serras have small pools with their roof top bars if your staying in the height of summer  or have little ones could be considered. Beds ok comfort factor , though joined in the middle ( 2 x singles with a joiner) hmmm",4,2015,08,25
14,Almost perfect,"This property is fabulous. The location albeit a heavy traveled corridor, is awesome. The interior design is spectacular and the rooms are extremely comfortable with all the  comforts you would need.
A few things to note though. I would have said this place is perfect but aside from one lovely girl named Marta at the front desk, the staff is severly lacking in any local knowledge and experience. They are young hip kids but i expected a little more from a relais and chateau property as far as top notch staff. I am speaking specifically about the front desk here...twice our restaurant reservations were made at the wrong times but worse, when we were given directions to specific restaurants no one warned us that we were walking throught some tough...really tough neighborhoods at late hours. I am a new yorker and trust me i know tough neighborhoods, but this was a bit jarring. A little heads-up would have been helpful. Dont get me wrong they were lovely, but not very savvy about the area in which they should know inside out. Back to the good stuff now.  The maid service and cleaning staff were absolutely some of the best i have ever seen. Truly top notch. So, all in all this place is wonderful but i suggest you research restaurants and safe areas to walk at night before you arrive.",5,2015,08,22
14,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location","The hotel is literally next to the Gothic Cathedral. You could not ask for a hotel in a better location for seeing the old town part of of Barcelona. The staff were wonderful - especially after the website (independent of the hotel) that we had booked through made a mess of our booking. Out room wasn't ready when we arrived, and the staff made a huge effort to make us as comfortable as possible,",5,2015,08,19
14,Wonderful contemporary feel in the heart of Barcelona's ancient Gothic Quarter,"We stayed several days, to see Barcelona for the first time at a relaxed pace - together far from kids for the first time. Hotel Neri was great - centrally located, luxurious, and the staff was very patient with our many questions. The quiet rooftop bar is a wonderful space. The blackout curtains helped to adjust to jet lag. If you want to get work done, in one room the desk was excellent, but in the other it was cramped - plus wifi was not too fast.",5,2015,08,17
14,"great find, terrific staff","Could not have asked for anything more.   Room was very classy and decent size for European standards.  Staff was very helpful at all times, couldn't do enough for us.  Rooftop bar was a nice surprise.   A map emailed beforehand might have been helpful as it seems like taxis don't like to go right up to the hotel.",5,2015,08,16
14,Brilliant food,"We were in another hotel just out of town, but had lunch at Neri. I can only say: do yourself a favour and order a meal here. It was brilliant: quality ingredients, simple but sophisticated, beautiful presentation (my wife forced me to take a picture and for once I just had to oblige), light and healthy, and above all packed with flavour. Excellent.",5,2015,08,15
14,Still my favourite hotel,"This was our fifth stay over the last 10 years and while some hotels become dated and tired, Neri has found a formula and stuck to it. Wonderful staff, an intimate setting and beautiful rooms. The smell on entry from the myriad of scented candles is a joy, no matter how stressed you feel on arrival you leave relaxed. All rooms are spacious and well appointed, the restaurant is also outstanding. The location is magnificent for gentle strolls. We shall be returning.",5,2015,08,11
14,Stunning and Intimate,"A truly stunning boutique hotel that provides you with a luxurious but intimate and personal service. The location is fantastic and enables you to get straight into the heart of Barcelona, to experience they best of the city's oldest culture and architecture. A great pleasure was having breakfast every morning in the peaceful Saint Philip Neri Placa, which itself is steeped in history. The service at the hotel was friendly and discreet, with staff very happy to help with any queries and to offer recommendations for restaurants and bars etc. The hotel very kindly upgraded us to a suite and the room was perfect. We loved the mix of the contemporary furnishings and overall minimalist look against the backdrop of the antique building. The bed was huge and one of the comfiest we have slept in. Last year we stayed at Soho House Hotel in New York and for us, Hotel Neri has a very similar vibe, which makes you feel instantly relaxed. The hotel smells divine too! I could go on...but if you have the opportunity to stay here, then you really really must!",5,2015,08,07
14,Hotel Neri ,"My husband and I have stayed in some wonderful hotels but we are both in agreement this was by far the best. 

As our first holiday abroad as a family of three, (our son is nearly 5) we were debating where to travel. My husband and I have been to Barcelona many times so after looking all across Europe, we realised in the end it was the perfect choice. It has everything you need for a family, sun, a great zoo, parks, wine, siesta's! 
(We also promised ourselves that on our next Barcelona visit we would stay at The Neri.)

Not only are the flights excellent in the length of travel time, but using the sentinel car park and shuttle service our ease of arriving at Leeds/Bradford airport was one of relaxation and excitement.

Landing into a very hot Barcelona morning, we were greeted by our lovely driver who ushered us into our waiting air conditioned car. 
On arriving at Hotel Neri, it certainly didn't disappoint. The building is beautiful, while the interior decor is atmospheric and stylish. 
We were immediately offered refreshments, which we took in the library while our room was being prepared. In this time the wonderful General Manager came to talk to our son, she even gave him a gift of a polar bear soft toy. 
A lovely introduction to not only him but us to. 

We booked the junior suite which was a great size, very well maintained and luxurious. Our view was of the courtyard where we were serenaded every evening over a glass of wine by a varied array of musicians. The acoustics were very good so I think it's a favourite spot for any singer with a guitar. We didn't have to worry as soon as we closed the windows it was brilliantly soundproofed.
Even with having another bed for my son the room had ample living space. 
When we first entered our room we found a personalised note to our son on his bed with a colouring book. 
It's the little things that make a 5* hotel! 

The most amazing thing we feel about the Neri was the staff. You can have the most beautiful building in the world but without the team foundation you have nothing. From the General Manager, the Reception team, to the Manager of the Bar and Restaurant who my son thought was amazing. To Mary, the wonderful chambermaid that always had a genuinely lovely smile on her face and cleaned our suite to perfection.

Other things of excellence the menu! The food was delicious from room service breakfast to modern tapas in the courtyard. The kitchen on request also made my son simpler dishes. Again it's all in the service!

It's amazing that in Barcelona and other European cities children are truly embraced.
After writing this review I wish we were back in the Neri having a glass or two! 

",5,2015,07,29
14,Sleeping next to the pope,"the hotel is situated in old town and is next door to the Pope's palace. It's a neat thought to think you're sleeping next door to the Pope.  Beyond that, the hotel is very nice, well designed, boutique in style, with gorgeous lighting, and the most helpful staff.  We loved walking out the doors right in the heart of old town.  After traveling three weeks on our honeymoon, this was our end stay,  Beautiful find!",5,2015,07,27
14,Beautiful hotel,"Great location, wonderful staff who were very helpful. Rooms are beautiful, very quiet, bed so comfortable. A perfect place to stay in barcelona.the bar on the roof top is a lovely place for an evening drink. We walked to all the main sights easily from here. ",5,2015,07,19
14,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed at the Hotel Neri for my husband's birthday and I have to say this is one of the most beautiful and unusual hotels we have ever stayed in. The interior is breathtaking. We had a junior suite which was spacious, with an amazing bathroom and overlooked the little square at the back.

The breakfast in the library was fantastic, fresh fruit, lovely bread with meat and cheese and croissants, followed by choice of omelette.

The hotel is in a fantastic location, situated in the beautiful Gothic area and close to La Rambla. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to return again in the future",5,2015,07,14
14,Awesome stay at the Hotel Neri,Great location in the Old City. Very quiet since cars do not travel on the narrow streets. The staff is fantastic. The rooms are well appointed and good size. I'm a hotel executive with a major chain. I was very impressed and highly recommend the hotel.,5,2015,07,13
14,"Fabulous, Charming Gothic District Hotel","From the moment you walk in and smell the scent of the lobby, you know you picked the right hotel! The decor is simple, beautiful and modern. The room was very well appointed and quite large by European standards. The breakfast was more than perfect and served by the friendly restaurant staff. The front desk gave us a tour of the property and guided us to our room, they also helped arrange reservations for dinner and tours. The bathroom was fabulous made of stone with interesting lighting and the bed was heavenly! The location of the property was walkable to many things, but still far enough from Ramblas to remain charming and quaint. Your search stops here....book this hotel.",5,2015,07,09
14,Wedding,My Daughter was married at Santa Maria Del Mar. Her reception was held at Hotel Neri.they stayed there 3 nights and loved it. The reception was amazing first tapas in the courtyard with champagne and wine.service was excellent and the food was delicious.  Then up to the rooftop garden for more food and drink. Dancing all night. The staff was very accommodating and the night was just perfect. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be treated like royalty!,5,2015,07,07
14,What a gem!,"Barcelona was falling in the middle of our three week European trip so we decided that we would splurge and book a Relais & Chateaux.  We were so glad that we did.  The location to begin with is terrific, right in the middle of the Gothic quarter.  It is close to many attractions and so many great spots to eat.  The building itself is lovely.  As soon as you walk in you know that you will have ample opportunity to rest and relax from your day.  We book a suite that over looked the court yard.  Our room was beautiful.  Plenty of room.  The bathroom was great with a fabulous bathtub where I spent much time in the evenings.  As you can imagine, the bed was a fairy tale.  I happened to not feel well our first night that we arrived and really needed a quality night sleep.  After a warm bath, some complimentary hot tea, I slept very well.  The service was very much up to par with what you would expect at a Relais & Chateaux.  Always available to answer questions or meet any need you might have.  We also enjoyed the terrace on the roof in the evening.  We would have cocktail and talk about the day.  Our 7 year old daughter also thought the hotel was extra special.  They had waiting for guests chocolate chip cookies in the lobby every day.  She loved the fact that she had her very own robe, slippers, and bath accessories.  We recommend this hotel with great confidence that you will be equally pleased.  We also look forward to another visit to the city and to Hotel Neri.",5,2015,07,07
14,Fabulous Barcelona,"From the moment we arrived via private transfer (although expensive) we were given exceptional service and even a complimentary upgrade. We stayed in the Junior Suite that overlooked the courtyard and fountain and was lovely and peaceful. The staff at the hotel go out of their way to make your stay very welcoming and comfortable and we had no problems whatsoever. It's a stunning hotel, very clean, fabulous rooms, food, wine, nothing was too much trouble. We would highly recommend staying at Hotel Neri which is in the heart of the Gothic quarter and within walking distance of most sites even if you do get lost amongst the many labrinths of streets it just adds to the atmosphere and the architecture of the surrounding buildings is stunning. We had no trouble with thieves or pick pockets in and around the area of La Ramblas although it does get very busy so keep your wits about you, we felt perfectly safe. We will return soon we hope to finish off seeing the many sites still left on our list.",5,2015,07,07
14,Perfect location in Barcelona ,"Charming hotel in the heart of the old city. Rooms were a bit small, but had plenty of drawers for your belongings. Breakfast was included but the service was not great. They seemed understaffed. Great cheese platter with croissants along with your choice of eggs. In the middle of the city near everything. ",4,2015,07,03
14,Great location-high end hotel,Right in the middle of Gothic Quarter. Rooms very comfortably appointed with all the amenities you would expect. Only 23 rooms. We had a standard room and were satisfed. Walked everywhere very easily. Quaint hotel with good breakfast and friendly helpful staff.,5,2015,06,30
14,Fantastic location in a charming hotel,"Great hotel, best location and the staff very helpful. Situated in the middle of the gothic quarter. Easy access to good restaurants &cafes. Room very clean, serviced daily. Situated in a charming street",4,2015,06,30
14,Perfect hotel in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter,Hôtel Neri is a quiet gem hidden away on one of Barcelona's most picturesque squares next to the Cathedral and near Las Ramblas. The staff was wonderful especially Marta and the concierge team. The room was a stylish oasis with a comfortable bed and beautiful stonework in the bathroom. We'll happily return on our next visit.,5,2015,06,29
14,A hidden gem,"What a gem of a hotel right in the middle of the Jewish quarter literally a stone's throw from Barcelona Cathedral. The hotel has been sympathetically restored and has a modern yet comfortable interior throughout.  The minute you step in through the door you're transported to a calm oasis.  The staff are exceptional, friendly, attentive and very knowledgable and somehow manage to add to the serenity of the building.  We had a deluxe room on the fourth floor with a sizeable balcony complete with table, chairs, day bed and hammock.  The room itself included the expected amenities and the bathroom was large with full amenities provided.  We only ate breakfast on one morning but it's one of the best we've experienced in a hotel, do try the pancakes.  We also ate in the restaurant on our second night and again it was very high quality, beautifully presented with a large choice and some unique offerings.  The roof terrace is very pretty and although does not afford views over Barcelona it's certainly a little oasis with flowers and lighting and has comfortable and bar stool seating.  Being based here was ideal as you can meander through the narrow streets and get lost browsing in shops, eating ice-cream and dining at the numerous tapas bars and restaurants as well as being able to explore a number of the cities places of interest such as the Cathedral and Placa del Rei and you're in walking distance of Las Ramblas, yet it does not feel touristy at all.  The hotel even provides a street map with places of interest, recommended eateries and shops.  We arranged an airport pick up as had been told taxi's often will not drive through the Jewish quarter and it was well worth it as we were able to pull up literally around the corner from the hotel and the driver wheeled our suitcases the 200 meters to the hotel and did the same in reverse when we departed.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,29
14,Great service at a great location,"This hotel is in the heart of the Gothic quarter, very close to the Cathedral and easy walking distance to all the central places of interest, as well as the metro system at Liceu of Jaume stations. A downside for some may be that the airport taxis seem reluctant, if not incapable of negotiating the tiny streets to the hotel's front door. The city black and yellow cabs DO come to the door, at least when booked from the hotel, but those who object to perhaps having to roll a suitcase for maybe 200 metres might complain. We found this a price well worth paying for the charm of the situation, and this distance is less than that one has to drag luggage at most airports anyway. The hotel is quiet, and the bar and restaurant opens out onto one of Barcelona's most atmospheric squares - small, shaded, and with a beautiful fountain. The room we occupied for 5 days was big enough and, with the bathroom, was fully equipped with up-to-the-minute furniture, facilities and appliances. The twin beds were the most comfortable we have slept in anywhere - even at home, as well as in hotels around the world. A small jewel in the crown is the roof terrace, where a cool drink on a summer's evening, listening to the gentle babble of voices and the fountain in the square below, while relaxing in a hammock or on comfortably-cushioned seating was a delightful experience. The staff were, without exception, friendly, highly competent, but not obsequious, very accommodating of our ignorance of Catalan and incompetence in Spanish, and ready to sort out anything we wished, whether it was taxis, bookings for museums and tourist sites, or minor queries in the hotel itself. Naturally, this kind of service, in this kind of locations, in one of the world's most delightful cities does not come cheap, but the price reflects value for money. We would find it hard to stay anywhere else in Barcelona in future.",5,2015,06,28
14,Wonderful Hotel,"stayed here in June 2015 for 5 nights. The reception staff provided a first class service helping me book outside activities. The lady who is in charge of all the restaurants and bars, was extremely helpful in resolving an issue that we had with lack of service at the roof top bar from the only member of staff in the hotel who wasn't concerned with customer service. The location of the hotel is in the most beautiful area of Barcelona. This was our second visit to this hotel and we will return to this hotel each time we visit Barcelona.",5,2015,06,27
14,"Location, location, location","We spotted this hotel on a previous visit to Barcelona and were looking forward to staying in the heart of the city. Relais & Chateaux is one of the pre-eminent 'badges' of quality and in terms of style, ambience and attention to detail the Neri scores very well. The concierge staff were very helpful and in particular in terms of arranging a guided tour of the city. Less impressive (in our experience) was the dining room. At lunch (on our arrival) we were told that a sparsely occupied restaurant was 'fully booked' and not offered any alternative. Breakfast was vaguely comic, with a member of staff pointing out the coffee machine, bowl of fruit, muffins etc. Whilst not at the height of my powers I suspect I might have made it that far unaided.... All in all though, very good and so it should be.",4,2015,06,23
14,nice hotel,stayed here for 1 week and started the week in standard room for 2 days and then moved into room on 3rd floor for rest of holiday both rooms nice staff will fall over backwards for you . BIG PLUS IS THE RESTAURANT top notch food and service . Only downside  was noisy kids from 8am which could be heard from all three floors otherwise a  haven in the busy barri gotic area,4,2015,06,20
14,"Ticked all the ""right"" boxes","Hotel Neri ticked all our boxes. Great location, great service, lovely room (large bed) with a beautiful rooftop bar. We arrived on my husbands birthday and they surprised him with a cake in our room - this level of care was shown for the 3 nights we stayed.",5,2015,06,19
14,Big Surprise! A true gem!,"Rick Steves was wrong using the word ""pretentious""; that implies you are pretending to be something you're not.  Neri achieves its ambition as an upscale micro-hotel with the ambiance and service one would expect but seldom get. Neri is itself an historical experience, and the staff had just the right mix of friendliness and professional acumen.  The hotel interior is an artist jewel, blending roman ruins with exceptional modern art.  Our room was small but loaded with well-designed comforts and overlooks an historical court yard that serves as a playground for school kids during the day and strolling lovers at night (featured in Steves' travel video on Catalunya).

While its prices seem high, they are not nearly as high as supposed luxury hotels that we have stayed at in the city outskirts, a half-hour from the old town.  The location is surprisingly good -- central, yet quiet, secure neighborhood throughout the day and night.  We will definitely stay here longer next time.",5,2015,06,18
14,"Nice hotel, Excellent Location","Hotel Neri is a small hotel located in the Gothic Quarter and its room prices reflect its location. However, in the main the rooms and service also live up to the price. Reception staff are friendly, warm and helpful as was the excellent barman who was on duty in the roof top bar during our stay.

A couple of minor improvements would have made this a firm five, rather than ""is it 4 or 5"" debate. The restaurant food is not bad and sitting on the square in the evening is wonderful - be sure to book - but the restaurant staff were rather dour and not so on the ball - 2 attempts to get a wine list, wrong starter (which I didn't change as it was nice!) and this was early in the evening when they were still quiet. Breakfast is a bit of an unusual affair andnerally good but please, please stop relying on Nesso and Krupps machines for the coffee - which we hate! Just a good pot of filter coffee would be such a nice alternative.",5,2015,06,16
14,"""Great Location & Staff""",My wife and I enjoyed 5 great nights at Hotel Neri after our travels from San Sebastián & LaGaurdia.  We did a lot of research on hotels and reviews and could not have been more pleased with our decision of Hotel Neri.,4,2015,06,14
14,Peaceful haven in a busy city,"Hotel Neri is hidden away in the old narrow streets behind the cathedral , very convenient for the shops and about 10 minutes from the metro.Nothing was too much trouble for the delightful,friendly staff who had to deal with a pair of technologically challenged pensioners! Our room was very comfortable and was spotlessly clean.The food served in the restaurant was exquisitely tasty and innovative.Breakfast was fresh with a traditional Spanish twist.Hot options were available.We would readily return to this hotel .",5,2015,06,12
14,"Spectacular hotel, spectacular location...","We spent three beautiful days at the Neri and enjoyed every minute.  The rooms are modern and clean, the breakfasts wonderful, the ambiance perfect, and the staff  over the top.  We had adjacent rooms while staying with kids at the back of the property overlooking the shady Neri square with its church, a fountain, a gargoyle or two, and historic walls pockmarked from the tragic Spanish Civil War.  The Gothic quarter location is spectacular, just steps away from the old cathedral.  A gem of a hotel in a magnificent city.",5,2015,06,12
14,Nobody does it better!,"A true gem! From the beginning to the end of our stay, we had experienced such personal service. Tucked away in front of Sant Felip Neri (Gaudi was headed for his daily prayers when he was stuck by a tram)...you can walk to many of the attractions such a Picasso Museum, Las Ramblas, the Cathedral, etc.  The restaurant is superb and a served breakfast in the library is included. In the evening the small park in the churchyard behind the hotel is a place for lovers!!!!! This is definitely the place to stay for service and the old world charm of Catalonia.",5,2015,06,09
14,"Beautiful, chic, relaxing, and helpful staff","We thoroughly loved the Hotel Neri.  It is located in an obscure spot on a tiny side street tucked behind the cathedral so be warned that locating it and parking for it are not easy tasks.  But, it was most definitely worth it.  The staff were super friendly and helpful to come out to find us driving around when we couldn't find the (underground) parking garage and escorted us back to the hotel.  They also helped us secure restaurant reservations last minute.
The hotel is beautiful and the so was the modern decor.  The king size bed was comfortable and we had plenty of room to spread out our things - which surprised me!  The bathroom was modern and new, and the shower is made of stone with a waterfall shower head.  It felt like I was at a spa each time.  
We utilized the rooftop terrace one evening for a glass of wine as the sun was beginning to go down.  There was a nice breeze, the aroma of honeysuckle bushes, and lounge type music playing.  It's worth popping up there for a drink or to hang out a bit longer.
We also ate the hotel breakfast both mornings in the library and it was definitely plenty of food.  They serve the traditional breakfast platter with meats, cheeses, and fruits.  They have pastries, juices, and whole fruits sitting out to take.  And you can also order warm breakfast (eggs, pancakes) as well.
We both agreed we'd go back to the Hotel Neri.",5,2015,06,02
14,Delightful stay,"My wife and I had a great experience staying not only once but twice sandwiched around an excursion to the northwest of Spain. The hotel met our every need including storage of our luggage, making restaurant reservations and connections with events and local merchants. The bathrooms are very tastefully done with large showers and vanities, the bedding and décor was comfortable. They have an on-site restaurant which is open virtually all day as well as a roof top garden, which after a day of seeing a lot of hard surfaces, its greenery is a welcome respite. I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants and needs very close proximity to the historic quarter and its shopping, cathedral, restaurants and other historic sites.",5,2015,06,02
14,Upscale chic hotel,"Hidden gem in the gothic quarter. Decor very chic and reception upon arrival welcoming.My junior suite was wonderful as well as the staff, service, rooftop bar and food . Rate it  4 1/2 stars - would have given it 5, but hotel did not have a gym. Highly recommend to couples, gal trip, mother-daughter, etc.",5,2015,06,02
14,A jewel!,"Great location in the Gothic quarter.  The junior suite 106  is wonderful - large, beautifully decorated and no noise.  However, what impressed me most was their staff friendliness and professionalism.  Front desk Jacopo, Juan Daniel and Martha were always knowledgeable and great with the group I was with - always ready to make our staying pleasant. Cannot forget to mention Juan, at the restaurant - great dinner experience. We had a lovely week experience.  I highly recommend the Neri!",5,2015,06,01
14,Good quality boutique hotel,"Great service, pleasant and very helpful  concierge people, good central location. Make sure to ask for a room that does not face the church/school courtyard, which can be quite noisy in the morning and late at night.",4,2015,05,29
14,Fawlty Towers,"The staff here are very friendly but have trouble in getting things right. My travel agent had organised the hotel to pick me up at the airport after a 25 hour trip from Australia.  They Forgot.  My husband booked a wake up call for 2 am so that he could chair a meeting over the phone, they missed the time and came pounding on the door an hour late.  The restaurant was very nice but slow and expensive. Our friends travelling with us got a more superior room at a much lesser price.  The situation in the old city is excellent for site seeing.  Be prepared to carry your bags as taxis drop you 400m away.",3,2015,05,29
14,"fantastic location, better service","We could not have picked a more perfect place to stay! We found great little restaurants and bars at our doorstep.  We walked every where unless we rented electric bikes…  Breakfast was lovely, service was impeccable.  The room was gorgeous and spacious!
Dinner recommendations were fantastic as well!",5,2015,05,28
14,Zen Experience Exemplified,"We arrived at Hotel Neri and as most Americans do look for the check in desk.  A hotel employee welcomed us and asked us if we wanted something to drink and offered us a chair where we were checked in.  This would be the beginning of the MOST enjoyable hotel stay I have had to date in my world wide travels.  Breakfast is an absolute MUST!  No menus, just tell them what u want.",5,2015,05,26
14,Loved it - great place,"A deluxe room on the third floor.  Balcony a little compromised by the proximity of adjoining apartment building but to be expected in that location.  The room was great with a really comfortable bed and plenty of space.  A fantastic location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.  A hiccup with breakfast in our room one morning but more than made up for by the hotel, when mentioned.  Overall a wonderful experience and we'll be heading back in the future.",4,2015,05,26
14,Fantastic experience in a perfect location,"Had the good fortune to stay at Hotel Neri, on the recommendation of a friend, and we were very glad we did.  The service is impeccable, the rooms are well appointed and immaculate and as the title suggests, the location was perfect. Our room over looked the courtyard so we were able to watch all the festivities, and there were lots!! Lots of great restaurants in walking distance and it is a very safe neighborhood.  I would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel Neri..",5,2015,05,26
14,"Excellent, couldn't have been better","Ideal location, stunning hotel, an oasis of tranquillity and quality right in the middle of Barcelona. The hotel blends the old history of the building very sensitively with modern comforts and excellent service.

Everywhere within easy walking distance.

The staff were incredibly polite and always attentive and helpful.",5,2015,05,26
14,Loved it,The Neri is a small hotel in the Gothic Quarter.  The gothic cathedral is practically around the corner and Las Ramblas is about a five minute walk.The staff was universally courteous and efficient.  The common areas were an interesting combination of old and new which is hard to describe other than to refer you their website.  We were in Room 305 (one of the rooms with a terrace) and loved it.  As we only at the restaurant for breakfast we couldn't rate it.,5,2015,05,25
14,"View of plaza, school and church","Our room overlooked the plaza in back with the school and church.  We enjoyed watching the people and the children going to school in the mornings.  We spent 3 weeks in Europe and Hotel Neri had the best breakfast ever!!  (we usually got there early so had no problem with getting a table)  Every table is given a platter with fruit, meats, cheeses and croissants (croissants were delicious).  There are also muffins, fruit and a couple of other offerings by the coffee makers- oh, also juices and water.  Besides all of this, you can order from a limited menu.  I had the pancakes one day- ummmm, wonderful!!  My husband had an omelette every day so thought I'd try one, too.  It was exceptional- the best omelette I've ever eaten!!!  The eggs weren't runny and the outside (both sides) were brown & crispy!!!  The location was good, within walking distance of many sights but as mentioned in other reviews- it's hard for cars to get to as the street is very narrow.  The staff was very friendly and helpful- they let me use a computer as I hadn't brought our laptop.  There was a coffee maker in the room (none of other hotels that we stayed at had them).  I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.",5,2015,05,25
14,Spain travel in May,"The hotel and the room were extremely dark with very little natural light. We had a suite whose windows were 5 feet from  the wall of another buiilding. We could see into their windows and they could see into ours. Not a single taxi driver knew of the hotel.  Taxi drivers were only able to find it with GPS.  When they did find it, they would not drop us off at the front door. They dropped us off at a nearby Plaza.  We absolutely would not stay there again.",1,2015,05,24
14,We Loved It!,"Hotel Neri was a beautiful, boutique hotel.  For us, it was in the perfect location in Barcelona. We loved it!  We had an amazing room, with a balcony overlooking the plaza. We felt like it was the ""best room in the house""!  It was our first trip to Europe, and people watching from our balcony really made us feel immersed in the culture. It was wonderful! The service was outstanding, and the dinner we had in the hotel restaurant was delicious. We loved Barcelona, and a big reason why was Hotel Neri!",5,2015,05,22
14,Neri there but not quite,"Its not cheap and we were supposed to be met at the train station. i eventually found the driver. The first room was tiny with no one to sort out. The breakfasts were in too small a room  Esther the GM was great, a suite, a birthday dinner on roof, Juans X 2 were great as were all the staff but as a luxury property it needs to be tuned by the owner or a really swiss trained GM. 

Maybe i prefer non boutigue luxury hotels",3,2015,05,20
14,Fantastic Location,"Beautiful Boutique Hotel with exceptional service! The property is beautiful and sophisticated with a hip vibe.The standard room we had was very small and because it faced the street and other buildings we could not open our curtains much for lack of privacy. This made a very tight room feel a bit suffocating. Make sure you get a room facing the little plaza in the back or a suite.Unfortunately those rooms were booked when we stayed there. The bathroom though lovely with its stone finishes is small and awkward. Great if you are not a woman and are traveling by yourself. Because we are of a certain age we felt the lighting was also a bit dim(perhaps just our age).
What the Neri does do exceptionally well is the attention to customer service. The staff is attentive and knowledgable and very caring. My husband had the unfortunate experience of becoming  ill and needed a doctor.We had so much help from Jacopo at the front desk. He brought in a doctor and was very concerned and attentive to our needs. We are very grateful for his help and the care he demonstrated.He is an invaluable representation of the Neri's customer service.When returning to Barcelona the Neri will again be our spot,hopefully with a larger room.",4,2015,05,19
14,Outstanding staff without question.,Your staff was the greatest.  From our welcome when we arrived to the breakfast server and the bartenders it was a most enjoyable experience. The local was awesome and we just felt so welcome and appreciated,5,2015,05,17
14,Charming hotel in Barcelona,"This is the very definition of a ""boutique"" hotel, where you feel pampered and you get personal attention : the staff went out of their way to attend to my every need and wish, the stiuation on the charming plaza in the back and the impeccable quality of the tasteful decor make it a very special landing in anotherwise beautiful but noisy city !",5,2015,05,14
14,Absolutely Fantastic - But!,"Hotel Neri is fantastic. Don't try and drive there, we went round in circles for over an hour trying to get down various one way walking streets. Call the hotel and work it out before hand. That said Neri is right in the heart of the old town and is a walk to everywhere. Beautifully restored and modernised it comprises only 29 rooms. The staff are attentive, the restaurant has great food, is not expensive and if I have understood my Spanish correctly, a discount of 15% was applied as we were house guests; our standard room well presented. The bathroom soaps and body lotions beautiful and the towelling expensive. Drinks are delivered to a roof garden which provides a limited outlook over the city.

Some things they have missed out on are; no vanity in the bathroom, just a basin fastened to the wall, admittedly an elegant basin but nowhere for my wife to put the hair dryer, hair rollers etc and the lights over the mirror swivel side to side and not front to back so no light on my lady's  face. Big mirror over the basin and another even bigger behind the bathroom door but none in the room itself. Big TV but only one easy chair. The other an upright. OK to watch from in bed. Avoid room 209 with these issues. Only two regular tea bags for an overnight stay, we provided our own for the morning cuppa. We had been advised that there was Nespresso coffee machines in each room, however this only applies to the mini-suites and not to the standard room. Pity really as a Nespresso machine is peanuts in the scheme of things and the hotel is not cheap so scrimping is a bit silly really. Breakfast was excellent although my soft boiled egg was too runny with the albumin not cooked. The Nespresso coffee was fantastic! 

Well worth the visit but check your room details beforehand.

",5,2015,05,13
14,"Quiet, Clean, helpful staff, excellent quality in the heart of Old Barcelona","This hotel is everything you need when traveling. In a 10 day tour of Europe and four hotels, I liked this the best. The quality and service from the staff was excellent. The breakfast included with your room was the best I have seen. They start you off with breads, fruits, pastries, then breakfast of your choice.",5,2015,05,13
14,Highly Recomend,"We arrived at Hotel Neri to a very warm and personnel service. We were seated in reception and offered us a complementary glass of wine. We were upgraded for one night and as it was our birthdays was also offered complementary breakfast. Our room was not available so we were able to take our wine to the roof top terrace bar to relax in the sunshine. The roof top is small but relaxing with the fragrance of the jasmine that covers the walls. Once in our room we was very pleased with comfort and cleanliness the beds were very comfortable. The hotel has a lovely relaxing atmosphere and the staff very friendly. My only disappointment was the breakfast room it was very small compared for the number of guest and we had to wait. The breakfast was very nice and plentiful. Drinks in the bar expensive but guess to be expected for hotel. Lovely stay would recommend highly and the location is fab. Take goid walking shoes as plenty of winding streets. Visit PLA restaurant recommendation of reception only 5 mins walk (if you don't get lost line we did) get the reception to explain exactly where it is as its up a dude street... Lovely atmosphere and food fab, hotel Neri a wonderful find and will go again. Barcelona we will return :-)",4,2015,05,12
14,Fantastic hotel in the heart of old Barcelona! We will be back for sure!,"We spent 5 days here for a birthday trip to Barcelona. We could not have made a better choice for a hotel. The service, room, and location are exceptional. All staff are super friendly, and they will surprise you frequently with little treats and extras. The concierges will help you book any museum or tour tickets as well as restaurant reservations. The building is an old Barcelona mansion - just gorgeous. We will be coming back to this city and staying here for sure!",5,2015,05,06
14,Artsy Renovation in Gothic Quarter,"Artful renovation seamlessly combines the historic building with creative, modern decor!  Gorgeous bathrooms and artwork!  Fabulous hotel staff is ready to assist with anything you need!  Location is absolutely perfect tucked away on a quiet lane in the heart of the Gothic Quarter with its array of boutiques, restaurants and historic buildings all within walking distance.",5,2015,05,06
14,Nice hotel perfect location,"Nice hotel, perfect location but expensive . Certainly the transfer from the airport to the hotel is very expensive, you better take a taxi. Furthermore, I had indicated that my wife was celebrating her 65th birthday in Barcelona , had expected some attention from the hotel. Need not be a cake or champagene but a card or something in the room, had been nice",4,2015,05,06
14,Already missing Hotel Neri,"This is the most beautiful and comfortable hotel I have ever stayed in--like having something so wonderful be even more wonderful than you ever expected. It's stunning location and decor are unparalleled and the level of comfort there are what dreams are made of. The personal service at Hotel Neri is all that one could ask for and they seemed to anticipate my needs. When we arrived, I was thrilled to be seated and a concierge/reception desk instead of being left to stand during check in when I was exhausted already. It got better--we were offered glasses of the best red wine I have had in ages. It was exactly what my body and soul needed after more than 24 hours of flying to get there.

If you have a chance to stay here, I highly recommend it. I found this hotel on my last trip to Barcelona a few years ago, quite by accident when my husband and I were out wandering the gothic quarter and got turned around. We ended up in the square, which is a very special location. I saved it in my memory for my next time in Barcelona, and made it happen. I plan to stay there again when I go back to Barcelona again. Both Barcelona and the Hotel Neri are locations for which one visit is definitely not enough!!",5,2015,05,05
14,Fantastic personal service at all times.,"A wonderful location, beautiful rooms and extremely helpful staff.  We would not stay anywhere else in Barcelona.  The breakfast was great and other meals can be found very close by due to the many tapas bars and restaurants within minutes of the hotel.",5,2015,05,02
14,Frienly and discrete politeness.,"This hotel is a well hidden secret. Within 100 meters of the Cathedral but quiet and secluded. Wonderful atmosphere, terrific service and a friendly and very polite set of staff.
Nothing is too much trouble.
The food is surprisingly good...far better than I expected.
A small boutique hotel that I would fully reccomend and would certainly stay in again. Delightful.",5,2015,04,29
14,Loved the Gothic Quarter Location,"We loved exploring the Gothic Quarter surrounding the hotel & also the Born district nearby. Both offer great walking streets & intriguing alleyways full of architectural delights! We also loved the hotel's rooftop deck to enjoy wine while watching the lovely sunset & hearing the birds singing. The front desk staff were very helpful with sightseeing & restaurant recommendations.  We enjoyed a wonderful dining experience in the hotel restaurant too. The unique & comfortable rooms offer every amenity to insure a comfortable stay.  It's recommended to reserve the taxi through the hotel for delivery to or pickup at the hotel, otherwise taxis will only come come as far as Sant Jaume Square for drop-off or pick- up services.",5,2015,04,28
14,"Incredible location, great hotel with an awesome staff",The location is incredible (a few blocks from the Cathedral) and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (fluent in English and great restaurant recommendations ).  Do not request a courtyard room if you want quiet as the school kids are loud and start early.  Besides that it was a phenomenal place,5,2015,04,27
14,Perfect hotel; Perfect location,"We are fans of small boutique hotels, thus Hotel Neri was perfect for our needs. The concierge staff as well as those who serve the breakfast were friendly, helpful, professional. Bed was the most comfortable of all our European trips! I was thrilled with the individually controlled A/C in each room.Location in the old Gothic area is ideal. We just came home from our 10 day stay at the hotel. I'm ready to go back!",5,2015,04,26
14,10 days at Hotel Neri,"The hotel was beautiful, clean and in a perfect location. The staff was extremely accommodating and the breakfast was served in a lovely room with a terrific presentation of food. We were two couples and had no complaints.",5,2015,04,24
14,11 year wait worth it,"We first spied the elegant Neri hidden in the centre of Barcelona in 2004. It looked stunning and was in such a fantastic and atmospheric location that I decided if we were lucky enough to visit Barcelona again we would stay there. We did - and loved everything about the hotel. The building is gorgeous , the location central but discrete, breakfast incredibly generous, rooms spacious with beautiful bathrooms with luxurious toiletries AND the staff are very friendly and helpful. I will not wait another 11 years to return!",5,2015,04,21
14,A gem a hotel,"Beautifully restored, attentive staff & unbeatable location in the middle of historic Barcelona. We especially enjoyed breakfast in the reading room. The concierge was invaluable in sorting out timings, tickets, dinner reservations. Intriguing shops a stone's throw away -- gelato, gramophones, gothic jewellery...",5,2015,04,18
14,Stunning Boutique Hotel,"Great Boutique Hotel, centrally positioned in the Gothic Quarter.
Upon entering the Hotel, the staff were welcoming and professional with a relaxed manner.  
The interior had been beautifully restored throughout both to the internal main areas and within the bedroom suites.
The beds were perfect and probably the best nights sleep i have ever had. 
The breakfast was great and quite different from a standard hotel breakfast.
All in all a very refreshing experience and I would have no hesitation in recommending this place to others.",5,2015,04,17
14,A perfect location in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter,"The hotel is located in Barcelona's gothic quarter, near the cathedral. This historic district is the perfect base for touring nearby Las Ramblas, the Barcelona Cathedral, the Picasso Museum, and the Boqueria mercado. The small hotel is well appointed with modern facilities and a very nice restaurant (with a great breakfast). The staff could not have been nicer, or more helpful.",5,2015,04,11
14,Gothic Revival,"Who would believe that you could find such an exquisite, quiet hotel tucked away in the heart of the Gothic quarter? The location is perfect with so much to see within walking distance. Full of character, the bedrooms are spacious and comfortable and the bathrooms  excellent. It would be hard to fault the friendly service and the very helpful advice re guides, restaurants and where to go - the lovely Marta comes with a star rating.

Access to the hotel down a narrow alleyway is not the easiest - well worth getting the hotel to arrange transport from the airport....our taxi reversed right to the front door.
Breakfast is a little unusual but very good - definitely include this in your stay.

But remember, this is small boutique hotel so if you are looking for gyms, jacuzzis and saunas, it might not be for you.",5,2015,03,28
14,"Perfect, Special Find","In the heart of the Barri Gothic, this old Roman structure was converted into a comfortable, modern hotel with spacious rooms (we had two adjoining rooms for family with teenager), a nice restaurant, and an ideal location to explore the City. Near the Cathedral and an easy walk to the ocean, Neri is close to the Picasso Museum, La Rambla, and plenty of twists and turns to explore in the local neighborhood.  The staff are friendly, patient with our stilted Spanish, and always close by to offer a refreshment or snack.  The decor is modern, the wi-fi is free, and the breakfast is plenty.  Don't be thrown off by the 'walking street only' location -- a taxi will get you to the nearest small plaza and then you're just a short walk to the front door.   And once you're there, you'll say 'this is great...glad we're here!"" Stay here to enjoy the old, quaint (and cool) Barcelona after accessing the new, cosmo Barcelona.",5,2015,03,26
14,Stunning mix of old and new in a boutique setting,"My wish list for a hotel in Barcelona included a location in the Gothic Quarter, plenty of old world charm with modern conveniences. My needs list included connecting rooms for our family traveling with teens.  Hotel Neri was able to beautifully fulfill both.  

One caveat:  finding the hotel the first time is challenging.  Our taxi from the train station would not/could not deliver us to the front door because of extremely narrow streets.  Take the hotel up on its offer to arrange a private car to pick you up.  It's well worth the money not to wander the streets with luggage searching for the hotel!!

With only a handful of rooms, the quietly efficient staff remembered what brand of scotch to serve us at the terrace bar, delivered a room service breakfast to our room and arranged a private car to return us to the train station.  Tapas and rioja on the rooftop were a wonderful way to wind down after a busy day spent touring.  We ate the set lunch in the hotel's restaurant twice and were not disappointed.",5,2015,03,18
14,Inside the heart of Barcelona,"The prior reviews are all correct in giving the Hotel Neri the highest marks for service. 
I did smile about the remark concerning only supplying one bottle of water in the room as we ran out after three of our four day stay!  I was tempted to take the aromatic orange or lime
water pitcher next to the delicious cookies in the lobby for a refill!  I would definitely recommend including the breakfast buffet as part of your room package. Although the
breakfast ""library"" area is quite small, the individual fruit and meat platter delivered to each
table is more than adequate and is in addition to what ever you wish to order from the
kitchen. The staff everywhere are lovely and so accommodating . If Marta happens to be at
the front desk, she is a delight to engage either in conversation or in my case problem
solving.
Many of my friends who have been to Barcelona commented that although the city was
fabulous they tired of the noise and bustle.No no no I exclaimed. Because of Hotel Neri's location in the Gothic Quarter ( which is like being back in the 12th century ) the noise
and bustle were like a ""Shadow in the Wind.""  I borrowed this description from Carlos Ruiz
Zafon's book The Shadow of the Wind"" which I highly recommend reading before visiting
Barcelona. The Hotel Neri's central location encouraged walking to all the great sites
knowing that upon your return, a medieval calm and quiet could be yours. No jousting
allowed in the lobby.",5,2015,03,18
14,A wonderful experience,"The other reviews say it all, a stunning hotel, professional and friendly staff and efficient service.  We staying in a room on the 3rd floor with a balcony on two sides.  Shortly after our  arrival we were sitting in the sun (well I was in the hammock), enjoying a bottle of Cava that we'd pre-booked. There was also a large mattress area on the balcony. Bliss!
The bed was incredibly comfortable and we didn't hear any other guests while in our room so very private.  Housekeeping ensure you have a constant supply of clean towels etc.
We will definitely stay again.  
Our one very tiny gripe was that you are supplied with a complimentary bottle of water on the first day but not again.",5,2015,03,17
14,Wonderful In Almost Every Way,"We have stayed at the Hotel Neri for each of the past four years and we love it more each time.  The location is great, the staff excellent and very helpful, the food is wonderful, and the rooms very comfortable.  We recomment it to all of our friends who travel to Barcelona.",5,2015,03,08
14,A hidden little gem,"We had originally booked at another hotel and then we came across the Neri square with this hotel nestled at one end and we immediately decided to change.
How glad we were.  We had a lovely junior suite on the top floor, overlooking the square, the decor and the beds were great, the breakfast delicious, the staff friendly and helpful, great perfume shop opposite so everything smelt so sweet, fabulous decor, and best of all the hotel recommended a fabulous guide, Raymon who gave us a great tour of Barcelona.",5,2015,03,05
14,Really nice!,"We stayed at the Neri for a week in May 2013. It is located in the Gothic district right next to the Cathedral. The room was really nice with lots of space for clothes. The restaurant wasn't our favourite in the city, but the breakfast was really good and not too expensive for an hotel. We loved to have a cocktail on the terrace at the back of the hotel or on the rooftop terrace. The only low point was the access. The streets are really small in the Gothic district so not all taxi drivers can get to the front door. I would recommend, if you have never been in the area, to ask the hotel for a pickup at the airport. It is more expensive, but at least you won't have to wonder the streets with your luggages looking for the hotel.",5,2015,02,24
14,Great Experience,"Best location in Barcelona.  Great mix of old and modern in a beautiful part of the city.  Neri has a friendly staff and we would stay there again.  The entry doors are beautiful and the hotel is near Ramblas, Picasso museum, the cathedral, shopping, tapas, etc.",5,2015,02,03
14,Perfect,It even smells good! Everything is perfectly thought out and service is impeccable.  Decor unbelievable-- perfect combo of old and new.  Room magnificent. Jacobo the Italian front desk man is absolutely wonderful. And on the most beautiful romantic square in Barcelona! Stay here!,5,2015,01,28
14,I will return,"A very comfortable and stylish hotel located in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona, that I wish to recommend to everybody looking for a nice and exquisite  place to stay. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant excellent. The rooms are spacious and well equipped (this was the second time I was there with my husband and son) and their calm environment ensures a peaceful rest. A place to go back!",5,2015,01,28
14,An Eclectic Mix of Gothic Charm and Contemporary Elegance,"We had 2 unforgettably beautiful nights at the Hotel Neri. 

Situated in the Barri Gotic, in a cobblestone alleyway, nestled in with small private residences and boutique shops, the Neri is perfectly located for exploring all that beautiful Barcelona has to offer.

Our deluxe room overlooked a quaint little square and the dappled sunshine through the trees provided lovely light into the room. A comfortable bed, a welcoming bottle of wine and fabulous décor in the room all made for a wonderful stay.

The entrance to the hotel is all storybook charm with an intermingling of medieval stonework and modern day style and comforts - perfect for this Gothic quarter location.

Breakfast was amazing - beautifully prepared, delicious food served in a lovely corner room, looking out onto the laneways – perfect for watching early morning Barcelona life in the Barri Gotic. 

Needless to say we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Neri very much.",5,2015,01,17
14,A tranquil  oasis in Barcelona,"Staying at Hotel Neri in the atmospheric Gotic quarter was a five-star experience from beginning to end. Long before we arrived, we had already experienced the generous assistance of several members of staff, through emails and phone calls, all focused on making our trip as easy and comfortable as possible. Throughout our stay, every need was anticipated and seen to, with utmost care and professionalism. The whole hotel breathes peace and tranquility - wonderful to come home to after an intense day in the city. Our room was extremely comfortable and the bathroom had a lovely spacious shower. Restaurant suggestions were excellent. The area was charming and close to everything. From now on its the only place I'll stay in Barcelona. ",5,2015,01,09
14,Fabulous Boutique Hotel in Perfect Location,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this stylish and beautiful hotel.  Our taxi dropped us off at a nearby square where we had a very short walk to the hotel.  This actually added to the experience of staying in this quaint tucked away hotel situated in the Gothic Quarter with its ancient narrow alleys.  The staff at the hotel are very, very nice and attentive and all speak English.  Room was modern, great size, comfy bed, great linens and the bathroom was beautiful, could have been a bit brighter for doing makeup though.  There are a lot of small and charming shops nearby and great tapas bars.  While staying at this hotel and a great tip for fellow travellers - we booked ahead a tapas walking tour with Barcelona Taste, definitely worth it, Jo, was our guide and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We loved this hotel and made our stay in Barcelona magical.",5,2015,01,08
14,Our best stay in Barcelona yet,"We've been to Barcelona 5 times, and always have fun. Stayed in various spots and really been disappointed, but this time around we were really wowed by Hotel Neri, in the Gothic Quarter. It's located in a maze of windy little pedestrian-only lanes, in an ancient part of the city. Lots of great history, centrally located and the rooms were very well appointed and comfortable. Some rooms have terraces (ours did, which was necessary for us to bring our pup). So get a terrace, it's worth it! We didn't eat at the hotel, except for breakfast, which was very good, and everyone there was super friendly and helpful.",4,2014,12,31
14,A Great Boutique,"A perfect location adjacent to the cathedral, on a quiet side street next to St. Felip square, in an area in which mainly only pedestrian traffic is permitted has to be very good and indeed it is. For walking excursions (and access to the public transit system and subway), the location is hard to beat. Restaurants abound (it really is hard to find a bad restaurant anywhere in Barcelona), and the great historic sites, galleries, churches and architecture of the city are within very easy walking distance. 

The staff is good natured and helpful and a bit personal engagement seems to go a long way toward loosening things up for guests early in the morning and again after a long day seeing the sights. Sign up for breakfasts at the hotel restaurant - you won't be sorry. 

The rooms are excellent - well appointed, comfortable, clean and fully equipped. There are some remarkable pieces of artwork littering the hotel and the rooms, and the architecture and (the very contemporary) interior design in general are terrific. This is one of the oldest areas of Barcelona, so you're in the midst of Roman-influenced buildings. 

Walking back to the hotel in the evening after a typically late Catalonian dinner is very special.",4,2014,12,21
14,Ahhhhh...,"What a truly wonderful experience.  you feel the oasis from the moment you step inside the large panelled door and glass enclosure.  The reception staff on hand always there to great you and tend to your needs.  The rooms were very well appointed and remained true to that overall sense of relaxation and decadence without going over the top. The bathroom continued on the decadent spa theme.  

The location was fabulous in the heart of the gothic quarter and easy access to all points of interest in the city.  A great location for setting out in this very walkable city.

Staff were fluent in English and very accommodating when I practised my Spanish.  They were able to recommend shops and dining suggestions to meet a wide variety of requests and tastes.  

The extra touch was the umbrella's they provided - very necessary as we visited at a time when rain was likely.",5,2014,12,10
14,"A real find, in the Barri Gotic","The staff were incredible, really polite, friendly and went the extra mile to help you out and suggest ideas of where to visit and dine. 

Our room was spacious, had everything you could need and lovely view onto the church courtyard next door, with it's Civil War history. The food was delicious, we didn't have breakfast at the hotel but did eat in the restaurant one evening as we were celebrating a birthday. The food had a little Heston twist, with quirky but fabulous ideas added to simple dishes. Would highly recommend. 

The only down side was being in the Gothic quarter, the streets are beautiful, charming and cobbled. So we could hear a lot of noise from the street below. 

Otherwise would recommend and stay there again, it was very easy to walk to Ramblas, Picasso Museum and the Boqueria market, as well as the metro station and Cathedral of Santa Maria del Mar.",4,2014,12,03
14,Cute but not 4 Star in all ways,"This location is great, the lobby is historic and beautiful. Romantic, with new cuisine restaurant.
We opted for a Jr. Suite with a patio on a upper floor. Deck looked right into neighbors and hanging laundry. The room was a little worn, not very big, nothing more than you'd get in a city hotel room. Besides the bed, a chair, with no room for luggage to speak of. The rooms are all contemporary, while only the lobby is part of the historic structure.
Not worth it, and asked to move.
They gave us a better room lower down, taller ceiling, more character, but nothing special. We went out and found a much better hotel for the same price.
The staff was firm that our 2 of 4 nights were non-refundable, so we stayed 2 nights. Staff was very nice, all men in gray sweaters with bow ties, in a office alcove off the lobby. Accommodating, but not ""being of service"", for a 4 star.
We wished to like it, but for the price and reputation of a Relaix and  Chateaux, it didn't meet up.
",3,2014,11,29
14,The Perfect Spot in Barcelona,"This former monastery in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, in a pedestrian only area, was perfect for my stay.  Most taxis drop you off at Plaza Jaume and you walk a small easy way to get to the hotel.  
The entrance tells you right off this is a special place and you're going to feel pampered.  Candles line the stairs and the colorful contrasts and textures of lamps and upholstered chairs is sensual. 
The staff is young, attentive to every detail and so friendly.  Upon arriving, I was offered water and a tour of the hotel's main areas for breakfast, dinning, the rooftop lounge and then my room.  My luggage was brought up shortly.  We use the word Boutique for this type of hotel but I'll offer up something more sublime when I think of it. 
My bed was the best.  But the stone lined shower with flecks of mica and the rain fixture that provided plentiful hot water exceeded my expectations.  Nothing in this room needing touching up or felt less than clean.  
I chose this location in part because I thought the pedestrian only area would remove me from city noise.  That was not entirely true because the stoney alleyways direct all the laughter and chatter of the many tourists, rolling carts and occasional street cleaning crew noises up.  That disappears after 1:00am and doesn't pick up until mid-morning.  Getting on track with the Barcelona life and timeframe will help mitigate this.  
The location is situated between two subway lines, which are very easy to figure out.  You are next to the castle of Ferdinand and Isabella and the Basilica.  Take yourself on a tour of the Roman ruins under this area!  
It is very easy to get lost in the Quarter, which is what I did on my first night.  But most people are friendly here and I felt safe.  As a mater of fact, the music that is going on in hidden places around here cause one to stop for 30 minutes or more to enjoy the moment with others sitting and listening. Places to shop and eat are numerous around here.  
The food at Hotel Neri also exceeded my expectations.  For 16 Euro a day, breakfast is provided, which I recommend if you're an early riser or you will look for a while elsewhere.  You can grab coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt and breakfast pastries yourself but shortly, you'll have a plentiful plate of fruit, meat, salmon, and a croissant delivered to your table.  You can order eggs if you need more. 
I had lunch in the back courtyard plaza one day that I'll never forget.  The cod soup, Hake (fish), and dessert were unbelievable and warranted a cognac afterwards.  But more than that, a solo guitarist played by the fountain, doves flapping and cathedral bells chimed while a slow snow of autumn colored leaves came down. I have rarely felt more fulfilled.  
Yes you can pay attention to the tourists, the kids running off to school, the bike tour passing through but that's up to you. I still felt I was under charged for this experience.  Treat yourself! 
Enjoy life, my friends! - Patrick",5,2014,11,14
14,A hidden Gem in the Gothic quarter,"My wife and I came to the Neri Hotel for a 4 days stay in October to explore Barcelona. What a positive surprise! The hotel location is just perfect in the middle of the Gothic quarter, very close to the Cathedral and all the small and interesting antique shops. We specifically enjoyed the modern touch in this perfectly renovated old building. In the room everything was working perfectly including the free Wifi. We enjoyed the roof terrace and specifically the EXCELLENT restaurant. We had very good, romantic dinner outside in the small and quiet plaza behind the hotel. The food was exceptional and the service impeccable and friendly. We can definitely recommend this small hotel if you are looking for a romantic experience in Barcelona.",5,2014,11,11
14,Top service from staff and great location!!,"I travelled here with my mum for a two night stay. We were given a very warm welcome and a drink whilst checking in and our bags were taken to our room for us. I found the safe a little tricky to use at times but the staff were on hand night or day to come and assist me. Any requests we had were promptly catered for and all staff we came across were extremely lovely. The room was very nice with very high ceilings and lovely modern fittings. We were amazed at how often our room was cleaned and stock of tea bags, shower gels etc were replenished as every day we came back a cleaner had been in and again after we had spent the evening out for dinner. The hotel is in the perfect location in the Gothic Quarter, with lots to see within walking distance and also a short walk to several of the Metro Stations. On the roof of the hotel is a lovely little terrace were you can sit and relax in the evening with a drink perhaps. All in all a great stay at a lovely boutique style hotel.",5,2014,11,10
14,Romantic Getaway in the heart of the Gothic District,"The previous chateau/castle has been artistically renovated into a modern trendy hotel and has a luxurious romantic ambiance throughout.  The room was stylish and beautifully furnished and decorated.  The bathroom was adorned with stone slabs providing the feeling of being in a castle and at the same time the chic fixtures provided a feeling of elegance.  At night they light up large candles in the hallway which creates an even more romantic setting.  

The breakfast was decadent and highly recommended.  The service was superb.  

I really liked being in the Gothic section where all the streets are narrow and windy where only the smallest of cars can squeeze through.  On my first day I thought it fun going running in the morning and trying to find my way back as it was literally a maze.  The location is perfect as most of the important museums, La Rambla and the seashore are within close walking distance.  You can take a bus from the airport which drops you off at Plaça de Catalunya and it is a 5 minute walk from there.

One day I did a walking tour of the Barcelona architecture and I found it impressive the tour guide stopped at the Hotel Neri to provide a few comments and examples of a typical old castle in the city.  It really is a great building.

On my first visit I booked one night on the recommendation of the Barcelona Tourist Bureau at the airport and loved it and the surrounding area so much I extended my stay to 2 weeks.  I've been back twice and sent my parents from the US here for a present on their 50th wedding anniversary.  I recommend the hotel as a must stay to all my close friends going to Barcelona.",5,2014,11,08
14,Beautiful property in a convenient location,"Barcelona is a wonderful city with architectural gems all over.  Hotel Neri is certainly one of them.  Direct access by taxi in front of the hotel is possible, though when we arrived the taxi driver dropped us off in a plaza.  Despite the large suitcase we were carrying, reaching the hotel was not a hassle and we found the property easily.  Upon leaving to the airport the hotel managed to arrange for a taxi directly in front.
Concierge/front desk was excellent and very helpful.  Patiently listened to our requests, made restaurant reservations, drew us a map, etc.  Room was good sized with a contemporary design.  The art pieces decorating the hotel was stunning, especially since I am lover of contemporary art.  Definitely lived up to my expectations.  Would return.",4,2014,11,04
14,Perfect location in the barrio historic,"As soon as you enter you are transported to another older world. The ancient villa has been beautifully restored with large comfortable rooms, a great rooftop bar, complete with hammocks, and a wonderful location next to the Cathedral. Most taxis will not take you to the door but will come when summoned on departure. The room overlooking the little square can be noisy with school children from about 9 am until 6 pm but they are a lively lot and the doors are solid if you tire of the screams of play.",5,2014,11,01
14,Perfect Barcelona Hotel,"We had 4 days in Barcelona and stayed at the Hotel Neri the entire duration. The location could not be more perfect. Central to everytthing in Barcelona. Converted old building and is now totally modern and extremely comfortable. Breakfast was incredibly delicious. Did not eat dinner in the restaurant, however, from what we saw, it looked really good. Rooms were large, and totally immaculate. Most significantly, the entire staff was muy amable.",5,2014,11,01
14,Gothic Gem,"The Hotel Neri was a perfectly selected special occasion hotel for our 30th wedding anniversary trip by our travel agent Carol Orton. 

If you deserve a special reward, or regularly enjoy traveling wrapped in elegant luxury this is a hotel worth staying at.  

Out room was beautiful, the bed heaven after a day of travel and the staff extremely well trained and professional. 

If you can't stay here be sure to try the restaurant! ",5,2014,10,31
14,My second stay was just as great as my first time.,"Beautiful Hotel in the perfect location of the Gothic Quarter. Nicely appointed, large and very quiet rooms. The breakfast is delicious and the staff is very helpful. You can walk to Las Ramblas and any number of great tapas restaurants from here. I will stay here again.",5,2014,10,31
14,WONDERFUL!,"This hotel is a special treat located in the midst of the Barri Gothic, a combination of two historic homes one of them an aristocrats palace from the 12th century. This is also a Relais & Chateaux property, a brand known for delivering great and personalized service. They have only 22 rooms and the feeling is both chic and comfortable in this spectacular location. The property has a rooftop garden where you can order from the bar and a gourmet restaurant on the ground floor. They share a lovely courtyard with St. Philip Neri church and school. The school closes up around five each afternoon and the restaurant places tables out in the courtyard shortly thereafter for cocktails or dinner. The old church looming across the square with the bullet riddled wall is unique a reminder of the Spanish Civil War.

A delightful breakfast is served in the library, hotel service was impeccable and the décor was stunning. Our room overlooked the small square and it was noisy; however, it was the noise of old Barcelona – children playing and laughing, late night guitarists working the café for a few euros, locals chatting as they pass to and from their homes. This is a grand property as it captures the life of the Gothic quarter. It gets our highest recommendation.",5,2014,10,30
14,A real Oasis in the heart of the Barri,"We spend a calm 3 nights here , it's perfectly situated in the Barri away from roads - be warned if you have mobility issues, you have to walk 5 mins from your transfer taxi to the front door.
The staff were charming and attentive and it was one of the nicest hotel suites we have ever had. The decor was very nice and up-to-date with a very comfy bed , lavish bathroom and even an espresso machine provided. We had a lovely view of the square outside from our 3rd floor window and could listen to the guitar buskers or violinists who set up there periodically, or shut the soundproof windows and enjoy silence in the heart of the city.
The roof terrace provided a nice bit of outside space and again , was very peaceful.",5,2014,10,29
14,Honeymoon stay,"Unbelievable hotel with the best location in the city. Steps from the Gothic Cathedral and in the heart of the Gothic quarter, this place is unbeatable. Cava (Champagne) waiting for us when we arrived was a nice touch! The accommodations were impeccable and the staff was incredibly helpful. They helped us get dinner reservations and also helped us get a rental car! Stayed in the room with bathtub and king bed, it was worth the upgrade! The breakfast was delicious and the rooftop lounge was sweet! Will never stay anywhere else. LOVE hotel Neri.",5,2014,10,27
14,Lovely,A wonderful apartment in the best part of the old city. Fantastic hotel staff make the stay a very enjoyable one. Would definitely stay here again when we visit this great city. It is very close to the main section of the old city. If you like luxury in a good location this is the place.,5,2014,10,19
14,"Upscale, yet friendly and perfect location","Do not believe Rick Steve's comments about this hotel being a bit pretentious. It is warm and friendly, upscale but not at all snobby. We had a great room with a lovely balcony, complete with hammock. The room and bath were both excellent. The hotel is located in the oldest part of Barcelona, a real treasure. This hotel stay was one of the highlights of our entire Europe trip. There is a funky jewelry shop right next door--a must to visit, even if you don't buy!",5,2014,10,15
14,"Lovely boutique hotel, excellent location and service","We stayed at Hotel Neri for 3 nights in September and were very happy with our choice due to the excellent central location, nice small hotel combining an old historic building and modern amenities, as well as very friendly and efficient hotel staff providing 5 star (yet unobtrusive) service. The rooms were spacious and well maintained. The breakfast was excellent, consisting of fresh juice, eggs made to order, various fresh local produce such as cold cuts, fruits, yogurts, cheeses and baked pastries. The only difficulty we had was with finding the hotel upon arrival since the taxi driver (as others have pointed out) did not know where it was located. We were dropped off a few blocks away and had to walk around till we found it. We had a great time in Barcelona and big part of this positive experience was due to staying at hotel Neri.",5,2014,10,13
14,Couples Holiday,"I was referred to this hotel by a local I worked with. It did not disappoint. Lovely bed, linens that make you want to stay in bed all day. Beautiful bath with two shower areas and elegant slate wall to ceiling. Staff was like staying with family. Try to get an upper floor. Ours looked out over the court yard where we were put to sleep nightly with local musicians . They gather there for the acoustics, but then we thought could thid actually happen every night? Violinists one night, chello the next......it was a serial place. A visit of a lifetime. Oh don't miss the intimate rooftop garden bar especially at night",5,2014,10,12
14,Great boutique hotel in heart of old town,"My wife and I spent 5 nights here in rm 304 for 348EUR/ nt incl breakfast. Very nice decor. Super convenient location; we went back multiple times a day for nap, drop off purchases, etc. We basically ate two meals a day, relying on yummy breakfast. Wife loved pancakes. There is a courtyard in the back with a school but our room on the side was very quiet. Did not make use of terrace because it didn't really have a view. Concierge very helpful with recs for meals or planning route, choosing metro stops. Was expensive due to location but given how central it is and how little walking traffic right outside your door it had the advantages of access without the throngs/night-time noise of busier streets. Would definitely go back. ",5,2014,10,11
14,A lovely boutique hotel in the best location of Barcelona,"We had a wonderful 4 Night stay in this beautifully private hotel in the best place of Barcelona - the Barri Gotic. This hotel has that very special atmosphere you cannot find in the bigger hotels. The staff is very friendly, discreet and helpful. We had a standard room which had all the facilities one could expect and a super comfortable bed with beautiful hand picked linen. The breakfast was very nice and we found the library (where the breakfast is served) cozy and a perfect place to start the day and the roof terrace a perfect place to stay for a drink or two until diner is served.... Hope to come back soon!",5,2014,10,09
14,Superb short break,"Stayed at the Neri for 3 nights with 2 adult daughters and parents in law in 3 rooms. The hotel is small boutique hotel with everything to a very high standard with superb staff,rooms and good food. I suppose if I had one critacism the restaurant menu was rather small on choice but none the less well prepared. Yes as previously pointed out by previous reviewer there is a junior school nearby but this is not a reason not to stay here!",5,2014,10,08
14,Classic boutique hotel,"Wonderful location in the Gothic quarter. Within walking distance to local attractions and excellent restaurants. Staff made this stay very enjoyable Thank you Minot, Marta, and Juan (JJ) they went out of their way every day to be helpful.  The junior suites are are comfortable and well appointed. Breakfast buffet a little high at 16 euros, but well done and a good way to start the day. The lounges off the restaurant and on the roof top were great spots to end a long day of sightseeing.",5,2014,10,04
14,"Don't go, so noisy you can't sleep!","I've been to many fancy hotels, but this one has defenitely been the worst. Problems with the keys, roomservice. Nothing is flawless. But the worst thing is the noisiness. There is a kinder garden some where near by, and uh, the cacophony is horrible. You can't sleep siesta even you have earplugs. You have to wake up at 8 when the kids come, so bye bye nightlife. Never coming back! U should not come either. I recommend Casa Fuster or Ohla, both great hotels.",1,2014,10,02
14,Little Gem,"Tucked away in the Gothic quarter, a small boutique hotel with friendly staff and comfortable accommodation. It is centrally located for sightseeing and walking distance to a lot of sights. The roof top bar is a great little space for starting or ending your night and they will even bring you drinks outside of normal operating hours, should you ask for it. We didn't eat at the restaurant as we prefer a cooked brunch to the usual continental breakfasts on offer by European hotels, so couldn't comment on that. We found that, for the service and level of accommodation, this hotel offered good value for the rates charged. We will definitely stay here again and will recommend it to friends.",5,2014,09,29
14,"Great location, lovely staff, good boutique hotel","We had a good stay at Hotel Neri and the location was perfect for walking and exploring the city. You would need to get taxis for some essential sights/activities, and the hotel arranged our evening cabs, but you can leave the hotel everyday and see new things and then get a taxi once you've had some breakfast and feel like sitting down!

The staff were nice and Marta at reception was particularly helpful. The bar served good drinks and the service was good. The plaza at the back of the hotel where you could eat and/or drink was really delightful. It had 3 interesting historical facts about it involving Gaudi, Franco and Woody Allen. My room looked out onto the plaza and it was lovely to wake up to. Lots of people walked through there over our trip including newlyweds having their photos taken there, which was nice.

The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious, quiet and clean. There were some hangers but needed a few more. The TV was very big and had various world news channels. There was a portable Nespresso coffee machine which I had to move onto the desk for power, there was a lovely jar of sweets in the mini bar and tea bags also in the room.
The bathroom was lovely and the shower was great. The toiletries were really nice and dressing gowns were really very comfortable and high quality.

The main thing that I would've changed would be the lighting in the bathroom, it is typical boutique style though, just not practical for applying make up! The lift is very small and only one for the hotel. The service on the rooftop terrace was a bit too slow to ignore, it took 30 minutes to get our drinks but it was a lovely terrace. The food we had at the restaurant in the hotel wasn't amazing so I'd only use the hotel again as there's so many amazing restaurants in Barcelona. The front door automatically locks and so needs someone at the desk to open it. Sometimes there would be a delay and we had to ring the buzzer, just a minor irritation.

If you want to be located in this area of Barcelona I would definitely recommend this restaurant and confident you'd have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The rooftop terrace was lovely in the sun and the hammocks were fun.",4,2014,09,27
14,"Lovely hotel and location, service average","We only stayed one night and the hotel was occupied by a wedding and we definitely felt like third class citizen not being able to used the common areas such as the restaurant, bar.  The staff didn't handle the situation as we had expected from other hotels in the Relais and Chateaux group.  Our room was pleasant enough with a very tall ceiling and nicely designed as you would expect from a boutique hotel in this price range.  It's in a pretty part of the old town.",4,2014,09,24
14,Barcelona beauty,"My husband & I stayed at Hotel Neri for six nights in September. The hotel is very nice & the staff friendly & helpful.
The safe was difficult to operate & the breakfast was disappointing.  The dinner at the restaurant was very good & the rooftop terrace was a nice place to have an evening drink.
I would recommend the hotel as it was nice & good location.",4,2014,09,22
14,A try hard to be cool let down,"My husband and I stayed at the Neri Hotel for 3 nights earlier this month. Off to a bad start  with a pre hotel booked taxi no show. Then sticky floorboards between the bed and bathroom, every window curtain required closing if we wanted any degree of privacy however the bathroom curtain fell short of the ledge so my husband's private part whilst standing at the toilet was in view of the windows on other side of narrow laneway. The breakfast was almost comical. The self service part i.e. teas, coffee machine, cereals, uncut whole fruit, toaster are all housed in a cupboard! Not very user friendly and poorly lit. Great location but hotel itself a disappointment.  ",3,2014,09,21
14,We celebrated our wedding here and spent two nights,"Hotel Neri is a very special place. It is located in the heart of old Barcelona next to the most beautiful place of Barcelona (Plaza St felip Neri). We celebrated our wedding at the hotel. It was a small event with only 45 lunch guests and 80 cocktail guests. The hotel and restaurant staff are great and very professional. All went as planned and requested.

 We also spent two nights there. The rooms are nice, the amenities as they should be. The hotel is perfect for people that want to discover Barcelona. The food is great and the rooftop terrace a perfect place to end the day with a glass of cava.",4,2014,09,01
14,Lovely to end our holiday there in Spain,"We found this hotel à la derniere minute. All the hotels in Barcelona were fully booked at that time since it was the peak of summer. It was not difficult to get to the hotel as it is located within walking distance from many major tourist area but we were driving, we had some difficulty locating it initially. The concierge was very friendly and patient as I had to call him twice to ask for help to locate the hotel. And when we reached the hotel, there was only 1 person at the reception and we had to wait quite a while before we were attended to. I guess the person before me had many questions to ask. Anyway, everything was lovely and a breeze after. The rooms had lovely toiletries and the rooms are generous in size. The beds were comfortable and we slept well. They had provided extra towels and toiletries in the room for our kids without being asked. Though breakfast was not available at 7am sharp, the nice gentleman who was setting it up was quick to bring food the table as soon as he could. They had this amazing freshly baked churros and mini melt in your mouth donuts for breakfast, as well as iberico ham...a nice touch indeed. And as we were a group of 6, they offered to get us a larger taxi without us asking. Such initiative and thoughtfulness is what make boutiques hotels like Neri stand out from the rest. 

Lastly, I want to share the magical surrounding the hotel is located in. It is but a short walk to the La Rambla, to the square where pedestrians and tourists walk freely, lots of shopping, near the historical cathedral. In the evenings, despite being in the mid of the city, the place is calm, romantic and entertaining esp if you have kids needing some distractions. There are street performances, informal impromptu choir of a group of bicylces, a guy performing with large bubbles to the sound of magic.  I wish we could have stayed longer. Till the next time.",5,2014,08,31
14,a great hotel hidden in the gothic area of Barcelona,"A very nice, historic hotel in an awesome area. The décor of the hotel was very unique, but cool in a way. The room was very clean and spacious, but the lighting was a bit of a problem. The lights through out the entire room, including the bathroom, were very dim. Thus making simple tasks like reading before bed or applying makeup quite difficult. Regardless of the lighting issues, our stay was fantastic, the room was very cleanly, the staff was helpful and fulfilled every single on of our requests, and the location of the hotel was great with many delicious cafes and restaurants near by.",4,2014,08,29
14,Boutique Barcelona at it's Best,"This a magical place to stay with beautiful artwork and decorations to make the rooms quite unique. Great location in a very quiet corner in the Gothic area (so much so that it can be hard to find). I did not sample the food here but will be sure to do so the next time I stay. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom spotless. 
My only regret was I did not have my wife with me on this occasion but will be sure to bring her the next time I stay.",5,2014,08,23
14,Extreme Luxury at a Price,"The Neri is everything one could hope for.  Luxurious down bedding, a decadent rainfall shower with room for 4, a fine restaurant on the seemingly private square, Placa de Sant Felip, and a doting staff.  The entrance is elegant, the rooftop bar is an oasis of verdant civility replete with a small bar and hammocks along with the requisite cafe tables and chairs.  The small terrace overlloking Carrer de Sant Sever was not large enought to stand on but it was a literal door into the romantic view of the narrow street below which tipifies ""El Barri Gotic - the old town.  You can't taxi directly there but it is a short walk from Carrer del Bisbe The only possible thing we could say about our stay was the price.  Subscribing to the theory that you get what you pay for - I can't complain _ I will just say ouch. We transferred hotels after being elsewhere in Barcelona for the first two days and we were so happy we did.  It's fairly central to the Gothic neighbor, very romantic, and will be remembered as one of the high points of our Spain trip.",5,2014,08,20
14,A delight.,"My wife and I recently escaped for a few precious days away in Barcelona. We stayed for three nights at the Hotel Neri and we could not have been happier with our experience. The hotel is beautiful, easy to find, well appointed, if you are lucky enough to have a room at the back of the hotel, overlooks a small, but deeply historic square. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathroom remarkably spacious and the public areas have the feel of a private home, rather than a hotel. The location of the hotel is pretty much perfect to explore the whole of the city - it is next to the 'old' cathedral and the Gothic quarter, but close to major transport links in the Placa Catalunya. We didn't sample the delights on offer in the restaurant, there was almost too much choice to be had a brief stroll away through the streets and alleyways of the old town. The breakfast, however, comes highly recommended.
The staff couldn't have been more helpful and, should we come this way again, we would not hesitate to go back to this beautiful hotel. 

The rat with wings in the shop window next door is a bit creepy though...",5,2014,08,20
14,What a Barcelona hotel should be!,"We decided to stay in a property that wasnt a large chain and wow, are we glad we did!  If you want a true getaway and an escape from the hustle and bustle, this is the place.  The staff was very friendly and accomodating and made you feel at home.  The room was nicely appointed with great attention to detail on keeping the European tradition and making the experience the best.  You are just steps away from shopping, food, people watching.....you name it.  If you are looking for a romantic getaway, let this be the place.  Oh, and the food is wonderful too.  My coworker suggested Hotel Neri and I am glad she did!",5,2014,08,15
14,Hotel Neri,"This boutique medieval hotel is nestled in the gothic quarter of Barcelona. It is superbly located - not too far away from anything. The staff are incredibly friendly and go out of their way to accommodate you with your requests. The rooms are modern and delightful.  We stayed in room 304.  Our travel buddies stayed in room 305 which is bigger but the size wasn't an issue. The bed and bedding is amazingly comfortable. The bath is deep and very relaxing after the long day of exploring. We had a sun bed on our balcony with a hammock. The food and service is excellent. When we come back to Barcelona, we will definitely stay here again",5,2014,08,14
14,Gothic Brilliance,"We stayed here for 3 nights from the 9th of august, having asked our travel agent to find us something boutique and unique and this certainly met the bill. It's tucked away in the back streets near the Cathedral, in the heart of the Gothic quarter and the rear terrace sit's into a very charming and traditional square. The hotel itself partly dates from the 13 century, however it's been renovated to the highest standards and maintains a lot of original charm. Upon check in we where greeted with a complimentary drink and our room was ready early (a nice change). We stayed in room 302, which was a junior suite, whilst not that big it was well proportioned, had a very nice bathroom and excellent views on to the square at the back of the hotel. The design was modern but tasteful. overall room quality was good. The food at the restaurant downstairs is excellent and very good value for money. Whilst the small nature of the hotel means it does not have all the facilities you would expect in a larger hotel (gym, pool, etc), the food and service where excellent and the 24 hour room service is unusual for a smaller hotel. The staff where charming, attentive and very friendly and certainly did a great job at making us feel welcome and relaxed, they even went as far as to print out and give a recipe to my wife after she had eaten the same dish at lunch 3 days in a row, which was a great touch. The hotel has lot's of character and I firmly recommend it if your looking for a base to explore Barcelona for a long weekend. 

One tip- If arriving at the hotel by taxi, get the hotel to book it as the Gothic quarter is difficult to enter via car and lot's of taxi drivers won't take you to the hotel (as we found out on arrival), which can make it difficult to find. 

Overall- This is a very unique and special hotel, well run, great staff, good location and I can't find fault with it (unusual for me).",5,2014,08,12
14,Just Superb,"Fabulous hotel in a great city, Neri has it all. Excellent location, superb design and fttings, brilliant staff. We stayed four nights and enjoyed every moment.  The rooms are very funky but well equipped, and if there is anything you need its there in 2 mins. 
The breakfast is magnificent, more like staying at an indulgent friends' house. A platter of everything local arrives ( ham, cheese, superb croissants, yoghurt, fruit) and then you can order whatever you might like. Add to this a Nespresso machine and it will soften the heart of any regular traveller.
our little girl managed to cut her headand required stitches and the hotel calmly called a doctor to the room to sort her out. Oh, and then followed up with a little cake for our daughter to wish her a recovery. Nice touch.

The sampling menu which we took in the package was excellent, and I for one have not had gold leaf pork scratchings before ! 

We also did a private gothic quarter tour with a local Estrelle  which was great fun and at a nice pace of our own choosing.

We won't be telling too many people about this hotel so we can sneak back anytime....",5,2014,08,08
14,Exquisite,"This a truly exquisite hotel! The charm & elegance does not disappoint. The customer service was exceptional. We had a beautiful family suite, which was 2 rooms with a hallway. The rooms were very modern & spacious with a view overlooking the square. The rooftop terrace was lovely. Breakfast provided excellent service with delicious food.  This hotel deserves 5 stars. Wishing charm, elegance & an excellent location, I highly recommend!",5,2014,08,05
14,Exceptional Hotel,"Hotel Neri met or exceeded all expectations for our vacation. Family of 5: elderly mom, sisters and husbands. Exceptional staff and service, lovely room and bathroom, room temperature ideal. Kudos to the Hotel Neri staff! 
P.S. July 1, 2014, was our arrival date and, coincidentally, the taxi strike day. Hotel Neri was not easy to find. With the help of a woman on the AutoBus, we exited the bus at the closest plaza (Catalunya), and then with the help of a kind medical van driver we arrived at the hotel with all luggage in tow. If you do not know Barcelona and/or you are traveling with an elder, I would highly recommend a more convenient (albeit expensive) shuttle service like SunTransfers (who was on strike on our arrival date but who worked out perfectly 4 days later taking us to the airport).",5,2014,07,20
14,Hotel Neri,"An incredibly beautiful hotel with very helpful staff. One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Right in the middle of the gothic quarter, a stunning location. Breakfast and lunch were very good and the rooms had amazing character. Licensed musicians play in the corridors in the evening and quite the experience acoustically. Close to many very good restaurants, in fact so many it is tough to make a decision on where to eat. We highly recommend going to the open air boqueria. The food stalls are unbelievable. Would recommend a half day tour and then pick favorite spots to return. Can't go wrong - whether shopping, eating, or touring the Gaudi locations (if that's your thing). FC Barcelona tour was also great. Only complaint were the load folks outside our window from 2:30-4am. Was rough waking up for an early flight. Should have called the front desk to call the police. Our bad.",5,2014,07,13
14,Charming boutique hotel,"The Hotel Neri was the perfect place to start our vacation.  Centrally located in the Gothic quarter, the hotel provides a great combination of style, charm and amenities. 

We booked the hotel's sole suite, which consisted of two rooms with a sliding wood door between the rooms.  The bathroom was large and well appointed with shower over bath combo.  We wanted a suite with a separate room because we have a four year old son, but those traveling without children or children old enough to have their own room may want to consider other rooms.  The downside of the suite is that it is on the first floor of rooms and as such quite dark (despite two large windows that open into a narrow alleyway).  

The hotel itself is quite charming and the in room amenities were great.  Complimentary bottles of water are provided on a daily basis. 

We didn't eat breakfast at the Neri; it would have cost 25 euro extra.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk to La Boqueria, which offers much better breakfast value and selection than the breakfast offered by Neri. 
 
The extra charge for breakfast, as well as the extra charge for a bed for our son and the resulting extra bill at check-out, left us fealing nickel and dimed.  Other hotels of the same class didn't charge extra for either.     ",4,2014,07,05
14,Fantastic place to stay,"For our first trip to Barelona we were looking for somewhere central to stay but wanted to avoid big, Western-style hotels. The Hotel Neri was the perfect solution. Situated next the Barcelona's cathedral along a narrow alley in the gothic quarter, and backed by a pretty square, its location could not have been more charming. The staff were warm, welcoming and highly efficient, with fantastic recommendations for places to eat. The rooftop drinks area (leafy and sheltered with rambling jasmine) was an oasis of calm on hot afternoons. The room (a junior suite on the first floor) was spotlessly clean and stylishly presented - although at times a bit dark because of the nearness of neighbouring buildings across the side alley. Overall a great place to stay.",5,2014,07,02
14,A gem of a place hidden in the magically enticing Gothic Quarter,"Our experience started with the extremely helpful staff via internet. Thanks Claudia!!!
It continued with a lovely pick up and transfer from the airport and only got better. Jacopo was so friendly when we arrived and we immediately loved the soothing, artsy feel to the hotel that couldn't be in a better location. Our room was clean, comfortable and vibey. We loved the roof deck for a glass of cava but skipped breakfast as we never woke up in time. Walking out the door into the old city led to one incredible adventure after another: street musicians, hidden courtyards, tapas bars and old churches. Barcelona is a feast for the senses and Hotel Neri the perfect retreat to experience it all from.",5,2014,07,02
14,Super boutique hotel in the medieval quarter Barcelona,"We stayed at the Neri for 4 nights and very comfortable nights they were too. The hotel is small, intimate & stylish. The staff are excellent - nothing was too much trouble. 
The breakfast was delicious and you must make use of the roof terrace - Cocktails and tapas on a sunny afternoon away from the hustle & bustle of the city.
The rooms are spacious with a large comfy bed. You are in the centre of the city and there is some noise at night, but you can always close the window & put on the AC - it's not too noisy!
I would highly recommend this tucked away little gem.",5,2014,07,01
14,"Great location and friendly staff, lovely hotel","Hotel Neri is next to the cathedral in the pedestrian Gothic quarter. Everything is near and the building is wonderful. The room was big (junior suite) and very clean. ceiling was amazing. The service was very good and staff very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast is well worth it.
The 2 negatives is that it can be noisy. There were a lot of school trips and these children can make a lot of noise from early in the morning til late! We were on the 1st floor. However, on Saturday, it was pleasantly quiet. The second thing is that as you are very central the next buiding is not that far away so you have to keep the curtains closed most of the time if you want any privacy and perhaps the room and bathroom could do with some extra lights.

However, overall, we were very happy with our stay and would highly recommend the hotel.",4,2014,06,27
14,"Location, location, location","The Hotel Neri is in the Barri Gotic, the largely pedestrian old part of the city.  It is not easy to find but, once you do, this is a modern, lovely 22-room  Relais et Chateau in an old building.  Our room has a view of the little Plaza Filip below and a Catalan school across the way.  We stayed for 3 days and were very comfortable througout.",5,2014,06,16
14,Close to perfect,"Hotel Neri has an amazing location, tucked away in a quiet street within Barcelona's Gothic Quarter - around the corner from the cathedral. The hotel is modern and well-equiped whilst making the most of its historic location with a stone facade. The cute rooftop garden complements the stylish lobby and sizeable rooms. The only drawback was occasionally frosty staff (seems to vary by individual) - otherwise we had a delightful time. One of the best hotels I have stayed in but falls just short of perfection for some intangible reason...",5,2014,06,12
14,Simply the best,"The location is perfect, in the heart of the Gothic quarter and just a few steps from the cathedral. The hotel is beautiful, a historic monument in itself and decorated in the best possible taste. There are relatively few rooms, which gives it a warm, intimate and friendly atmosphere. There are all the usual amenities, including free WiFi; and the staff couldn't be more efficient and welcoming. One word of caution: because the hotel is located in an area of very narrow streets, some taxi drivers refuse to take you all the way to the hotel. The hotel itself offers a pickup from the airport. BecUse it was relatively expensive (80 euros as opposed to a taxi fare average of 40), we didn't take the offer up. This meant that we were dropped a few hundred yards from our destination - and then got lost for half an hour! Our advice is to take the hotel shuttle there and then, on the way back, ask the hotel to order a taxi driven by someone they know is willing to come to the hotel front door.",5,2014,06,03
14,"Location, Location","we stayed at the Hotel Neri in Barcelona for over a week this past May, our experience was wonderful, the location could not have been better, near the cathedral and la rambla but far enough away from the bustle.  The staff was always cheerful and helpful.  We especially liked the roof garden for a cup of coffee in the morning and wine in the evening,  The decor in the upstairs hallway was whimsical and the entrance of the hotel charming,  if we had one complaint it was that the room was dark.  Our room overlooked the square of the school where Gaudi attended as a child, very charming but a little noisy with the kids.  We did not mind it at all but if you might be concerned ask for a different facing room..  Loved the hotel Neri and Barcelona",5,2014,05,28
14,Unbelievably great hotel,"An old palace in Gothic area of Barcelona converted to a 22 room boutique hotel. Amazing building, best location right in the heart of old Barcelona.
Fantastic staff...nothing is a trouble
Truly the best small hotel I have ever stayed at anywhere in the world",5,2014,05,28
14,Lovely Hotel in Gothic Center,"Beautiful boutique hotel.  Very good breakfast available and good value.  All category of rooms are lovely.  Did not think the difference between  a regular room and Junior  suite was worth the price as it was only slightly bigger.  The bathroom, however, was quite impressive.  
The roof top bar area is a nice option for evening coffee or drinks.
The only problem for this hotel is the noise.  At times, the street noise can be quite loud.",4,2014,05,28
14,Worst hotel experience,"We booked a specific room for our wedding night 4 months ago and, when we arrived there after a marvelous wedding, they told us we had to go to another room (a sad, poor and charmless room) because of ""technical issues"". These ""technical issues"" meant that, ignoring the fact we had booked the room a long time ago for our first wedding night, they had given our room to someone else unscrupulously. Completely lack of professionalism. Don't expect much from a hotel with this behaviour but do visit, indeed, San Felipe Neri square because it's a magical place in Barcelona.",1,2014,05,24
14,"Nice Room, Great Staff, Great Location","Hotel staff was excellent, always polite and helpful. Hotel location was close to everything in the center of the city, beach was a short metro trip if you didn't feel like a walk. Room was decent, no complaints.",4,2014,05,15
14,Wonderful wonderful hotel!,"We recently had the pleasure of staying 5 nights at this fantastic hotel. We couldn't fault anything! Location, service, room, bed.....all were perfect. We paid for the in-house breakfasts, and we're glad we did. It is so nice to be able to wander downstairs into the library in the morning for a leisurely breakfast, then return to our room to freshen up before the day's exploring. We would certainly recommend the Hotel Neri to anyone visiting this wonderful city.
PS. If there on a weekend, make sure to find time for a quiet wine in the outdoor square behind the hotel in the evening - the ambience, lighting and 'mood' are exceptional.",5,2014,05,15
14,well worth the money,"My 13-year old granddaughter and I just spent 2 nights at the Neri.  Location is perfect if you are tour-walking the historic city.  The concierge was very helpful, as were the rest of the staff.  One of the breakfast servers even gave me the recipe for the anise cake the Hotel serves at breakfast.  Our room had plenty of space to afford us each some privacy and was very clean.  Given the cost of other hotels in Barcelona and the fact that we saved quite some money on taxi fare, the Neri is well worth the cost.",5,2014,04,20
14,Luxurious and full of character,We stayed for 4 nights and thought it was the best combination of charm and luxury with a few funky twists added in. Its in a nice location in the Barri Gotic down narrow pedestrian (mostly) streets. The room was very large and had 2 balconies. The concierge was very helpful with restaurant and other recommendations.,5,2014,04,08
14,Sweet spot in the Gothic Quarter,"This is a first class hotel in the Gothic quarter, one of the most picturesque sectors of Barcelona. Considering Barcelona hotel prices, we found this reasonably priced. Service was very good, with staff members from across Europe, all of whom spoke excellent English. Food, as befits a Relais & Chateaux member, is refined and well prepared, though we only ate there at breakfast and tapas. Some may find it a drawback that the hotel is in a pedestrian zone, so the taxi has to drop you off a couple blocks away, in a busy square, and you need to carry your luggage to the hotel. However, one advantage of that is that it's a quiet spot away from traffic noise. Barcelona is a wonderful city and we would stay here again on a return visit.",4,2014,04,08
14,Charming Hotel,"We just completed a four night stay at Hotel Neri.  The location in the Gothic section - and overlooking a historic courtyard and school was especially charming.  Fodors refers to the noise from the courtyard, and that is true - but it was the sound of children playing and we found this enjoyable.  Our room was spacious.   We had breakfast each morning in the hotel and it was ample.  Most notable above all was the incredibly attentive and gracious staff.",5,2014,04,04
14,Lovely Hotel,"My husband and I just spent four nights at this charming hotel and it was perfect. The location is superb, right in the heart of Old Town Barcelona. It is a pedestrian area with all the charm of old Europe. The hotel is in a beautiful historic building and is perfectly run. The rooms are spacious, modern and well equipped. The small breakfast room was charming and the food was good. The staff were extremely accommodating and helpful. ",5,2014,03,15
14,Absolutely fabulous!!,"We stayed there for a long weekend (thursday - sunday) to explore Barcelona. My partner has never been to Barcelona before, and I couldn't have picked a better place. The location is absolutely perfect. Located in the middle of the Gothic part of Barcelona. Couldn't believe how quiet it was. Could easily sleep with the windows open. Advise you to ask for a corner room, which allows you to have two small balconies. The staff was very friendly and helpful in any way possible. Definitely worth taking the breakfast. Really made with love, all small plates assorted on a tray. Really nice and yummie! The roof terrace was simply magnificent. You can order what ever you like up there, and even enjoy a nice nap in the two hammocks which are in one of the corners of this big and beautiful terrace. Also the rooms are equipped with the best thick curtains, which allow you to sleep in if required. The bathrooms are super clean and we had this amazing nice rain shower. Only thing I would do is always take out the electricity card when not in the room. The lamps really heat up when left on. This hotel will definitely be our pick for any future visits planned to Barcelona. Thanks again to all the staff!!",5,2014,03,12
14,The Neri is good ...,"The Neri is a not-cheap-even-in-February but really nice small hotel in a fun building in the old historic quarter of Barcelona a few minutes walk from La Rambla – if that’s what you want! Some rooms are much nicer than others – ours on the 3rd floor wasn’t great – and the breakfast is a bit eccentric. You have to scrabble about in a dark cupboard trying to operate the Nespresso machine [and read the Nespresso labels in the dark] but the cake is terrific. There’s no sitting room but any [v.mild!] moans are much more than outweighed by the sheer niceness, friendliness and professionalism of the staff – faultless in every way. They all deserved 11/10 ... if not a bit more.  So yes, the Neri is REALLY nice.
[We didn’t try the restaurant but heard v good reports of it]",4,2014,03,07
14,"Superb: Great location, wonderful service, beautiful building","We are currently visiting Barcelona and staying at the Hotel Neri in the Barri Gotic.  The hotel is is an old palazzo on a charming street and very centrally located.  After reading about difficulties getting a taxi to the hotel, we called the hotel and booked a car to pick us up at the airport.
We were graciously received, offered refreshments while checking in and promptly taken to our room.  While it is a little small, it is beautifully appointed and has a wonderful, private terrace.
Every detail in the hotel is well-considered and intimate in scale.  There are only 22 rooms and is of the quality you would expect with a Chateau and Relaix property.
The service is prompt, polite and wonderful in every way-- always eager to help.
We are eager to check out the restaurant, which is well-known and highly recommended.
This is a charming, well-run hotel that is warmly welcoming.  It is a great find.
We will stay here again.",5,2014,02,16
14,Made my stay in Barcelona Amazing,My husband and I just spent 3 nights at the hotel Neri in Barcelona. Located in the Bari Gottic which is the center of Barcelona’s old city.  It is the best location to stay at and close to everything you want to see and do in Barcelona. Like all the buildings in this area it is old and quaint but the rooms are nice and modern. The balcony in the room gives you amazing views of the old city.  It is really fun walking around the small streets near the hotel and trying out the different Tapas bars. The staff at the hotel was so friendly and helpful. Kudos to Yakovo for being so nice!,5,2014,02,14
14,A gem in the Gothic Quarter,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in January 2014. It's a beautiful little hotel and ideally located for getting around the sights of the Gothic area and beyond.
It's fairly awkward for taxi drivers to get right to the hotel but it's only a short walk from the square and the drivers will normally offer to take your luggage for you.
You get a warm welcome from the staff and are well looked after during your stay.
Rooms are very comfortable and, although we had to pay extra for our breakfast it was well worth it.
If you are looking for a boutique hotel in Barcelona the Hotel Neri will be very hard to beat.",5,2014,02,01
14,Wonderful Customer Service,"Although I had to unfortunately cancel my reservations for our stay, the customer service I received from Claudia in choosing  the ""perfect room""at this establishment was  exceptional!  I only hope we do get the opportunity to one day visit this little gem in the Gothic Quarters. ",5,2013,12,15
14,Nice place - but disappointing housekeeping,"Its all about the location!! Very conveniently hidden in the gems of the barri Gotik. Lovely bed/ room. BUT - shocking house keeping service. Drinking water not replaced, dressing gowns found on the bathroom floor, and had to request clean towels on 2 occasions as they were still wet from previous day. A bit of a shame considering the room rate and expected standard.",3,2013,12,02
14,Simply Excellent,"Arrived to be greeted by very friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us. We asked for restaurant recommendations, which they provided, booked and planned the route for us. Both recommendations were spot on and we experienced excellent local food at sensible (not cheap) prices.They also worked out that it was my wife's birthday (guessing from passport or cards in room, as we didn't mention it) and surprised us with a bottle of Cava.

The hotel is beautiful and positioned in an ideal location for exploring the Gothic quarter. We had a nice room (102) with a balcony overlooking the historical square. Don't get me wrong, this isn't absolute luxury, some minor improvements could be made but for the price it is the best I've experienced.

We would happily recommend The Neri, a lovely well thought out small hotel ideal for couples looking to enjoy a few days in Barcelona. The staff and location turned a great weekend into a perfect weekend!",5,2013,11,11
14,"Tiny gem of a hotel in Gothic Quarter, Barcelona","We visited Barcelona last for my second time last November and booked this hotel through mrandmrssmith.com. Hotel Neri is small, in a beautiful old building, well placed in a quiet side street in the Gothic Quarter, yet still close enough to bustle of Las Ramblas. The hotel is beautiful with a dramatic reception area, rooms and bathrooms. The restaurant and bar cosy but opulent, the food is gorgeous. If you do stay at this hotel do make your way to the food market nearby, a must have restaurant stop is Santa Caterina Cuines, quite amazing!",4,2013,11,11
14,Lovely small hotel in old section of Barcelona,"This was our second trip to Barcelona. We stayed at a large hotel the first time and wanted something smaller with charm that was near Las Ramblas on this trip. We found it at The Hotel Neri. We could walk everywhere! The hotel is very chic with a lovely restaurant. Our room was tasteful and comfortable with a terrace. Unfortunately the weather was not conducive to use it or the rooftop terrace that we had heard great things about. Next visit maybe and I hope there will be. I'd go in a heartbeat. Barcelona is a wonderful city with lots to see and do. For our two night stay, the Neri gave us quick access to the Barri Gothic section with its shops, outdoor restaurants
in charming plazas, narrow cobblestone streets with bakeries, bookshops, cathedrals and enjoyment in being a part of it.
This hotel is for the traveler who is interested in history, art/design and above average dining. I thought the quality was exceptional and certainly worth the price. Our last hotel was pricier but I
would prefer The Neri. It was just what we were looking for!",5,2013,11,05
14,"Opulent, Arty and Friendly Hotel","We booked a Junior suite (204) for four days to celebrate a special occasion.  The Hotel met all our expectations and I am surprised at some of the more critical reviews on this site.  The Hotel is small about 25 rooms and this adds to its charm.  It is comprised of two historic building tastefully converted into one Hotel.  The feel is modern and contemporary with a very high standard of interior decoration and styling.  Rooms and public areas have quality artworks and quality furnishings.
The Hotel is not in the nicest of streets, but the area is characterful and has some interesting boutique type shops.  It backs onto a particularly historic square bombed during the Civil War.  I note a previous reviewer makes mention of vagrants in the square at night; we did not find any and even if this were to be the case it would not be the fault of the Hotel.  Being in the Gothic area, means that the roads are narrow and winding and it is not easy to gain access with a vehicle.  If you plan to come from the airport, please ask the hotel to book you a taxi.  We arranged transfer by minibus shuttle which could not gain access to the Hotel and which dropped us in the Placa Jaume 1 which to be fair was just 3 minutes walk away.  The taxi we arranged through the hotel for our return transfer was no more expensive and left from the Hotel door.  The Hotel is actually very well positioned, close to the cathedral, Placa Nova and the Ramblas is about 10 minutes walk away.  The nearest Metro is 5 minutes walk.
Our Junior Suite was excellent, everything worked efficiently.  The bathroom was clad in what looked like iron pyrites stone which was unusual, and decadent.  The shower was efficient and powerful and there were no problems with obtaining hot water.  There was plenty of storage space, a safe, and good lighting options in the room.  For the fussy there is a choice of pillows duvet etc to cater for allergies etc.  There is a small minibar should you need it.
Staff at Reception were very helpful especially Claudia and Tim who offered us drinks on arrival and took time to register us, to equip us with a map of the area and to escort us to our rooms.  They were welcoming whenever we returned to the Hotel and offered reliable and good advice.  Staff at breakfast and in the restaurant were equally friendly and approachable.
Breakfast is served in a small room on the ground floor which also serves as a lounge and library during the day.  There is a small buffet, however each table is served a tray containing a selection of meats, cheese, preserves and pastries.  Hot dishes are available from a menu and the pancakes are worth trying – whatever cooked eggs or meats you select will be garnished with two slices of cooked potato and two slices of tomato, which is probably unnecessary.  Cake, Toast,  yoghurts, good coffee, a selection of teas and tisanes, juices and water are all available also.
We had the menu del dia at 22 Euros on our final day and enjoyed it – we had a very generous mushroom soup which was delicious followed by  iberico pork served with a fried potato sheet? And beetroot which was well thought out and well presented.  The portion size was quite small but it was a lunch dish.  The minted pear served for desert was also of high quality.  A large glass of wine of your choosing is provided in the cost.
The Hotel has a rooftop terrace, small but pleasant with plenty of greenery to watch the sunset. The first floor has a designer sofa which looks lovely but is probably a case of style over substance – nevertheless if assists the Hotel in its aspiration to be considered a sensual oasis.
Go.  It is a wonderful experience in an excellent city.",5,2013,11,02
14,Honeymoon at Neri,This hotel is beautiful. very old but updated to a contemporary style. I booked through a third party and that was a mistake. I sent the hotel an email to say we wanted a room with a balcony. I had already booked a suite but some did not have balconies. When we got there the rooms with balconies had been taken because they didn't have my name only a booking number. The manager helped and got us a room with a balcony. Very nice of him and we were very happy. One thing though is a suite at the Neri is very expensive and the suites without balconies were suites only because they had two chairs. Lot of money for only and additional two chairs in the room. Everything else was great. We didn't mind the school children playing in the courtyard behind the hotel.,4,2013,10,27
14,Very Nice Boutique Hotel in a Great Location,"This wasn't the easiest hotel to find but once we figured it out we were really glad we were just a few minutes away from the really busy (and noisy) areas in a more tranquil oasis.  We walked everywhere in the Gothic quarter from here and also up into the Eixample where we also have stayed,    Breakfast was very nice and included eggs/sausages etc as ordered.  Coffee was the pod espresso machine type and was fine.   The room was really very nice with a greta bathroom and lots of storage space.",5,2013,10,16
14,Pretty nice,"We have had a lovely time in this hotel, it was perfect for us. We have had a quite comfortable rooms with a nice terrace. The staff was very kind to us, they helped us a lot. The breakfast is very delicious, it was great. Absolutely recommended!",4,2013,10,16
14,Beautiful setting with a wonderful staff.,"The staff including Claudia and Tim were very friendly and helpful. Our room was quite comfortable with a lovely terrace. Very beautiful quiet street just steps from shopping, squares, and restaurants. The bathrooms lack storage space but the Hotel and excellent staff, not only at the Front desk, make up for that. We enjoyed the small breakfast and having wine on the 4th Floor Terrace at sunset. We highly recommend Hotel Neri.

14,Don't go there!,"I am fuming as I sit in my hotel room writing this review.  We book hotels on the basis of service and knowledge of good restaurants in the area and this hotel fails on all accounts.  The staff are not up to the standard expected of a hotel selling itself as being of high quality.  But having stayed ini several Relais & Chateau Hotels assuming incorrectly that the standard would be high this one is as disappointing as all of the others.  So my advice is to avoid any hotels with the Relais & Chateau label. As for location, not very nice view looking on to the little square which seems to be a home for vagrants.  They sleep under the tarpaulin of the cafe tables of this hotel.  Very sad.",1,2013,10,06
14,Great Authentic Experience of the Capital's Gothic Area,"As a first timer to Barcelona, it was paramount that I would leave after my visit, knowing that I have learnt some important history about the city, as well as having a great experience.

This Hotel was perfectly situated in the Gothic regions and it gave me more of a real ambience of the community. Known by many, and being situatiated just a few meters away from The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Barcelona and other establishments in the area; I learnt new things about the city just by roaming around and talking to the locals on a day to day basis. Apart from that, the staff here were very knowledgeable and had great conversations about events that took place in Barcelona's history, apart from being very helpful and friendly to us and others that I witnessed.

The unique blend between the morden interior and the 12th century building features and attributes was perfectly done, as it gave us that cousy feel that other hotels around did not offer.

 ",5,2013,10,03
14,Chic cool hotel in a fantastic location,"The Hotel Neri is a hidden gem nestled in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona just a stone's throw from the old cathedral. 
I stayed here on a 4 day city break to explore the delights of Barcelona.  I was due to be travelling with a friend but due to circumstances had to go on my own for the first two days so I was a little apprehensive! Well there was no need to be! The location of the Hotel is ideal for walking everywhere due to its central location.  The front desk couldn't have been more charming and helpful with great recommendations of places to eat. The hotel has a luxury cool boutique feel with simply but stylishly appointed rooms with fantastic bathrooms (no bath but huge showers). Air con in every room (boy do you need it in the height of summer). 
My room was overlooking a charming small square with a fountain. Initially I was put in a room on the front of the hotel when I arrived late at night and when I woke up in the morning and opened my curtains (luckily in my nightdress!) I found that the widows were less than 2 meters from the opposite houses and a man was sitting on his balcony looking straight in! Having said that, it is in the ancient Gothic Quarter so perhaps it is to be expected, I did ask to change rooms and they accommodated me with no fuss at all.
The whole vibe of the hotel is calm, cool, funky decor in a stunning old building but also very friendly.  Little touches such as the lemon water in the foyer are nice.
I ate breakfast there the first day which was good but expensive and after that just wandered to local cafes for a change.
I would definitely stay there again and recommend it.",5,2013,10,03
14,Expensive for what they offer,"Our room had a view of a wall of windows with their laundry hanging out. Not exactly scenic. We had expected better service for the price, and the additional cost of breakfast was high as well. They did not seem to have enough food - no yogurt, no American coffee, hard time understanding a boiled egg etc. From 10 A to 3 P, we had the make up the room sign on the door, but they did not get around to servicing the room. By the way, the hotel is impossible to find by taxi, as most are not allowed to drive down their narrow lane. That means jet lagged and confused, one has to drag your own bags for several blocks. The front desk tries hard, but they also dropped the ball of reservations requested. We had to go back and ask repeatedly.",3,2013,10,02
14,concierge training required,The hotel is in a great location and the room was very comfortable and quiet. Rooftop bar was a great place for pre/post dinner reflection with very helpful bartenders.  our real issue with the hotel was front desk/concierge service.  we sent the hotel concierge an e mail 2 weeks prior and asked for recommendations on lunch/dinner locations.  a response was provided with several choices------we confirmed the places/times/dates----and expected a confirming e mail to be sent by hotel after they were confirmed.  No response was ever provided.  the lady at check-in said she had sent the initial email but was not clear why she did not make the reservations and confirm.  we tried again that afternoon with the front desk---to make reservations----and the person said he would call and let us know.  No response---written or verbal---was ever provided.  we made our own choices from the Fodor's and had a great time----but would have expected more from this type of hotel.,4,2013,09,30
14,Not as good as expected...,"The hotel is very well located...in the Gothic Quarter. Some of the people at the front desk are very helpful...IE:Jacopo...others are not as professional as they should be...they tried, but, dropped the ball several times.
We arrived during the Festival of Our lady of Mercy...very late...and the young man who met us, really tried to circumvent the crowd and get us to the hotel..but, we walked for 15 min..this way and that, until finally we arrived. The other front desk guy, friendly and trying to help...looked up a shop for us and sent us on a wild goose chase, that never revealed the shop...a wasted day. If he had thought to call and be sure of the location, it would have been very helpful.
The first room...very high prices because of the festival..was very small and lacked light and anything in special amenities...they changed the room and we appreciated that. Except that in the evening, there was a smell, each night of a septic issue. We found turning off the airconditioning helped. This smell was also evident in the roof top bar. Apparently, the hotel is aware of this problem and have tried to fix it...however, as it was explained, it is an old building.
The breakfast was very good, the clientele, lovely, the attempt to help was genuine. However, I would look else where for a 4 star hotel...due to the lack of follow through from some of the front desk people and unfortunately, the odor. Not what one would expect from a Relais Chateaux hotel and prices to match.",3,2013,09,29
14,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here on friends recommendations.  Excellent location, staff very helpful, hotel spotless.  Not cheap, but we loved the decor and whole ambience of this small botique type hotel.  Would definitely recommend for a couple staying in barcelona for a few nights.",5,2013,09,28
14,Secluded AND beautiful in the center of Barri Gotique w/ ex-Adriá behinds the casseroles,"A perfect getaway if one wants calm and luxe. Volupte is just outside the walls, that seems anonymous if you don't stop by accident. The square outside where Gaudi's everyday chapel is located is beautifully simple. Also as elsewhere in the city, an emphasis on modern art/design. Super bed, room and toilet. The roof is absurdly quite location wise. Like a village, with plants, a bar, and quality jazz. I spent a day playing sax with the cd's up there, being asked to come back the next they by the bar. The tables in the, by night anyway, deserted little square outside, where the super restaurant serves food like consommé with piece of pig's face, dressed in gold, so it doesn't get humid by the liquid and stays crisp, with the taste if.. gold. Only minus was when I reserved a place for breakfast in the restaurant at arrival for the next day, and after a long night out, didn't use it, had to plea not to put it on the tab. ",5,2013,09,19
14,A True Delight!,"We loved our stay at Hotel Neri.  All of the staff that we interacted with, without exception, were friendly, pleasant, professional, and welcoming.  More than just checking us in or showing us to our room, they really embodied the meaning of hospitality.  

The hotel is located in the old part of town in Barri Gotic, so it's surrounded by delightful old alleys and buildings, and no cars. You can step out the front door and wander around sightseeing for hours.  The Mercado is very close by, as is the Cathedral, the Palace of Music, and much more - the location is great.  It's close to the Liceu metro stop too.  

And our room was great!  We had a balcony overlooking the courtyard and it was so much fun to watch and listen to the street life down below us.  The room was spotlessly clean and very stylish.   Don't miss the rooftop terrace either - try to snag a hammock if you can!  We loved Hotel Neri and will definitely stay there again next time we're in Barcelona.",5,2013,09,15
14,Charming small hotel & restaurant in the heart of thd gothic district,"This charming small hotel (22 rooms) oozes character & charm. Modern creative design marries beautifully with the old building & Sant Filip de Neri cobbled courtyard. Here in the historic courtyard delicious meals, snacks & drinks are served while you watch the comings & goings of tourist groups & others using it as a meeting place. Food is fresh & plentiful. Just don't be in a hurry at breakfast but it is well worth the wait. 

Thanks particularly to Mar at reception for her warm welcome & thoughtful accommodation of our luggage for a week. This hotel is full of character & perfectly situated for an exploration of the exciting Gothic area of Barcelona - an exploration that starts at The Neri. ",4,2013,09,15
14,Lovely spot to stay,"Recently stayed at the Hotel Neri and found it to be an excellent small hotel with a wonderful staff and lovely setting.  The hotel is located in the heart of the Barri Gothic area, close to many restaurants and other attractions in the city as well as public transport.  The hotel is small and well appointed and the rooms are very nice.  I would gladly stay here again if the chance arose.",5,2013,09,03
14,Wonderful Experience,"This hotel was a gem right in the middle of old Barcelona near an old church. It was SO clean. The bed felt so nice and refreshing, easy to get rid of jet lag in that bed, you could sleep for hours. There was lots of storage space and closet space to put your clothes, the TV was great, big and clear. The bathroom was spectacular, easily the best bathroom I have ever experienced in a hotel. The actual bathroom design itself is great, the stonework amazing. Their towels are fresh, as if you are the first person to ever use them. The toiletries are great, they have conditioner, soap, shampoo, shower gel, and body lotion. They also had a full length mirror in the bathroom along with a shower/tub. 
The service was spectacular. They were so kind about everything, called us taxis, made reservations everywhere from the fish pedicure place to the most amazing restaurants. They were so helpful in finding everything, giving detailed directions and being patient with our confusion of the city's layout. Anything they didn't know the answer to, which wasn't much, they quickly found the answer. They were great, had turn down service, room service, a great mini bar stocked with everything from candy to champagne.
Perhaps my favorite place in this hotel though, was the great rooftop bar. It was a great place to sit and plan out my night with my family. The view was very cool and the ambiance, amazing.",5,2013,08,15
14,Disappointingly underwhelmed,"We were very excited upon our arrival at this beautiful, unique, historical enclave of peace in the very congested Gothic Quarter of Barcelona.  Our room was spacious and well appointed with a peaceful, inviting terrace.  We spent a little time unpacking and getting settled into Room 303 before setting out for the day.  When we returned in the evening, we opened the door to our deluxe room and were greeted by a horrible aroma.  The front desk told us about the incense in the room and offered to bring us additional.  Unfortunately, incense burns out rather quickly and all night we were awakened by this unpleasant smell.  In the morning they apologized and had us switched to a new room without any offer of renumeration.  They obviously knew about this problem and we feel it was dishonest to put us in there in the first place.  The experience left us with a bad taste and, obviously, smell.",3,2013,08,08
14,Lovely Hotel and holiday,"We stayed for 4 nights in July 2013 and couldn't of asked for more. For a standard room, it was beyond expectations with a beautiful view of the courtyard at the back of the hotel. The bathroom was perfect, with lots of toiletries and different settings for the lights. The staff were friendly and very helpful, happy to recommend places to eat and how best to get to certain sights etc. The hotel has a lovely feel to it, very luxurious and the roof top terrace is a gorgeous addition. We loved every minute of our stay here and would recommend it and even stay here again if we return one day. The location is perfect, not far to walk to the square where the bus from the airport drops you off or where you pick up the red hop-on/off buses. The tourist information is only a few minutes walk away as is the cathedral - and the shops, cafes and ice cream parlours down the cobbled streets are much nicer than the busier La Rambla. We found the hotel very quiet with the windows shut and temp control on which allowed us to have a very comfortable stay when the outside temperature was reaching 38 degrees :) Overall, we're so pleased we paid that bit extra - it's well worth it!",5,2013,08,01
14,Just wonderful,"We stayed at the Hotel Neri for 6 nights, in a deluxe room, 2nd floor. The design of the hotel is marvellous, a wonderful combination of old materials into a modern and tasteful design in a charming old house. A brief collection of statements: the room was spacy and very quiet at night; the design of the bathroom was outstanding - we have never seen such beautiful natural granite tiles, which they used for the walls; relaxing atmosphere; the staff was authentically friendly; the breakfast was superb; the location in the Gothic quarter is perfect. There have been tiny things which we suggested for improvement, and they were taken care of instantly.",5,2013,07,26
14,Very pleasant,"Just returned from three days at the neri.
Great location, on a very small square, picture perfect, with the most comfortable beds I have slept in for a long time. They really have done a great job converting the space, keeping it light and airy.
The only slight downside was the service, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't as 'smiley' as the hotel we had transferred from, it seemed a little aloof.  Great recommendation for tapas given by the concierge  though, 'bar del pla', wow, you must go!",4,2013,07,12
14,Quaint Bar,"We were with a large group (most staying at the W Hotel and some at the Neri). We had late night cocktails (lots of them) at the bar and the bar attendants were more than accommodating to all our needs (even after they ""officially"" closed). Can't say enough about the tall bartender...sorry I forget his name.",4,2013,07,12
14,Could be the best hotel in Barcelona if they improve their customer service.,"Neri is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful location.  The room is gorgeous.  The service can be excellent when they want to be.  Miguel was super helpful at the front desk.  When they don't want to be helpful it's like they go out of their way not to help.  For example - we were going to the Barcelona Cathedral which is steps from their door and yet they could not tell me whether shorts were allowed.  I had to go back to let them know shorts weren't and I changed and resumed our touring.  This is a MAJOR tourist destination in the city.  Did they really not know or not care?  Additionally, I sent laundry to be washed.  There was no receipt in the bag.  We marked ""wash and fold, no iron"" on the bag.  The bag had three yoga t-shirt material cover ups, 2 t-shirts, three undergarments, a hat, summer jersey dress, and a pair of linen pants.  When the clothing was delivered the following day they called the cover ups ""jackets"" 8 euros (12 dollars) a piece, the t-shirts ""blouses"", 6.80 euros each.  Etc. the total bill was 103 euros (150$).  The thing is I would've been FINE paying that $ if that is indeed what we dropped off- but it wasn't! Everything was marked up.  When I confronted the front desk- they said my husband filled out the paper (he did not- there was no paper).  When I told the front desk he basically said I was lying and that he did.  Totally not appreciated.  Additionally, the room is VERY dark as well as the bathroom.  If you're looking to put makeup on, expect it to be very light or as heavy as a drag queen because you Can't tell at all.  But the room in total is gorgeous so it makes up for it.  The rooftop is probably the best thing about this place overlooking the city and there was a very friendly bartender up top who welcomed us in.  In short, great location, beautiful place, if they added better customer service this would be my #1 hotel in Barcelona.",3,2013,07,11
14,Best hotel of a three week trip,"A great location in the gothic quarter, very well located for walking around without being in the one of the noisier night spots.  This is a small hotel with a helpful and friendly staff.  Room was directly opposite a private apartment building but not a concern and bed was large and comfortable (as was the room and bathroom).  Didn't eat breakfast or meals in the restaurant, tried the rooftop bar which was OK, but returned a couple of times for wine or coffee at the tables outside on the Plaza de Felipe San Neri.",5,2013,07,10
14,Super Chic Hotel in Great Location,"Delightful gem of a boutique hotel that opens onto the Plaza de San Felipe Neri.  Our room on the second floor had a lovely balcony view of the Plaza opposite and the church of San Felipe Neri (a parish church that was open for mass but closed otherwise).   Art installations throughout the beautiful hotel, which provides easy access to the Cathedral, Las Ramblas, and the Gothic Quarter.  Staff was helpful and efficient.  Breakfasts were okay, not much more than that, but didn't detract from our enjoyment of the hotel.",4,2013,07,09
14,Beautiful hotel on the heart of barri Gotic,"This hotel is located on the heart of barri Gotic, with terrace on the plaça Neri historical and beautiful peaceful square,great location.
The rooms are good size and well decorated modern stile with little terrace,the service was fantastic friendly and helpful,
Fantastic healthy breakfast selection.",5,2013,07,07
14,Mixed bag in restaurant,"Stopped by the interesting properrty for lunch and as per previous reviews it was a mixed bag. We were seated in the restaunrant and the menu was a choice of 2 items, one a 5 course menu and the other a rather forgettable choice. We asked if that had some smaller appetizers and they brought the menu from the bar. Some of us wanted the full menu others just a light snack from the bar menu. Once we commmunicated this we were told the bar menu was not availbale in the restaurant so we would have to move to he bar. OK.

We moved the 12' into the bar (basicallly the same room) and then ordered from both menus - there were 2 other tables in the restaurant that were occupied - silly to move us, pretentious actually. We then ordered and had some drinks. Through all this the staff were the most dourer bunch I have layed eyes on - not a smile and barely eye contact.

The food arrived - generally good but small portioned, had to chase the waiter and request, napkins, silverware and drink refills. All in all underwhelming.",4,2013,06,26
14,Fantastic romantic break,"We stayed in a suite (106). Absolutely beautiful hotel with unusual art installations. The suite was a very good size. The hotel is in a narrow side street very near La Catedral and within easy reach of Las Ramblas, La Catedral and the port. As it's in a side street, the windows are directly opposite private apartment buildings but this was not a major concern. The room was luxurious, loved the bathroom and the furniture. Good service all round, especially room service. Would love to return soon.",5,2013,06,16
14,Heart of Barcelona,"Stepping out of this boutique hotel into the narrow streets of the Gothic quarter is a wonderful experience and feeling. The hotel staff were so friendly, helpful and professional and the room was spacious and clean and the bathrooms was great with a proper shower with a stone floor that was much appreciated after a day of walking around La Rambla and the various cathedrals. The breakfast was plentiful, but similar every day  and by the third day was looking and tasting a bit stale. For the price you pay, I expected a bit better, but it didn't detract greatly from our overall experience.",4,2013,06,07
14,Relais & Chateaux Need to Rethink This One: It's more B&B than Hotel,"This is an unpleasant review to write because the staff at the hotel were so nice. But this is really not a very good hotel.

It is also difficult to write because the downstairs rooms are exquisitely decorated and very attractive. But most of us stay in hotels in part because of the rooms, and Hotel Neri is really not a  high grade hotel.

We had a so-called ""junior suite"" on the street side, with a ""so-called"" outdoor terrace. The room was disconcertingly small, barely room for one suitcase open and with two small and uncomfortable chairs. The floor is hardwood with no rugs, so unpleasant to walk on without shoes. Because the glass doors open to a terrace surrounded by a cheap, dreary looking and fairly high bamboo fence, so you feel enclosed even with the outdoor space that would normally add to one's sense of space. There were just two cheap canvas chairs on the fairly large terrace, so it was cold, ugly (unattractive deck flooring) and we never wanted to be out there.

The bathroom is very very small: we didn't have room for toiletries for two; the shower is poorly designed -- you have to be in it to work the controls, so you get the cold water on you before the hot sets in. A truly bad bathroom that is not salvaged by the handsome granite walls that, if anything, add to the sense of claustrophobia because they are a dark gray and there is almost no natural light coming in.

Though the dining room downstairs is handsome and elegant, in May we wanted to have breakfast outdoors, but they only place chairs and tables outside on weekends. The breakfast will set you back nearly $85 for two, absurdly expensive, particularly when you can't enjoy the courtyard outside because you're confined to the dining room.

Handsomely decorated as the lobby may be, there really isn't much space to sit: the ""library"" is just a small sitting room and if people are on the single large couch, there's scant room for anyone else and its so small there's no privacy for a conversation.

Others have written about the noise from barking dogs in the narrow medieval streets outside, and though we were spared weekend drunks and revelers, it was clear that this is not a peaceful place for someone one jetlag needing a nap, let alone sleep.

The rooftop sitting and bar area was very cheaply done: once again, the unattractive bamboo surround was confining, the furniture uncomfortable, and there was rarely anyone accessible for a drink.

On the good side, the location is excellent, though the shops and restaurants nearby aren't too interesting. For breakfasts though the interesting Boqueria market is very close by so that was a plus.

We had a bad incident on departure that was both distressing and also exemplified what seemed to be the disorganized manner in which the place is operated. We have traveled in the US over 200 times and abroad more than 90 times in over three decades, to over 45 countries, to hotels large and small in both third world and European and Asian capitals. The night before our departure we asked the front desk to have a cab ready in the morning, which they did. We packed out bags and had them ready for pickup in the room. When we came downstairs the taxi was at the door, and we told the front desk we would have coffee in the dining room before leaving. When we came out the front desk staff was there, courteously and promptly handled our checkout, and we left.

But.

When we got to the airport and the driver gave us our hand luggage, he was about to drive away when we asked him to unload out suitcases. There weren't any. The hotel staff had forgotten to retrieve our bags from our room. We immediately called the hotel and urged them to place out suitcases in a taxi ASAP to meet us at the airport. I advised that I thought the hotel should handle the cost of the taxi. Fortunately, it arrived in time with our suitcases to catch our flight, but the hotel hadn't paid the taxi, so we absorbed the cost.

In short, the hotel is a handsome building in an interesting location with a very nice and courteous staff, but it really doesn't even have basic services. Also, whatever was spend in the renovation of the downstairs area seems to exhaust the budget, because the hallways upstairs and the rooms are spartan and cheaply, is tastefully done. To have a suite with an outdoors terrace and to never want to even have a drink or coffee on the terrace is a very unpleasant experience for over $500 a night.",2,2013,06,06
14,Excellent Choice!!,"One of the best hotels I've ever visited in thirty years of traveling!! Excellent location, beautiful decor, perhaps the most friendly staff anywhere. Booked three suites #201-#302 & 303 for 7 nights May 21--- May 29 and loved being there !!  The entrance was gorgeous and most people passing by would stop and admire the view through the full glass doors. The breakfast was worth the price contrary to what I had read. A typical European breakfast complimented by your personal choice from the kitchen. Eggs, french toast or pancakes ( Spanish style ) local sausage and much more. Rooms 302 and 201 looked out to the famous courtyard upon St Neri Chapel the same chapel Guadi visited every night after work. This very chapel was His destination the night He was accidentally killed. Also of note, this court yard was the location of the music video "" My Immortal"" by Evanescence. You Tube the song to get a nice sense of the court yard and see the bomb damage evident on the walls from the civil war in the 1930's. The street Sant Sever was the street 13 year old Saint Eulalia was persecuted on by the Romans . Her memorial is fifty feet from the front door of the hotel if you turn right when exiting. Visit the cloister when open and enter the cathedral this way. Note the 13 white ducks in honor of St. Eulalia.  Also found the streets and area safe and easy to find our way around returning most nights well past midnight. Sant Juame plaza is a 2 minute walk and one can find a taxi all hours or use this location for a return location, every taxi driver knows this plaza. The old cathedral is a great landmark for finding your way. Sant Clara deli is two blocks great take out sandwiches and bakery products. Lastly one can walk to the beach in about 20 minutes !! how great is that?
PS arriving 4 hours before the 2 pm check in, we were given our rooms.

14,Fantastic hotel,"Visited the hotel for a 3 days break in MAY 2013

We had booked a car to pick us up at the airport through the hotel. And I was quite pleased with that as the hotel is not easy to find ;o) He parked closed by and we walked for 2 minutes.
The welcomming in the hotel is nice and easy and you have a short tour around the hotel. As we had not booked breakfast they offered us the breakfast menu at a good price.

We had booked a Junior Suite with a lovely taresse. Room 305 (I think ;o) The room as at the top floor. There is no view from the room as the streets in the area is so close by but the terasse was quite privat any way.
There was absolutely NO noice in the room. Best sleep ever in a big city. And the beds are ok.
The room had a nice size and everyhting that we needed was there. Ask for more hangers. 

I loved the privacy of the hotel! Not to many rooms and it is very quites anfd everybody is very welcomming.

Breakfast was very nice.

The language level of the staff is really good.

I can only recomment this place and would love to go back.",5,2013,05,23
14,Fan-tas-tic!!,"I stayed at the Hotel Neri on the 06th of May for one night. I was in room 302. It is difficult to describe how fantastic this hotel is. I loved the location, right in the middle of the old town, in a very narrow street. I just loved the lobby, unlighted by the natural and soft sunlight coming from the high ceiling which is a large window. I just loved the architecture, as this hotel used to be a convent. I loved the room, furnished with style, perfectly combining warm colors with flashy ones. The bathroom was just amazing, the bathtub walls are made of granite.. In few words I could stay here hours speaking about the Hotel Neri and the fantastic stay I experienced there, about the breakfast, the personnel etc... Everything was perfect. I wish more hotels could be of that level. If you are looking for an unforgettable stay in a cosy boutique and unique hotel in Barcelona, you now know where you should stay. ",5,2013,05,17
14,"Beautiful, Quiet Respite.","This gorgeous hotel in nestled right into one of the tiny streets in the Gothic Quarter.  I loved the large glass doors that welcomed you and the roof top terrace was a great escape after a day of walking the streets of Barcelona.  The front desk staff was amazing.  We loved the rain shower in our bathroom and the tiny balconies off our room...great for people watching!  Also a nice plus, they put the next day's weather forecast on our pillow each night.",5,2013,05,14
14,Very cool hotel right in the old Barri Gotic Barcelona,"this is a very funky and cool hotel with a special ambience.  Loved it.  Located right inside the Barri Gotic on one of the tiny lanes, about 100 yards walk from Placa de Sant Jaume, and just minutes from many restaurants and shopping.  Fabulous architecture and cool modern design built into the ancient walls of the old building.  Excellent restaurant that served wonderful Spanish breakfasts of croissants, Iberian ham and cheeses, but augmented by your choice of omelettes or egg dishes (all included in our package).  Dinner was a delight as well - have to try the gourmet fixed course menu at least once.  Two items you must know though: 1) We were in room 107, a lovely junior suite with 20 foot ceilings and lush décor, however, because it is right in the old quarter, when you open your windows, you are looking right into an apartment 6 feet away!  Hence you appreciate the velvet curtains!  If you are a light sleeper, you may wish to choose a higher floor to minimize some of the street noise that is inevitable.   2) I agree with other reviews regarding a concierge service - the staff tries so hard to be helpful, but if you are waiting to check out, it can be a little annoying waiting for someone planning a tour or dining experience.  High marks to the staff though, they did everything to make us feel very welcome and comfortable.  Can't wait to return, such a cool funky place.",4,2013,05,08
14,Best hotel experience ever,"Simply the best hotel experience we've ever had. Of all the wonderful things that could be said - tranquile location but as central as it gets, relaxing atmosphere, helpful and friendly staff, elegant design, great roof-top terrace and a huge etc - the bathroom stands out as exceptional. The best four nights sleep I can remember. A hotel you could easily get addicted to.",5,2013,05,08
14,WONDERFUL,"Been to Barcelona three times now all at 4 star hotels and decided to stay at the Neri this year, What a choice! Fantastic.

As was my birthday we booked a junior suite and wasn't dissappointed, loved everything about the room, huge comfy bed and a bathroom to die for, enjoyed the private outdoor space as being a smoker it was great to just slip on the provided bathrobe and nip outside without having to get dressed and stand in the street!

Suite 303 - was very quiet and I heard no noise at all,

When we arrived we were shown the public lounge/reading room with complimentary lemonade!
Attentive staff, made me feel very comfortable and at home,

Had coffee and cake in the bar and just sat for over an hour without feeling the need to leave, so relaxing.

Location is spot to discover the old town

Wont be staying anywhere else",5,2013,05,06
14,Beautiful Hotel in excellent location,"An excellent location in the Gothic Quarter this is an absolutely beautiful hotel . The staff were very friendly and helpful , nothing was too much trouble . The rooms are very comfortable , clean and well appointed .",5,2013,05,05
14,Awesome Hotel and Location,"As a family of four including two teenagers, we knew that we wanted to stay in the Gothic Quarter.  We absolutely loved Hotel Neri for its cool historic style, location, staff and oudoor patio bar which is in a small enclosed town square (with its own amazing history).  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  My husband and I really ejoyed ending our nights with a glass of wine on the patio.  Our private tour guide told us that Hotel Neri is genuinely her favorite hotel in the city.  We hope to return to Barcelona soon and will stay here again!",5,2013,05,04
14,Perfection!,"Intimate, perfectly situated, delightful in every way.  The staff:  brilliant and accommodating.  Our room overlooking Plaça San Felip Neri, unforgettable.  Facilities delightful, esp. the terrace bar et al.  YES.",5,2013,05,02
14,Best hotel stay in Barcelona!,"Hotel Neri was just about the nicest hotel in which we've ever stayed!  Very upscale - the bathrooms were granite walled and perfectly clean and well appointed - and comfortable!  It is located smack in the Gothic quarter, easy walk to all sights. Safe, attractive, comfortable beds (I know, in Europe?  I'm not kidding), and the restaurant was great, too!  I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.",5,2013,04,30
14,The best in Barcelona,This hotel was everything it shares with you on the internet and more.  We had a lovely appointed room with a comfortable bed and bathroom.  The view from our window was facing the cathedral which was beautiful.  The staff was excellent.  Mar at the front desk is the best and would do anything to help make your stay a memorable one.  This fabulous hotel is within walking distance to practically everything in beautiful Barcelona.  My daughters had a wonderful room also.  Plenty of room and nice amenities.  We will be back to this great place....soon!,5,2013,04,10
14,"Perfect, Perfect, Perfect","It would be impossible to express just how perfect our stay this hotel was! From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.  But even before our arrival in Barcelona the hotel helped with arranging transfers and providing information on activities.  They were always helpful, even when there was a mulfunction with the hotel room safe.  We stayed in the Junior Suite which is beautiful, and we enjoyed everything the room had to offer including a CD and DVD menu.  The decorations are modern and beautiful and the hotel itself felt like escaping into luxury.  The location is also close to the metro for getting to attractions a little further away.  Do take the time out though to take a stroll to the beach which is more than possible from this location.  the overall expereince was great and small niggles like a buzzing bedside light didnt even seem worthy of a complaint, although I am sure the efficient a´nd helpful staff would have sorted it out immediately.",5,2013,04,08
14,Perfect in Barcelona,"I couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay in Barcelona. Great location, friendly staff, clean, very ""spa"" like. Right near the very historic cathedral and beautiful gothic area. 
Loved it!

      ",5,2013,04,01
14,Hidden Gem in the heart of old Barcelona,"We stayed here during a recent trip to Barcelona for our wedding Anniversary.  The hotel is beautiful, serene and is walking distance to all key areas of old Barcelona.  The daily breakfasts were outstanding, and their service impeccable!",5,2013,04,01
14,"Lovely, but...","I went to Barcelona for a quick get away from cold London & was really looking forward to staying at this Relais boutique property. I found the place very charming and lovely. I do have to say that it would greatly benefit from having a specific hotel concierge. Currently the front desk does it all and they messed up a dinner reservation at a local place (turns out the restaurant was closed when we got there). Also when I was checking out I had to wait over 20 minutes for a couple who were checking in to decide on where they wanted to go for dinner & taking up the time of the front desk clerk. The hotel staff was very friendly and our room was nice (I particularly loved the bathroom). My only complaint about the room was that our double pane window didn't have a handle & didn't completely shut; with all the tourist & late night drunks in those tiny streets- it wasn't the most pleasant sleep. The hotel sent someone to try & fix but couldn't, so we just got a ""sorry"". For the price I expected a bit more, but it was ok for a quick trip. It's in a great location & overall a lovely place.",3,2013,03,12
14,Small hotel incredible service,"Small, hidden, luxurious, charmful, quiet, good service, perfect location, great selection of toiletries, excelentroom service. We entered a 4 star hotel but we never figured so, the hotel could be a five star hotel without any doubts.",5,2013,03,11
14,Great Boutique Hotel,"I have waited for quite some time to comment on this hotel and it's always come back to haunt me. Like many of the other reviewers, great location, very nice accommodations, intimate hotel. I don't recall the restaurant being anything special but the only thing I might add is we had a room on the courtyard side which did get some weekend noise. Otherwise, it was an outstanding hotel and staff.",4,2013,02,25
14,Barcelona Boutique Hotel,"Designers heaven at this boutique hotel.  Fun and funky collides with old world charm.  There was much to love about this hotel, the design ,great location and helpful daytime staff. Good sized rooms and large modern bathrooms. We had an problem with noise from plant operating the kitchen equipment and after several phone calls after midnight to reception we were moved to a quieter room. Day time staff arranged for late check out to make up for noise.",4,2013,01,28
14,very nice & romantic hotel,very nice & romantic hotel. and the location is very central. the restaurant is also very nice and cosy. the rooftop terraza is very romantic and nice place to have a glass of wine or cocktail. the area around the hotel is also very nice. so a good choice for a hotel,5,2013,01,13
14,Location location,"Loved this hotel. Stayed 2 nights in January. We had 4 rooms including deluxe room and junior suite. All were gorgeous especially room 107 with its high wooden ceilings. Beautiful stone bathrooms, comfortable beds, nice bar. Charming and helpful receptionist. We loved the small boutique feel and real barrio gothic atmosphere. Location exceptional in the heart of the barrio gothic, cathedral, shops etc. Don't come here if you are looking for the modern 5 star hotel experience, do come if you want the real Barcelona. You are about a metre away from the neighbours washing lines and mornings were not partcularly quiet with schoolchildren and church bells! Have previously stayed at the hotel grand central hotel in summer time which is a good summer choice because of the rod top bar and pool. Neri is a great winter choice and we will be back.",5,2013,01,10
14,The Essence of Barcelona,"Hotel Neri is a delicious boutique hotel with its own proper style made of antique feel, proper quaint and fascinating atmosphere and late design items balancing a flavoured taste as the perfect essence of this extraordinary city. Location is perfect, right in the Barrio Gotico not far from cathedral. Staff is top level as the hotel restaurant. Price is not really affordable to anyone this is anyway still a good bargain for what you get. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2012,12,26
14,"Fabulous location, luxury hotel","Stayed here for a weekend in July for our first visit to Barcelona and we were not disappointed! Being in the Gothic quarter means you are perfectly located for soaking up the atmosphere, and exploring the narrow streets, bars and restaurants on foot. The staff were lovely, our room was huge and very comfortable, and the food at the restaurant was delicious. We had aperitifs on the roof top terrace, and sat outside in the courtyard for our meal on Saturday night.  There's a unique little jewellry shop next door too...",5,2012,12,19
14,A weekend in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona,"Some steps away of the cathedral and located at the Neri place it is a unique option to live the in the heart of Barcelona walking trough the naroow streets of the former jewesh quarter.
the hotel has a nice terrasse ""Roba Estessa"", a bar a restaurant and very confortable rooms, where you can arrange a massage. very nice people give your stay very pleasant. you can also enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of the Neri place.",5,2012,12,03
14,Perfect hotel !!!,Hotel Neri is a perfect small hotel perfectly situated in the historic heart of the Bari Gothic.  Finding the hotel takes two minutes.  The area is perfectly safe and wondering thru the small streets with all the shops and restaurants is what makes Barcelona such a wonderful city.  The hotel it's staff and the location guarantees that your vacation in Barcelona will be favorite memory for years.,5,2012,12,01
14,Recommended without hesitation,"Our stay at Hotel Neri added to the entire Barcelona experience. Location could not be better and staff could not be more helpful. The artwork and rooftop were romantic. The scented candlelight in the evening added to the magic. If there might be noise during night hours in the small plaza, it is due to music and laughter--in itself an appreciation of life in Barcelona. The hotel is small, quaint, elegant yet cozy.",5,2012,11,12
14,Great location and hotel,"The hotel is situated almost next door to the Cathedral so getting to it by car is not possible.  The location is good within walking distance to several attractions, near the underground.
Rooms themselves are beautiful, spacious, clean and modern.  Staff are very friendly, speak wonderful English and cannot be praised enough.  The bar offers snacks and drinks at standard Barcelona prices.  Breakfast and meals in the restaurant were so expensive I did not bother.  The only criticism is the soundproofing hence my tip.  I would stay there again just in another room",4,2012,11,10
14,Loved this hotel after 6 nights there,This small hotel was outstanding.  It is in the old but quiet part of the city within walking distance of key places we wanted to see.  Perfect location.  Loved walking the medieval streets.  We had a small suite.  It was expensive but worth the price. Food was over the top.  Staff helpful and attentive.,5,2012,11,09
14,Excellent boutique hotel,"This hotel is an ideal, central location to have all the Barcelona attractions on your doorstep. Tucked away in the Gothic quarter this small hotel amenities for a city break with a touch of luxury. Rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet (despite central location). Contemporary decor with a hint of individual style. Luxurious walk in shower with a large array of toiletries. Lovely roof top bar, complete with hammocks just perfect for evening drinks.  Very attentive staff making our stay perfect for sight seeing before venturing up the coast for the beach. Would definitely return, there is still so much more to see and do in this fabulous, friendly city.",5,2012,10,29
14,Our stay at Hotel Neri,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Neri in October, 2012.  It's a beautiful hotel and the location is exceptional.  It's on a very quiet, narrow cobble stone street used by pedestrians, not cars.  It's close to all the best sights in the older part of the city of Barcelona.  My one disappointment was  our standard room.  If you don't mind spending $400 euros for a very small room in a lovely boutique hotel, then it is the place for you.  We don't usually spend that much on a room when traveling, but decided to splurge and so were expecting more for the money.  From what I could see while out exploring, there are plenty of other very good options nearby for a lot less.  We spent about two weeks traveling through Spain and stayed at some lovely, intimate, charming hotels.  Unfortunately, Hotel Neri is lovely, but doesn't have an intimate, charming feel.",3,2012,10,28
14,Nice but...,"I have high expectation when I choose a Relais et Chateaux especially one as expensive.The hotel itself is beautiful, old stones and great designs. The rooms were really tiny, the bathroom just had a shower but with great amenities, amazing sheets and bedding.The breakfast not included was good but very expensive especially I had to ask for a new fresh orange juice as the one brought to our room was really NOT fresh!! Then there seem to never be enough staff at the entrance lobby, nice service but u had to wait for ever if u had to ask a question because the receptioniste seemed to have to do it all by herself.
Overall not impressed by this hotel and will probably look for an other hotel in Barcelona next time. ",3,2012,10,19
14,Boutique gem in great location,"We stayed in a Junior Suite for 3 nights before a cruise and were delighted with this charming boutique hotel. We had a balcony, which was directly across from an apartment building, yet it was private and quiet due to bamboo screens (and it even had a hammock). We used the hotel's private driver pickup from the airport, Armando, who gave us information about the sights during the ride and took us directly to the hotel's door. When we left, the cab that was called for us came just a few feet from the door. The hotel is located in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, and a short walk to Las Ramblas and Metro stations. The Lounge Bar has seating in the Plaza Sant Felip Neri, which was a lovely, quiet and historic location to have a cocktail and snack in the evening. Our room was large, considering most European standards, and soothing, spa-like. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2012,10,17
14,Gem in the Gothic,"Agree with most other recent reviews.  Quaint, boutique hotel in excellent location.  Easy walk to Ramblas, Born or Eixample.  Service friendly; room quiet.  Yes, slightly hard to find, but that adds to the old world charm.  Yes again, breakfast is expensive - so get out of bed and walk 5 minutes to the Pinotxa bar at La Boqueria- you won't regret it!!!  There are limitations to a structure built 1000 years ago - this hotel overcomes them as well as any in Europe.  Fantastique!!!!!!!  Book us again anytime!!!!!",5,2012,10,09
14,Pleasant surprise,Our first challenge was finding this hotel. We had a little bit of difficulty after being left in a plaza a few small streets away by our cab from the airport.  I suggest you print a good map of the area to help you as the cabs are not able to take you to the door.  Once at the hotel it was a pleasant surprise.  Beautiful is a word that comes to mind.  The hotel is beautiful and gorgeously decorated.  The rooms are small but this seems to fit the style of the area where the hotel is located.  The rooms come with all necessary to enjoy your holiday.,4,2012,10,05
14,Hotel Neri in Barcelona a nice quiet gem,"Tucked away in a quiet corner of the old neighborhood, Hotel Neri is close enough to all of the attractions Barcelona has to offer without making you feel like you are stuck in the middle of all of the loud tourists. The rooms are well-appointed, clean, soothing, even spacious (esp. by European standards). The price is not unreasonable for what you get.  Recommend booking ear,y as it is small and availability is limited. Be aware that you are charged up front and there is precious little flexibility in changing dates. Another negative is the breakfast: don't. Even. Go. There.",4,2012,10,02
14,Nearly perfect place to stay,"The Hotel Neri while not cheap was nearly the perfect romantic getaway for my wife and I.  The restaurant staff and chef were amazing.  The hotel staff was very very good.  The hotel itself was incredible.  The only slightly negative aspect to the hotel was our room overlooking the Sant Philip Neri square.  Lots of activity at all hours of the day and night so was slightly noisy.  The excellent construction of the remodeled hotel kept most of the noise away.  The location of the hotel was perfect, could not have been better.  I highly recommend the Neri and it's staff.",5,2012,10,01
14,Neri Good,A wonderful little boutique hotel in the heart of the Gothic quarter.The service was first class with a warm welcome and helpfulness along the way. Did not eat in the restaurant for dinner as had found the breakfast disappointing - not bad just over priced. Both bars offer a warm and welcome escape from the heat and hassle of the city. Would return!,4,2012,09,29
14,Found a Jewel!,"Beautiful, clean jewel in the Gothic quarter. After a long trip we were warmly greeted by this spectacular Hotel. Old world charm but comfortable modern facilities. Has a great restaurant and a fun roof top bar. Our room overlooked a quaint courtyard. Would definitly book tis place on a return trip.",5,2012,09,27
14,Boutique hotel in the midst of the Gothic Quarter,"This gem is in the Gothic Quarter about a block from The Cathedral down a narrow cobblestoned walkway.  It has old world charm with all the modern conveniences and has a knowledgeable staff always present to help.  Outside the restaurant of this inn is an enchanting square with a small fountain - a great place to linger.  (I don't recommend the breakfast fare.)  The rooms are clean, quiet, modern and the bed comfortable.  This is where I want to stay if I return to Barcelona.",5,2012,09,25
14,My 1st choice when/if I return to BCN,"I read some of the ""terrible"" reviews, to see what anyone could possibly complain about. They seemed pretty weak. In the middle of La Merce, the surrounding area gets pretty packed, and loud if you are an early to bed kinda person, but the location was fantastic.  
Right in the middle of the La Merce action, and a ridiculously short walk everywhere you would want to go.  The old style of the facade and the modern amenities of the inside were exactly what we were looking for
Breakfast isn't cheap, no, but that's hardly a reason to knock the hotel itself, and you get some incredible food for the Euros.
Also, we certainly didnt have the experience some of the poor reviews complained of, with the staff.  They helped with everything we needed, and even understood my poor attempts at Spanish.
This place set the mood for a fantastic weekend, and lived up to and beyond our expectations",5,2012,09,25
14,Beautiful boutique hotel,"This is a lovely hotel located in the gothic quarter.  Wonderful old world atmosphere and great location to walk to other sights throughout the city.  The reception staff was very friendly and helpful.  We especially enjoyed having a nightcap on the rooftop terrace and in the Placa de Sant Felip Neri.  Did not eat here, but there are wonderful small restaurants and tapas bars nearby.",5,2012,09,25
14,READY TO GO BACK,"My husband and I stayed at the Neri last year and we're about to reserve a room for this fall. The location can't be beat and the staff is extra helpful. The architecture is a fascinating mix of ancient and modern. 

I have two minor complaints. 
1) Our room was small, but that was a small sacrifice overall.
2) The restaurant is expensive, but you certainly don't have to eat there. Try one of the many small places in the neighborhood instead. We had churros and hot chocolate for breakfast at a coffee shop on the other side of the cathedral. The churros were fresh and delicious, and the hot chocolate was a piece of thick, bitter-sweet heaven.",4,2012,08,29
14,Pros and cons,"Pros- great location, walking distance to many places, clean, good breakfast, helpful and nice  staff, I would stay here again, and I'm picky! :)

Cons- breakfast is expensive (25 euros person,unless u want toast), standard room was small (but I kinda expected it since the area), very little counter space in bathroom, shower water would stpray from shower head out of the top of the shower and get the entire bathroom wet, we asked them to fix it but it still did the same thing, free wi fi is set up so it disconnects if there is no action within a few min, no gym or spa

Overall this is a super nice hotel. Probably the nicest in the gothic quarter. I would def stay here agai.",4,2012,08,28
14,Stunning,We have returned having recently spent 3 nights at the hotel.  A beautiful well designed boutique hotel which made our visit to Barcelona that bit more special.  Our room with a terrace was very well appointed and the attention to detail was superb.  A special mention has to be the staff not only at the reception but the restaurant staff we exceptional with nothing too much trouble for them and we were always greeted with a smile and were extremely courteous....rare in Spain I have to say based on our experiences.  We will definitely be back to stay again...but not in August it would have been unbearable if not for the air conditioning.  Only downside..disappointingly breakfast is far too expensive for what was on offer so would advise to go out for breakfast.,5,2012,08,28
14,"Beautiful Hotel, gorgeous air conditioned bedrooms!","This Hotel is a jewel of a find in the Gothic quarter of the City, reception staff were excellent and our rooms exceeded our expectations, the bedrooms were very clean, nice in decor with fabulous bathrooms, very quiet and air conditioning that worked and didn't keep you awake, we have found our new home when visiting Barcelona! Roof terrace is nice, service is poor and the barmans attitude doesn't go with the rest of the service we received but he won't put us off staying again! Would be nice if there was a toilet on the roof terrace as you have to go to your room.",5,2012,08,26
14,Magnificent Old World Charm,"We found Hotel Neri at Hotels.com, and I liked its location--Barri Gotic in Barcelona, Sp.  It is a medieval building among many in Old Town set in an alley with shops and tourists. It was a small palace, and though renovated, still has the Old World charm.  All employees were cordial and attentive.  The room was so different from most hotels.  The decor and comfortable bed welcomed us with a peaceful, warm ambience after a long day of touring. Great experience in a beautiful city!",5,2012,08,20
14,A jewel in the Barri Gotic,"We spent two nights in a Junior suite .. thanks to my girlfriend flying us to Barcelona as a birthday treat for me :)
The Hotel is wonderful with only 22 rooms .. a blend of old and new .. quiet, sophisticated, tastefully decorated, and the staff attentive and helpful. Kudos to Vincent in reception for getting us Sagrada Familia tickets ON-LINE ..which means not having to deal with the world and his wife queueing to get in, and to Guillermo our waiter on the roof top oasis who kept the Cava coming on a very hot day.

The bed was the biggest certainly and arguably the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom clean, towels fresh and even the luxury of a ceiling mounted infra-red lamp to keep you warm out of the shower. 
The shower was slate lined .. gorgeous! Great flow of water too.

The A/C was a must and a blessing
I couldn't fault the hotel, and have no hesitation in recommending it to the traveller who wants a touch of luxury in the old part of town.

As a postscript, I read other reviews and would like to answer two points. 
Regarding the taxi not driving you to the door .. they physically can't .. it's not possible .. the walk from the closest square is 500 yards tops.
 
As for the drains smelling,when I read this review comment I thought the reviewer meant the hotel drains but they must have meant the local sanitation which is both old and beyond the control of the hotel .. we were there in early August and I wasn't at all perturbed by the smell.",5,2012,08,20
14,Not really a Relais & Chateaux!!!,"Location Superb! In the heart of the Gotic quarter!!! room with sound proof. As a lady I miss a mirrow at the room (just in the toillet). At the reception very warm welcome but one night we have to wait nearly 10 minutes till someone came to open us the front door!! (was around 11:30PM). Once we arrived at the hotel at 5PM to take a little rest (siesta - August the summer is there!) and the room wasn't done yet! Actually not really a Relais & Chateaux level. Below expectations.....
At the lounge bar we order a natural juice and they brought to us a small glass with industrial juice.....:-((",3,2012,08,20
14,Wonderful hotel and location,"My wife and I spent 2 nights in a junior suite after our Regent's cruise ended in Barcelona.  We couldn't have been happier with the quality of the hotel and the location. It really is in the heart of the Gotic area and a wonderful place to experience the vibe of Barcelona.  It is an easy walk to shopping, historical sites, and plenty of places to eat.   Speaking of food we did eat on the patio outside of the hotel on our last night where people watching is prime and the food was great.  We both had the seasonal tasting menu, and it was fabulous.  If you looking for the boutique hotel experience in the heart of the city, then you will not be disappointed.
Also,  getting to and from the hotel by taxi was much easier and quicker than I was lead to believe by other reviews.",5,2012,08,17
14,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is located in the heart of Gothic quarter and is absolutely wonderful.  The staff were very polite and little touches like greeting you with a handshake and taking you around the hotel before escorting you to your room were very personal.  The rooms are beautiful and we had the most wonderful time there.  Breakfast was very good (not a buffet), it is cooked as per your order from the menu and was very tasty.   No parking but they have special rates arranged with a parking bay near by.  Very beautiful roof terrace, worth a visit for a drink.  Overall the experience was fantastic and highly recommend this hotel if you are after some excellent service and great time in Barcelona.",5,2012,08,14
14,Wonderful hotel,"From the moment we walked through the glass doors into the lobby I knew we were in a very special place. The location in the old Barri Gotic is magical. Although the hotel is a short walk over to the crazy scene that is La Rambla, the sights and sounds of the quiet alleyways and twisting streets of the quarter is what I will remember most from our visit to Barcelona. We dined one night at the hotel's restaurant outdoors looking out onto the Placa de Sant Felip. The meal was delicious, but what was memorable was watching the cast of characters visiting the suare. From the young man playing his guitar to the street performer, the sound of the fountain, knowing the tragic history of the square, it was a night I will cherish always. The hotel is beautifully decorated, truly deserving of it's Relais Chateau designation. The rooftop bar is a wonderful oasis to have a glass of wine and snack after a long day exploring the city. Every time we returned to the hotel I always felt I was returning to a quiet, elegant refuge. I would be remiss if I didn't mention Jacobo. This wonderful young man was gracious and always most helpful. His suggestions for dinner were always spot on. He is a wonderful asset to the hotel. My only regret is that we didn't return to the Hotel Neri on the latter end of our trip, having already committed to another hotel. ",5,2012,08,07
14,"Lovely hotel, excellent location.","Stayed at the Neri for 6 nights in a junior suite. The room was well appointed and had very comfy bed, lovely bathroom. Staff were friendly and helpful and the food for breakfast and dinner in the restaurant was excellent. The location is central in the Gothic area, a two minute walk to the Cathedral. Taxi from the airport to Place Jaume about 30 euro and a short walk up to the hotel. On leaving the hotel booked the taxi and we were collected from the door.
Good local restaurants a few minutes walk away, especially La Pla. The area felt a lot safer than we expected having read other reviews of Barcelona and we look forward to returning.
Small issue with wine to the room coinciding with peak restaurant service time a niggle. All other service was very helpful, especially from Anya in the restaurant, and staff at reception. Music and locals dancing in front of the Cathedral on Sunday morning was very moving!",5,2012,07,31
14,Not your average hotel,"First trip to BCN for the wife and I. This hotel was a fine choice for us. We prefer to travel and feel like we are part of the environment. This hotel fits perfectly. This is not a cookie cutter place at all. Boutique - well yeah, but very relaxed. The decor reminds one of a more Northern Euro look, with that sleekness and economy of furnishings.

The getting to and from requires some stamina. The front door is actually on a tiny alley, not really large enough for an automobile. So be prepared for some baggage toting. A small inconvenience so don't let that give you a sour disposition.

The hotel itself is ultimately in a great location. Very easy jaunts to see the a lot of the best of BCN's architecture. The staff was quite helpful and, well, happy. They seemed to take a good deal of pride in their establishment. 

The restaurant is actually a bonus - an eclectic menu and warm friendly service. A good breakfast is a nice way to start a day of sightseeing.",4,2012,07,30
14,Location and Comfort,Barcelona was our last stop on a recent holiday and a friend recommended Hotel Neri.  It didn't disappoint.  Hotel Neri is located smack bang in the middle of El Gotic.  Our cab driver from the train station couldn't get us in there but he dropped us pretty close and we walked the rest.  We were on the 3rd floor and had a view over Place de St Felip Neri.  Room was very comfortable for us and our daughter.  Staff are excellent as is the in hotel restaurant where we dined one evening.  Roof top bar not so good - better to have a drink downstairs at the bar on Place de St Felip Neri.  Hotel is very close to the main market La Boqueria which is a great place to have breakfast  - try the Pinotxo Bar.   Walking distance to many sites and close to Metro.  Highly recommended.,5,2012,07,25
14,Sketches of Spain,"If you are into the non-genric, quaint, boutique style hotels, this is the place to stay. My husband and I stayed at Hotel Neri for six nights; everything was great. The staff was hospitable and helpful. Our junior suite was very roomy, the decor was contemporary, and we had a birds-eye view of the Placa Sant Felip Neri. This hotel is a great little gem. It's nestled in the streets of the Barri Gotic, next to the Cathedral. Great accessibility to other parts of Barcelona.",5,2012,07,13
14,Interesting Location,"We stayed 2 nights at the Neri at the end of our Spanish trip. The hotel is hard to find in a narrow street in the Gothic Quarter. It is a small trendy hotel. The standard room was ok but very small compared to other hotels in Barcelona at the same price. The rooftop bar was not great and after a quick look, we decided to go out of the hotel for a drink. Breakfast was a mixture of self service and a tray of goodies brought to your table - we really enjoyed this format.
This was not our favorite part of Barcelona and if you return to the hotel late at night, be aware as there are many interesting characters hanging around these small streets.
We are glad we chose the Neri but not a hotel we will be returning to.",4,2012,07,11
14,No place better in Barcelona,This is a great hotel.  It is a little hard to find but so worth it.  We arranged for a driver through the Neri to pick us up from the airport.  Our friends used a taxi and just gave him the phone number and their driver called and found out where it was.  It is in a great location right by the cathedral.  The staff was vey helpful from how to get to places to getting us a cab to get to our cruise.  The room was great.  Vey chic and tasteful.  Lots of room and a great bathroom.  We even had a hamock on the balcony.  It is a 5 star hotel in every sense.  We will be back.,5,2012,07,10
14,Absolutely Fabulous,"My wife and I stayed here one night at the end of a two week cruise and we loved the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are really beautiful. I wish we had more time to stay as one night was not enough.

The hotel is in the heart of the Gothic quarter and is just a few minutes from many of the main sites in Barcelona. The staff was great, they even came to find us when the taxi couldn’t get to the front door.

We splurged and stayed in one of the junior suites, it was a great room very modern but done so that it fit the character of the building and the gothic quarter.",5,2012,07,09
14,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel was just perfect for what we needed. Situated in the centre of the gothic quarter this hidaway hit all the right spots for a romantic getaway. The room was very large and modern, with a great bath. The hotel provided a DVD and CD library too which was a nice touch for when we wanted to chill out in the room. Breakfast is vast and delicious, so well worth the extra money. 
Staff are welcoming and helpful especially if you do not know the area and need some advice on things to do and places to eat that are not tourist traps.
The entire hotel is well decorated and the roof top bar area is a nice place to enjoy a cocktail at sunset. 

I would recommend dinner at 'La Pla' restaurant about a 5 minutes walk away.",5,2012,07,05
14,Great place,"The Hotel Neri is difficult to find, but once you are esconced there you will be very pleased.  It is luxurious but in an understated way.  I don't usually stay at pricey places, but reserved in advance with a 20% discount (nonrefundable!) and that brought it into the affordable range for me.  When I checked in, I was upgraded to a better room...so that got things off to a good start!

The location is fantastic, in the heart of the Barri Gotic, within a few blocks of the ""Rambla"" (where there is a handy metro stop) and the incredible ""Boqueria"" market, and near the beautiful Cathedral.  It's a little noisy at times because of the school children playing in the nearby square, but this was a minor problem.  The desk staff tried hard to be accomodating, but this was a bit difficult because of the language barrier.

I would highly recommend the breakfast, which I had served in my room...a vast array of fruits, pastries, cheeses, eggs, jamon, etc...all in little separate dishes.  It costs 22 euros and it's worth it!

Barcelona is a very busy, somewhat chaotic city (in a good way!)...so it was nice to be able to retreat to the Hotel Neri for some peace, quiet, and luxury.",4,2012,06,24
14,"Nice public space, rooms could use some help","We only had four nights in Barcelona on our way to Provence and the Neri sounded perfect. Close to the cathedral in the old town, it hit all the boxes for a cool, sexy place. The lobby is very pretty but occasionally there was a sewer smell that my wife picked up on. Breakfast in the dining room was terrific: big plate with small dishes of at least 10 different things. All good, all fresh. The room was a little less of a hit. We got an upgrade and if this is an upgrade I would hate to see a standard room. In my opinion it consisted of a chair in front of the closet. There was a terrace but rotting floorboards and some sort of dirty mattress platform made it less than inviting. All in all, it's not bad but I have stayed at many Relais & Chateaux over the years and I would look a little deeper in Barcelona before I did this place again.",4,2012,06,22
14,An oasis in the city,"This place is truly a jewel.  The whole hotel is beautifully decorated.  The staff is excellent, gracious and helpful.  The room itself was a delightful haven, with a grotto-like bathroom.   Our room was overlooking a tiny plaza, quite picturesque.  After wandering around Barcelona all day, it's wonderful to have an oasis in the city.  I was enchanted by the place.

Although as some mentioned, the exact location is a bit obscure, it is in a very good area.  It is on a pedestrian street, but there's parking underneath the cathedral nearby, so it's really not that difficult, and fairly typical for the older portion of a European city.",5,2012,06,11
14,Almost stayed here,"I booked Hotel Neri for our last night of a two week trip in BCN and Costa Brava area. I always like to end a trip on a high note and Hotel Neri sounded perfect. Unfortunately about two days prior to our arrival I received an email from the manager indicating they had electrical issues on the 3rd and 4th Fl. and it was not expected to be finished by the time of our arrival. They had made arrangements for us to stay at 1898, same type of room (higher price at 1898 but no problem Neri price honored) including breakfast. This was a major problem for a fully booked hotel to have to relocate so many people on short notice and they handled it very professionally including checking with us upon our return home to make sure all went okay. I was so impressed by their handling of this. I regret not being able to experience the hotel on this trip as location and ambiance seems so beautiful. If we return to BCN Neri will be our first choice. This Relais & Chateaux property really provides some excellent customer service.",5,2012,06,05
14,A very hidden Gem,"Getting there is not half the fun.  We got a taxi from the airport (the driver couldn't speak any English and we don't speak Spanish) so she put the hotel address in her GPS.  At a random corner, she motioned to us to get out of the taxi and pointed up a pedestrian-only street.  We were never informed by the hotel that it was in a pedestrian-only area.  So we slepped our large suitcases up the cobblestone street.  After about 5 blocks when we didn't see the hotel, we started asking people where it was by showing them the address.  Finally we made it to a larger plaza, found a policeman, who then directed us to the small alley where the hotel was hiding.  After we finally checked in and got settled in our room, we loved the place.  Great modern decor, very dramatic.  The desk clerk was extremely nice and helpful.  Our room was beautiful and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  There was a small bar in the hotel where we had a quiet drink before venturing out into the night for dinner.  The old historic area is a maze of small streets and alleyways.  We had a lovely breakfast in the dining room (it was being remodeled and was closed for dinner). 

 Our next problem came when we tried to meet friends for a pick up to continue on with our trip to visit Catalon wine makers.  They couldn't drive in to the hotel and the square where we had arranged to meet them was closed by the police because of a demonstration.  After hauling our luggage back to the hotel, the desk clerk arranged for a taxi to make it in to the hotel, pick us up, and get us to a meeting point outside the historic area.  Whew!  We loved the hotel, but would only stay there again if we were traveling really light.",5,2012,05,20
14,Fabulous Hotel,Recently stayed here.  My 2nd visit to this hotel and it was superb.  Amazing location surrounded by gothic buildings down a narrow alley and an incredible restoration job.  Breakfast was a bit slow but we were on holiday so didn't really mind and food was beautiful.  It is a really central location and rooms are comfortable and well appointed.  Definitely worth the extra bucks we spent...,5,2012,04,24
14,Top design and location,"Stayed there in april of 2010 and again april 2012. As good as before. Location is unique in the heart of the Gothic quarter. No cars.  Historic building redone to highest standards with comfortable modern rooms and spectacular bathrooms. Rooftop terrace and an overall relaxed ambience add to the appeal.  
You have a choice of regular cancellable reservattions or nonrefundable at 20% discount. To complain when the latter are not refunded for whatever reason is silly.  It is your resonsibility if you do not take inurance.  Not a ripoff at all.  ",5,2012,04,12
14,rip-off hotel,"I booked at this hotel and was forced to cancel my reservation due to a family emergency. The hotel showed no compassion at all and charged me the entire cost of my stay, over 1000 euros.",1,2012,03,31
14,Into another world.,"Hotel Neri is in the magic town, Barcelona. As you enter everything is magic, the sounds from hidden speakers, the smell of the oriental and the interior is fascinating , you take the elevator to your room, again you are spelled.Bathroom is very different from what you are used to, bare and rough stones, marble and indirect lightning.Stereo in the room with special music you can get if you want it.Nice big double beds, completely silence around you, you can have a room to the back side where you look to a small but very old fountain. Its just like stepping into another planet of sounds, smells and silence.
We went there for our 25 anniversary, unforgettable(2007)",5,2012,03,28
14,Unique place in the Barri Gothic,"I stayed there in February a couple of years ago and am looking into coming back this year. I forgot to write a review. The rooms are wonderful, with unique design, the location is smack in the middle of Barri Gothic which makes Barcelona so special, it's steps away from all the restaurants and shopping you'll ever want or need in Barcelona. It's a little different, since you have to walk the last few minutes (cars don't drive in the small alleys in the old town,) and not everyone's cup of tea for that reason, but I think it's one of the lovelier places to stay in Barca. It was also very quiet, which is a plus for me. 

The staff had trouble understanding and speaking English when we were there, but they really tried their best. The sinks in the deluxe bathrooms look cool, but they're a little impractical and didn't drain properly. Apart from that, the stay was wonderful!",5,2012,01,22
14,Stylish Boutique,Cannot say enough about this hotel. Great staff. Wonderful restaurant. Great location.,5,2012,01,05
14,Very Disappointing Stay,"Where should I begin? The hotel lobby had a foul odor; apparently the plumbing in this area of Barcelona is quite old. This odor, unfortunately,  followed us up to our hotel room and as the vent/fan system is not adjustable in the rooms, we had to call someone to fix this problem. The hotel did adjust the fan, however, the foul smell permeating our room continued on and off throughout our stay, so we needed to keep a window open for air flow. No problem except that the hotel is located in a very busy alley where there is a lot of foot traffic and noise throughout the evening. To add to this problem, our toilet broke, and the hotel was unable to fix it as it was a holiday weekend and had no plumber available.  As they had no other rooms available, we had to make due by going into the toilet's tank each time we needed to flush. This is not the way a supposed first rate hotel should operate! WiFi was down for much of our stay as well. The hotel blamed it on the hotel being full to capacity. Really?! The hotel also charged us what added up to approximately $85 per night for an additional bed in the room. I realize this is standard practice in Europe, however, I would hope they would have accommodated us in some way with all the problems we encountered! We couldn't even get complimentary coffee in the morning. When we called room service for ice cream in the evening, the hotel said the machine was not on, so again, they could not accommodate us. The hotel staff was very indifferent and very inexperienced. Had we stayed in a 1 or 2 star hotel, our expectations would have been much different. However, for the prices the Hotel Neri charges, it is incomprehensible that anyone would stay here. Upon check-out, they said they were sorry we did not enjoy our stay. Really?!",1,2012,01,03
14,WONDERFUL & VERY SPECIAL!!,"I loved this lovely little boutique hotel so much, I wish I could have lived there forever, and you can't beat the location!! Neri is located right in the middle of the Gothic Barrio right behind the cathedral next to the very difficult to find San Felipe Neri Square (which in my opinion is one of the most special places on earth). 

We stayed in a junior suite, which I would recommend; more spacious and beautiful furnishings. We had 3 beautiful balconies that overlooked the walk-streets. The hotel is a formal medieval palace, so it has a lot of charm and is artisticly chic. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It was pricey but this property is totally worth it. If I ever go back Barcelona I will only stay at the Hotel Neri.",5,2011,12,21
14,Artistic/Boutique Hotel but dodgy area,"We stayed there from 7th Sep-10th Sep, my husband & I, After I had finally managed to get a booking just a week earlier via phone, Since I admire staying in design boutique hotels for their unique character & stylish interior also for the limited number of suites/rooms. 
I read so much about it online by simply googling for a boutique hotel in the ruins/historic sites...etc then NERI was there, images online were so amazing, and the person I booked through was also really nice & helpful. 
When we arrived in Barcelona, hotel staff were really helpful to assist us direct our taxi driver to the hotel. Once we got there we simply did the checking in procedures and one of the staff showed us around and took us to our suite, it was really lovely, its exactly my taste in furniture and colors, for my husband it was the opposite effect he didnt like it at all, he expects large bright rooms, but he didnt say anything since he knew I was excited about staying in a vintage historic hotel. we had a tiny terrace u can stand out on it but the area itself isnt what you would expect, facing another building, barely 2 meters away from our hotel, and that was one of things that disturbed us both, is having these strange people in the streets doing noise and even people who are simply talking and passing by you could here everything while you tried to sleep (though the bed itself was amazingly comfortable and I can sleep anywhere if my bed is cozy, clean & fresh with big fluffy pillows) if it werent for the drunk workers outside. We also enjoyed their small bar just downstairs from the back entrance of the hotel, around a small fountain, its really dodgy area though, we were having a bite in the outdoor seating area, and suddenly you see 2 drug dealers exchanging stuff probably & you look around thinking this must be a movie!! How on earth are these people doing these things & its in midday! Well, its not a movie, then police 2 seconds later drive through on their bikes, and the guys act as if they weren't doing anything wrong, but people in the restaurant don't dare to say anything, afraid from those 2 men. 
So hotel is great but the area even though its behind the cathedral simply steps away, but its full of drug addicts and alcoholics wandering around and its not the Neri""s problem. We didn't have any complaints about anything cause all was working fine in our suite, other than the safe, its basically a box with a password, its separated from the closet, but its inside, but I wouldn't trust leaving my valuables and going out knowing somebody can simply go in our suite and take the safe out with him/her. But we didn't have any issues thankfully! We didnt have breakfast in the hotel but we had a snack as I mentioned down int heir bar. Other than that, there was plenty of good cafes around. We also asked the hotel staff to advise us whats the best way to go to Sabadell, 30 min out of Barcelona, hoping to meet my wedding dress designer, The staff member he was actually from that area and gladly assisted us and ordered the taxi to take us to our destination. Hotel staff were really nice I dont blame people or a hotel for having bad/noisy neighbors. One more thing, The toiletries are really good and all you need to buy is some toothpaste & deodorant! Take the open bus tour if you go in Spring, buy the 2 day access if you're there for a weekend, its really good and worth it, takes you all around the city, up and down hills & mountains, to the sea and to the poor areas also, its interesting to see all this, you can hop on & off anytime, every 15 min another bus passes by at the same stops, it can get really busy so make sure you get there on time so you guarantee to get a seat on the bus!",5,2011,12,15
14,Great Design and Location,"The Hotel Neri has a very stylish and charming design! It's something between old town palace, asian-style leisure, and artistic chic. Junior Suites with roof terrace are phenomenal! There's even a hammock! They have thought of every single detail in the room, the bathroom is awesome! They have even noted our pre-arrival wish of having two separate duvets instead of one king-size!

Breakfast ist delicious and very versitile. It's well worth the money, especially when sitting on Placa Neri or on their romantic roof terrace.

The staff is very professional and accomodating. They care about everything you might need.

And the location can't get any better! You literally live where tourists gather to get told about the history of the location. It's a few steps from the cathedral, 5 minutes from Born quarter, 5 minutes from Ramblas, but at the same time quiet.",5,2011,11,22
14,A perfect boutique hotel!,My husband and I just returned from a lovely trip to Barcelona. We stayed at the Neri for 6 nights and just loved the hotel.Wonderful location and very helpful staff especially Mar at reception. Our room overlooked the lovely San Felipe Neri square and the church bells and school children just added to the charm of this lovely hotel. The Neri was peace and tranquility.,5,2011,11,13
14,Great Stay and a Fantastic Location,"Overall, our stay at Neri was fantastic. It's tucked away in a quiet side street away from the crowds, but just a stone throw's away from old-world barcelona charm and attractions. The hotel staff service was impeccable and everything was very clean. I especially appreciated the design of the hotel. I find that lots of ""modern"" boutique hotels in Europe go over the top and lose their old-world charm, but Neri found a good balance between the two. The bedding was so comfortable that it made my wife want to get the same kind for our home. My only complaint would be that the room we stayed in was in need of some minor renovation. It was all very nice and clean, but it's starting to show its age.",4,2011,11,13
14,Just beautiful.,"In the heart of the Gothic Quarter sits this beautiful little hotel with surprisingly modern interior design. There is a perfect balance of old and new with the stunningly beautiful stone lobby, stone tiled bathrooms, reclaimed wood closets and doors paired with bright modern paintings, fixtures and furniture.  

The location is perfect. You can easily walk to many great shops and restaurants in the GQ as well as the cathedral. It's a busy place, so you will get some noise if the windows are open, but that's part of the fun. 

The only downside I can think of is that a cab can't let you off at the door, so you'll need a rolling suitcase for the short walk from the square to the hotel. But it's worth it to stay in this gorgeous hotel. Not only do I long to stay there again, I kind of want to move in.",5,2011,11,11
14,An oasis nestled in the heart of the Gothic district,"The good (and we found it superb): If you want to experience the reality of life in the heart of the historic part of this beautiful city, this is the place for you. It's a quaint and tastefully decorated boutique hotel with surprise touches everywhere you go - hot chocolate in the library/lounge, a selection of your favourite music (CD) in your room, custom linen and bedding, an outdoor terrasse just off the Neri Restaurant with a fountain tucked away in the courtyard, spacious bathroom and rooms filled with light and every amenity you could want. If it's not there, you need only ask the friendly and efficient staff. Where else in the old gothic quartier can you find a sensational rooftop terrace with a stunning view overlooking one of the nearby cathedrals...it was a treat after spending the days exploring other parts of the city that were crammed with tourists. I agree with the guest who said that the schoolchildren laughing and playing in the courtyard just added to the wonderful atmosphere and it didn't deter us from the afternoon siesta as we simply closed the window. The guide books don't tell you that this is one of the safest hotel locations in the entire city because of its proximity to nearby government and police offices. The added plus is that almost everything is within 15 minutes walking distance and the Metro system is one of the easiest to navigate on the planet.
The Bad: Not much to say here, except that there is ongoing construction just across from the hotel entrance and because of the very narrow streets, construction noise can literally be just across the street (less than 10 feet away) if your room is located on the Calle Sant Sever side.  Secondly, I'd strongly recommend going with the hotel transport on your way in. Yes, it's twice as expensive, but well worth it as we actually got a guided tour once we entered the city and found this invaluable since we knew all the major monuments/buildings and never got lost after that. If you chose the airport taxis, you could easily get lost or you'd have to lug your suitcases down cobblestone streets, which is no fun. The hotel was happy to call a regular cab service on our way back to the airport (costs between 30-35 Euro depending on traffic).
The Ugly: Can't think of anything to add with regards to this hotel. However, I will share one ugly experience about Barcelona in general. Everyone knows to be on the look-out for pickpockets, and they are rampant (especially in La Boqueria)! but I would like to add that you should stay away from the young locals who are always in the plazas tossing those neon blue spinning tops into the air. They are apparently drug dealers as we witnessed in one not-so-pleasant show-down with a group of mobile police one evening.",5,2011,11,04
14,Suberp - Highly Recommended,"Beautiful, atmospheric hotel with everything you could need. Other reviews mentioned the noise of builders and the school - but that all added to the `city` atmosphere for us and was only what you would expect. Certainly no negative points or issue`s. All staff were excellent and nothing too much trouble. The food was at the top of the tree quality wise - `Michelin` should be informed.  If ever we return to Barcelona then we would not waste time looking for anything better.  Perfect location, Perfect Hotel.  Many Thanks.",5,2011,10,13
14,Surprisingly good,"We were a little skeptical of the location initially. After being in Barcelona for three days, however, we found the Neri to be well-located, in the heart of the Gothic quarter, very friendly, secure and very comfortable. We made reservations through Tablet Hotels and were upgraded to a junior suite. Noisy outside until 10 pm or so, then very quiet.  School in the courtyard starts about 8:30.  Enjoyed our stay immensely.",4,2011,09,30
14,Perfect location in Barri Gothic,"We stayed three nights at the Neri, and could not have made a better choice in Barcelona. It was a bit hard to find -- we took the metro to the Liceu stop and walked, and the streets are a bit confusing. But what a find! The room was elegant, we had a view of the Neri plaza, and the staff was superb. We had dinner one night in the restaurant (did not have breakfasts there) and highly recommend eating there. The Neri was a great base for exploring the old town on foot, and was easy walking distance to everything from the Picasso Museum to the Plaza Catalunya.  The staff was great, and made restaurant recommendations and reservations as well.",5,2011,09,24
14,Location/Comfort/Service,"Bit hard to find, just adds to the appeal. The antithesis of a large Hotel- I know almost everyone in Barcelona speaks English, but really the front of Hotel staff were outstanding. Excellent dining recommendations from Jacob. We had a Junior Suite- 6 nights- spacious, bedding etc. superb. Couple of things you had to ask for, but came quickly.
Brekky/Dinner X1- very impressed- should have dined there more. A point off for the Wi-Fi- patchy in the room, but worked outside at the tables in the square!
15 minute walk seems to take you just about everywhere. Not cheap, but money V. well spent.",5,2011,09,22
14,Loved the Location,"Stayed at Hotel Neri for 3 nights prior to a cruise. Taxi let us off by the cathedral and had to walk with our luggage to the hotel since the small alley was blocked by a car.  It's an easy walk up on street, make a right, and you'd walk right by the front door unless you were looking for it. Initially, I was put off by the small alley and some grafitti, but as you tour Barcelona, you see that grafitti is quite prevalent, but in an artistic kind of way.

The hotel was smaller than I expected from viewing the pictures online, but they were true to the images online.  There is a desk where check in occurs and they handle one person at a time which makes for a more personal experience.  I had to consult with the front desk a few other times and the staff always was pleasant and helpful.  

Was in room #208 which is a corner room with two windows.  One window looked straight into someone's apartment and the other window looked right into the construction project so while we had 2 windows, we kept the curtains closed for privacy.  The room was on the smaller side since I picked the a standard room, but there was enough space for two people. Lots of little sundries in the bathroom in case you forgot something.  Liked the in-room safe and hair dryer.  There is no in-room coffee, but you can order for $7 euro for coffee & milk.  Let me share that the room was exceptionally clean.  Loved the bathroom with the stone shower and loved the rain shower head.  The room had bathrobes and slippers which were handy.  Also, the room has an umbrella that we never had to use, but convenient if it rained.

We did hear the noise from the construction (hammering, guys talking), but it was very minor and never interefered with our stay.  Did not hear any children in the morning so I believe we were on the opposite side of the courtyard. In any case, noise was never an issue for us.  In fact, if I were to go to Barcelona again, I'd much prefer a room with a more remote location as Hotel Neri than a stay on the crazy, loud Las Ramblas.  Hotels on that street may get higher ratings, but there is too much commotion on that street for my liking.

While the Barri Gotic does have odd streets that meander and it's easy to get lost, I found it extremely charming and am so glad I stayed here rather than the Palace which I also had been considering.  There are tons of unique shops and very friendly shop owners in this side of town.  There are great tapas bars around the corner, major shopping just a few streets away, Las Ramblas is a short 5 minute walk, and Plaza Cataluyna is about 8 minutes away.  We walked all over due the central location, but did take a cab to see a flamenco show.

When I was ready to board the ship, the hotel called a cab and the cab backed up right to the front door so that made it very easy when we left.

Overall, I really enjoyed staying in the old section of town, in an older building, but with modern conveniences and a modern decor.  Would recommend this hotel to my friends if they were going to Barcelona.",5,2011,09,18
14,"Very Nice Hotel, but Bring Earplugs","The Neri is a very nice hotel located in the Barri Gotic very close to the cathedral (not the Gaudi one, the old, beautiful one) and La Rambla.  You reach it by taking the subway or a taxi to Pl. Jaume and then walking a couple of blocks along narrow streets.

As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, they like stonework here.  The bath is a stone floor, with stone walls.  We liked it.  The room got nicely chilly (we prefer no higher than 65 degrees to sleep), which was a welcome relief from the 90 degree heat of Barcelona and the equaly hot hallways in the hotel.  The bed was quite comfortable - maybe too much so, since we ended up sleeping very late the first morning.

The other reviewers frequently pointed out the noise from the school kids in the courtyard outside.  Normally, when I think of European hotels with a courtyard, I envision a hotel where the rooms facing the street are noisy, but those on the interior are quiet.  Not here.  Our room had windows on two sides - one looked across into apartments about 10 feet away, while the other fronted onto that damned little courtyard.  Who knew you could put several dozen young children in there at 7:30 in the morning and get them all to scream at the top of their lungs?  Add to that the sound of construction (I suppose there will always be something under renovation in the quarter), and you had better be planning to get up early.

The staff were very pleasant and helpful.  We did not sample the restaurant, since the initial offer of breakfast for 19 Euros was simply too high to even consider.  We visited the rooftop terrace two nights - once when there was a staffer but no guests, and a second time when there were guests trying to get served, but no one on duty.  We never did figure out the right time when there would be something going on.

All in all, a very nice property that just needs to figure out how to control noise.",4,2011,09,16
14,Hotel Neri,Ideal location in the heart of Barcelona.  Very nice conversion of old building into modern city centre hotel.  Food very good- service quietly efficient,5,2011,09,15
14,A Haven in the city,My Husband & I just had a very quiet stay at this (very beautiful) Hotel. Good mix of quality design & quirkiness with very comfy beds and a selection of pillows. The classy & romantic roof terrace serves fabulous Margaritas. We didn't breakfast in the restaurant as we prefer a lighter airier space in the morning. We dined there but wouldn't do so again as it's style over substance and thinks it's serving better food than it actually is (looks posh but quite bland). Despite evidence of a renovation underway opposite we weren't disturbed at all. Would return to stay again but wouldn't eat there as so many lovely restaurants on the doorstep. We stayed in room 305 which is the room with the balcony wrapped around 2 sides which we had requested but didn't use. All in all a great experience.,4,2011,09,13
14,"great, fantastic.","What a great hotel right in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. The location was fantastic, the staff very polite and helpful. Our room overlooked the courtyard. It was so nice to lay back on the bed and listen to the sound of children playing, the bell sounding every hour and the general chatter of people. It all was very peaceful and the hotel beautiful. we took a small travel kettle which came in really handy as we like our tea. They have bath robes, slippers, and a hair dryer. It is tucked away a little, just find the Gaudi museum, then walk behind the cathedral  which is right next to it.. You have arrived!",5,2011,08,23
14,"small jewel in a grand city, Barcelona","We stayed at the Neri pre cruise in late June for 2 nights.  Everything was lovely, from the room upgrade to the car they sent for us at the airport.  We arrived early and had to wait an hour for our room to be ready but went out and with the help of the concierge found a churro stand, they were just as I remembered  from my teen years and we had a  lively political discussion about the state of things to boot.   Our room was not large but fine by any standards, the bathroom very modern and different. The bed was just the right firmness and the linens and toiletries were top notch. The lighting was good for reading in bed. The lobby was very contemporary yet plush and inviting, not stark and cold.  The staff could not have been nicer, we were even invited to a private yearly party that the hotel was sponsoring for some media group.  We made use of the roof top patio  in the afternoon and it felt like a private hotel.  The only other people we kept bumping into was the actress Vanessa Redgrave and her party.  It is a very private place and I can understand why people who need privacy seek it out.  We loved the location, just a few blocks fro  Plaza Catalunya and next to the Cathedral, and at the top of Las Ramblas but not close to the craziness of the Ramblas. Behind us was a convent school  and the small plaza courtyard, very historically important.  It is on a very narrow alley and we could almost touch the collection of shoes of person living across the alley. It was very safe. We were out at all hours and there were always people walking by. We walked everywhere but cabs were not expensive and the cab drivers were very pleasant.  Breakfast was a treat, worth every penny and you could skip lunch after having it.  There was no street noise to be heard, except for the bells of the cathedral which I found soothing. We will definitely be returning.  Loved the Neri, thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2011,08,14
14,Won't be going back,"Our first night at the hotel was lovely, our room was big with a lovely balcony wrapping around it. Then at 7.30am in the morning the builders opposite started drilling and tapping away at the building they were working on, the windows aren't double glazed so it literally felt like we were on a building site. I went down to reception, they had know about this before we arrived and hadn't thought to warn us before we checked in. We asked to be moved but were then told that all the suites with terraces faced this building site! Except one, we were shown this spare room and it was tiny with no balcony, it didn't look like a suite and I would certainly not have paid a suite price for it. I then asked if we could downgrade and were told there wasn't any other rooms available. the guy on reception was rally unhelpful and also acknowledged that the suite room was tiny, at no time were we offered a discount to stay in this room and not other solution was provided. I couldn't put up with another morning of building work so we checked out and went to the mirror hotel instead, it's a bit further out but the rooms and much nicer, staff more helpful and they have a small pool on the room. Plus it's cheaper. Maybe ask if the building work is still going on before booking at expensive room at this hotel.",2,2011,08,11
14,"Nice hotel, but","Hotel is very nice and clean.  It's a good location around a bunch of shops around the area.  Hotel staff were nice and helpful.  The website shows they have a office/internet room, but in reality there is a lounge, but no internet.  
Restaurant is nice, but menu was limited.  There were 7 of us and we were not allowed to order off the menu, but told we had to buy a preset 3 course meal and couldn't order off the menu.  Seems very limiting and makes you wonder if it was something done to Americans who don't know any better?  The breakfast buffet was very good, with lot's of food.  Highly recommend the breakfast buffet, just eat elsewhere for dinner.",4,2011,08,02
14,Gorgeous small hotel right in the old town,"Recently stayed 4 nights in the Neri for a long weekend, wedding anniversary celebration. 
I had carefully read all the reviews and was not disappointed.  Lovely room (junior suite ) with terrace, which I preferred to extra interior space-   It was hot and coming from cooler climes I would rather be outside-  how much time do you spend inside your room in  the summer?Terrace gave complete privacy but therefore had no view - you can't have both. It is a matter of personal choice - see photo. An individual hotel with plenty of character and lovely food. The only problem is deciding whether to opt for the sumptious breakfasts and then  risk having less space for lunch. Easy to reach if you can read a map  ( less than 10 mins walk from Playa Catalunya) and great location in the heart of the old town.",5,2011,08,01
14,Great Central Location,A nice hotel in a central location. If you get a cab there take a map with you as its a couple of minutes walk from where you're dropped off. Attentive staff.,4,2011,07,29
14,Pros & Cons,"The room was kept very clean, however towels weren't replaced w/ new, clean towels on a daily basis. The room we had overlooked the courtyard area, which happened to be a kid's play area. The kids were VERY loud, so taking an afternoon nap was out of the question, which interferes with enjoying Barcelona's night life. This ended up really messing up our vacation schedule. Check-in is not until 13:00, and the hotel doesn't have decent accommodations for guests waiting for their room to be available. So, if your itinerary has you arriving early, you will want to book elsewhere. For us, waiting for the room was brutal b/c we were very fatigued/dehydrated from a long flight. The restaurant staff is top notch (hotel staff is average), and the food is gastronomique.",3,2011,07,19
14,Beautiful boutique hotel in a perfect position,"This hotel is in an ideal position, very central and easy to walk to many parts of the city. The hotel has great character and charm and is the perfect blend of old meets new. We loved our stay here and highly recommend it.",5,2011,06,25
14,Heaven tucked away in the beautiful streets of Barcelona,The Neri is an oasis among the Gothic area streets in Barcelona. As a remodelled convent it holds all the beauty with modern decor throughout. We had a junior suite that is perfect with its own terrace. Would definitely tell anyone who will listen to stay here!,5,2011,06,09
14,Fantastic hotel & location,"Just left Barcelona & I would definitely stay there again. Very unique hotel in Gothic area. Great location, friendly staff, tasty breakfast. Room was large and very nicely decorated. Modern boutique.",5,2011,05,26
14,charming gothic hideaway..,"we have just returned from a 4 day trip to Barcelona,during which we spent our first night at the Neri hotel..we had decided before we went to split the nights and spend one in the Neri and one in the new Ohla hotel..what a mistake!!!!the Neri might be smaller and classed as one star lower on star ratings,but in every aspect for us it beat the ""soul less"" ohla hands down..from the moment we arrived we were greeted by the beauty of this wonderfull hotel and the enthusiasm and welcome of the receptionist of the day ""Mar"".she was so polite and corteous as she took a map and directed us as to how to get around the fab city of Barcelona..the hotel is filled with a beautiful energy,it's design is confident,warm and calming,a pure oasis in such a busy city..Mar showed us to our room,the beautiful junior suite(room302,if you are booking a jnr suite ask for this one)it doesn't have an outdoor seating area but as other reviewers have mentioned this means it has more indoor floor space.it also overlooks the magical little placa sant felip neri,with its tall trees and water fountain..the room itself is beautiful,complete with the most comfortable bed and a green velvet sofa,into which you sink in fluffy dressing gown and slippers,as you listen to your choice of music provided by the hotel..(2 little negatives are the lack of a kettle and ipod docking station,but its easy to get over these!!)as the photos show the bathrooms are slate,wonderfully equipped and though a little dark are again calming on the senses..the rooftop terrace is small but beautiful and as you sit among the rustle of the bamboo and the sent of jasmine it is so easy to unwind for awhile and foreget that you are in a busy city..we ate in the restaurant that night as we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday and though it is expensive it is a gastronomic treat!!again the staff,both the maitre di and the waiters were so attentive and completely unpretentious as they guided us through the unusual menu,the food just like the Neri itself was a treat to the senses..so if you are looking for a charming and unpretentious hideaway(yet right in the heart of the city!!)look no further than the Neri hotel..",5,2011,05,21
14,Outstanding hotel on every level,Ok so this is the first time I have written a review on here but thought I should after reading the previous reviews of hotel Neri. My girl friend and I have just returned from a long weekend there. I can honestly say this is the best hotel I have stayed in anywhere in the world. The location is perfect. Las ram las is only a five minute walk away the beach is about 15 minutes away and the cathedral and the shops etc are within about ten minutes. The service from the hotel is outstanding there was nothing that was too much trouble from arranging a restaraunt for us a taxi giving us directions or recommending places to visit. The rooms are fantastic. Clean modern very quiet and very big. You won't get this hotel for cheap but honestly its worth every penny,5,2011,05,16
14,Lovely hotel,"The Neri is well situated yet quiet. The staff were always courteous and helpful. The room( a junior suite) was very comfortable with comfortable bed, and some English speaking channels on the TV. Lovely fluffy towels and hot water was consistent.
The breakfast was fantastic. 
Overall the hotel staff went out of their way to make my stay very enjoyable.",5,2011,04,12
14,"Nice average hotel but not ""boutique""!","We booked this hotel through Mr & Mrs Smith Boutique hotels website and were frankly disappointed.  

When we arrived we checked in and just as we had completed this received a welcome glass of tea - not ideal as we were about to be shown round the hotel and to our room.  We had to carry it with us whilst we were shown round the hotel's facilities, though thankfully it was short.  Short and not very good; ""this is the library, over there the restaurant and now up in the lift to your room"".  

We also were also to receive a complimentary bottle of Cava and were asked what time we would like it to be brought to the room.  We asked for 5:00pm as it was only just before lunchtime when we arrived.  Unfortunately, this did not arrive at 5:00, or quarter past or half past and took 45 minutes despite asking where it was several times with no apology.  Why ask if you can't deliver at the agreed time?

We also reported a problem within the bathroom the first day, the sink had a leaking pipe which was causing the bathroom floor to fill with water.  They sent a maintenance man and one of the men from reception upstairs to have a look - whilst still waiting for the cava - and he told us that we had left the plug in the sink.  He told us that doing so meant all the water drained out too fast and thus the overflow on the floor.  When we told him we hadn't used the sink yet he told us we were wrong and this is definitely what had happened.  We were bemused by their explanation, they went away and promised to bring us more towels to replace the ones used to mop the floor up.  They also said they would look at it again the following day whilst we were out to check the pipe.  Despite several times reminding them that the pipe was leaking and asking them each morning could somebody please sort it out, when we left the hotel after a four night stay, the floor was still wet through.  We had to use all the towels placed in the room each day just to mop the floor.  

We asked for recommendations for eating and to have restaurant bookings made.  Each time we had assurances it would be done and a note would be left in our room to confirm but I'm afraid this didn't happen.  We just didn't feel confident anything we asked for would actually occur.  On the third night we asked if we could have a booking for the following day at a restaurant recommened on Trip Advisor called Dieux.  We asked again the next morning if the booking had been made and, after some scurrying around behind reception, we were told yes the booking had been made.  We tried to find the restaurant that afternoon on our way back but couldn't so asked at reception when we came back where was it.  We were then told that the restaurant no longer existed but a booking had been made at it's replacement restaurant.  We asked if this was a good restaurant to be told by the receptionist, no he had been there and did not think it  was very good!  We decided to ignore him and carry on with the booking.  As it turned out the restaurant wasn't very good on the service side but the food was very good.  

We also asked for the best way to get to Camp Nou (FC Barcelona).  We'd been there via a tourist bus throughout the day to collect some tickets for the match that evening and it was obviously somewhere where you should know how to get to with 82,000 people all wanting to get there.  We were advised to get a taxi!  When we queried the possibility of traffic and we would prefer the public transport options we were told buses go there (not which ones) and then to go a Metro station further away than the closest one.  When we got to the room to check it out there was a Metro on the correct line around the corner from the hotel, the one recommended would not have taken us to the stadium.  We ignored their advice.

On checking out we were told we had had water from the minibar, which we hadn't, not at euros 7.50 for a small bottle anyway!  Again that look of disbelief from the receptionist made us feel very uncomfortable, but he did remove the drinks in the end.  

Would we recommend this hotel to others?  Well the location is excellent for accessibility to shops, restaurants and transport.  The hotel is a lovely old building converted to a hotel.  Is it as special as people promote it to be?  No.  Is it worth the price per night? No.

The bathroom was dark (and in our case felt damp).
There was no fan in the bathroom.
The wall mounted light/mirror was falling off the wall, the plaster had given way.
The stone around the bath and shower looked nice but was completely impractical and we kept getting grazes from it.
The bedroom floors are wooden and look lovely but when you have someone walking in high heels across them above you it's very noisy.
The window to the balcony opened inwards and was difficult to negotiate around the furniture in the room.
The bedding was nice but nothing special.
The towels were not 'big and fluffy' as promoted.
The towelling robes felt thin and you felt like many people had been wearing them!
Free wi-fi - one of my pet hates here I'm afraid - it's there, it's for free but you need a password and username to get into it which no-one can supply and it's not in the hotel literature to just be able to log on.
The decor to the rooms look a little tired and it really shows in places.
The solarium was closed and the roof terrace may overlook the Gothic Quarter but you need to go to the edge and look down as from the terrace all you can see is people's rooftops and windows.  There were sunloungers but with no covers and we didn't seen any sign of the bar service. 

Barcelona itself was a surprise to us, we iked it very much.  We will be going back but we won't be staying here again.  Not worth the extra you pay I'm afraid!",3,2011,03,22
14,wonderful,"Stylish, friendly, great food, wonderful accomodation, fabulous location and for a first time in Barcelona could not have been better. We will definately return.",5,2011,02,25
14,"Great Spot, nice hotel, expensive add ons","the neri is a very nicely styled hotel in the centre of the gothic quarter... easy to find, just get the taxi to drop you at the nearby square and walk about 100m passed the cathedral and down a lane.  Rooms are expansive and well styled, and very clean... not sure about the bathroom though - it looks great with the stone etc but with no window and no extractor fan it is not a great functioning room.  Free wi fi is great.
Service is good but annoying little things like no tea and coffee in room, and expensive room service charges.  
there are some great cafes and restaurants nearby and all sights are close too.",4,2011,02,25
14,a sound choice,"every aspect of our two night stay was of good to excellent  quality, from arrival to departure, except for what I considered a disproportionate  price charged for two [simple] drinks from the bar.",4,2011,01,24
14,Rip off,"We had to cancel our trip to Bacelona 2 weeks ago because I got the flu. The airlines and all the other hotels gave us no problem. We contacted Neri several days before,through their website where it says ""Contact Us"". The day before we had been scheduled to check in, I had not heard back from them,and emailed them directly at -- and asked them to confirm they had received our cancellation. Nothing back. The day after we were scheduled to check in, I received an email saying they were charging me 245 Euros as a ""No Show"". Since then, I have called 5 times to try and resolve. Today I was told they are sticking with the charge,and that the ""Contact Us"" section on the website is only for comments,and not making or cancelling reservations. Would you want to stay at a place like that?",1,2011,01,17
14,Incredible luxurious romantic jewel boutique hotel in central Barcelona,"What a fabulous hotel! I would stay here anytime and wish this hotel were in every destination. Large sexy rooms with extremely comfortable beds, rustic modern design, stylish bathrooms with delicious smelling products, and a superb breakfast I will be craviof fresh breads of pastries with local meats, made to order organic eggs, fresh butter, olive oil and tomatoes, yogurts, coffee and teas. And a terrific staff always willing to arrange reservations, give directions, and assist in any way. The location is also superb, right in the center of Barri Gotic on a medeival alley behind the Cathedral of Barcelona.",5,2010,12,27
14,Sense of history with this location......,"Within the limitations of an historic building, the Neri Hotel offers guests a splendid stay. We loved being steps away from the Cathedral and the Barcelona City Museum. Far enough from the noise, but close enough to the sights, we very much enjoyed the location, despite an initial wrong turn in finding the hotel from the taxi drop at Place Sant Jaume.

The service was friendly and professional at the front desk, and when we had questions we found everyone to be very helpful. We did use room service, which was fast and efficient but since our room only had a tiny table suitable for 2 wine glasses we found we needed to use the table from the terrace. Had we been given a choice at check in (I forgot to ask) we would have opted for a larger room instead of the terrace. The front desk also arranged a taxi for us to the airport (door to door) which was only 35€ rather than the ""luxury shuttle"" which was very much appreciated.

On the whole the room was comfortable, but very dark unless the drapes were fully open on a sunny morning. A reading light by the chairs would help that. Our bathroom faced apartments across the narrow walkway, and our bathroom window could also be viewed from the square below. Without proper privacy blinds, this was not the ""sensuous"" experience advertised at the Neri but instead was rather disconcerting, particularly at night.

We waited to book breakfast upon arrival, as had been previously recommended, since the price was much better than when booking with the room. It was a fabulous breakfast, complete with hot choices like an omelette, and gave us a wonderful start to the day. The only complaint we had is the lounge area of the restaurant, steps away from the breakfast, was used as a smoking area. Perhaps that will change after January 2. We would hope so. 

While we enjoyed our stay, particularly the location, we might choose another hotel when visiting Barcelona again. But for a first visit, it was very enjoyable.",4,2010,11,11
14,"Well located, beautiful historic hotel",Nice little hotel with very friendly staff. It's small size means the staff are a little overworked but it isn't too noticable. Decoration is nice although contemporary and doesn't quite match the building snd location. Room was great and very quiet.,4,2010,11,03
14,Charming Hotel Centrally Located in the Barri Gotic,"We arrived about 10:00 a.m. at the Hotel Neri, delivered by an ingenious cab driver who had to back down the narrow street to the hotel entrance. We waited in the lobby about an hour before being shown to our room, with aplolgies for the delay. Our 2nd floor corner room was very comfortable, clean and the thick terry robes (an unexpected bonus!) were generously sized. Although there was a pretty constant stream of tourists walking along the street, we were never bothered by noise. We signed up for the breakfast and were very satisfied wih the value. The front desk gave us good suggestions for a tapas restaurant frequented by locals and a waterfront restaurant offering a delicious paella. We only stayed two nights but would return to this hotel without hesitation. We did have to walk our bags to the square near the hotel for our return cab ride, but it was the fault of a delivery truck that blocked the cab driver. If you are interested primarily in the Barri Gotic, this is the place to stay. And everything else is just a short cab drive away.",4,2010,08,29
14,Not The Best Location - Not For Solo Women Travelers,Hotel Neri is tucked inside an alley off two turns from a main square. It is dark and at night the shops around the hotel put their trash out which you'll be walking past after your struggle to find the better restaurants which are not located directly near the hotel.  One morning I was woken up by a couple having an argument in the apartment located at the same window level as my hotel room - this is a lower income area and the open windows of the tenants surrounding the hotel is not pretty in any way.  While the hotel does have good food and the service was OK I don't think it's worth the money.   I think the hotel has passed it's prime and the style just doesn't forgive a compromised location.,3,2010,07,22
14,"Perfect small hotel, lives up to expectations.","Unlike many, the Hotel Neri lived up to the beautiful photos on its website. Every inch of the place looks and feels fantastic. It's small enough to be intimate and characterful, but manages to provide the sort of 24-hour service you get at much bigger hotels. The staff were excellent and friendly, the breakfast amongst the best I've been served. Very comfortable bed too; we slept extremely well. The location is great - central yet quiet. Book taxis or private cars through reception (we went for their luxury car airport collection) and the drivers will get you right up to the door of the hotel - quite a feat in a big merc down medieval alleyways. 
Staying here for a couple of days we felt like super stars, considering which I think it's pretty reasonably priced.",5,2010,07,18
14,Quiet location & stylish hotel,"Nice quiet & convenient location. The room was comfortable & had a nice bathroom. Received a little haughty attitude when wanting to eat in the empty restaurant for dinner but breakfast was always a good experience. Staff generally helpful & efficient. Unfortunately, there was no in-room tea/coffee making facilities.",4,2010,05,20
14,Comfortable hideaway in the center of old town,"High end design with attention to detail and comfort.  Loved the granite walls in the bathroom and earth tone zen feel. 
No views to speak off from our junior suite but super quiet at night. 
Daytime there is noise from the kids in the nearby school but I much prefer that to car noise.
Housekeeping is exceptional.
If you want views go to the W for lunch but sleep at Neri and save some money. It's also quite central to everywhere though a little hard to find at first. 
Finally, the breakfasts are excellent in quality and presentation.",5,2010,04,24
14,"Perfectly located, peaceful and friendly","We stayed at this hotel for a special break as my partner had retired.  We had narrowed down our choice of hotels, and decided to take a chance on the Neri after some questionable reviews we'd read (and also, the hotel's own website is not very informative).

We arrived on a daytime flight and took the airport bus into Placa Catalunya and walked to the hotel from there.  For a 5 euro trip from the airport, the bus is great value - there seemed to be one running every 5 minutes from the airport, and the drivers didn't overfill the bus, leaving you plenty of room to travel in comfort.  It is relatively easy to find the hotel - we had a map at the back of our guide book - and that was sufficient to get there on foot without too much trouble, so if you are arriving in daylight hours, I would say that you can take the bus and walk without any trouble - we headed to the cathedral (signposted) and went wrong once, ending up in Jaume, but soon found our way back.

We were staying in a junior suite (room 305) on the 3rd floor, and the room was fantastic, although smaller than some I've stayed in, but you are in the centre of the city.  The best thing about the room is that it has a fantastic terrace, and so if the weather had been better, I would have felt tempted not to leave the hotel.

A couple of things - the room we had only had a shower rather than a full bath.  Sometimes on walking around the city all day, it would have been nice to get back and relax in a bath, and so that was a small disadvantage.  Secondly, the hotel advertise a breakfast for about 21 euros, but when we checked in, we were offered the breakfast for 16 euros - not sure whether this is standard occurence, but there didn't seem to be a penalty for booking the breakfast on arrival, and it might be worth waiting til check in to see if there is a deal on.

We were certainly a bit wary about the breakfast, as it is expensive (even at the reduced rate), but we thought that it was presented exquisitely and was just delicious - what a perfect start to the day!

We couldn't work out if there was anyone in the hotel as it was so quiet.  We sat in the library late one afternoon, when we returned - exhausted! - to the hotel, and it was a lovely place to sit and relax and there was no-one else around.

The staff was very helpful, recommending places to eat and things to do.  We had 5 wonderful days in the city, and it was lovely doing a city break in the week and not feeling that you had to cram everything into a weekend.

We particularly loved Park Guell and had a sunny afternoon walking and relaxing there.

We also had the chef's tasting menu at Moo restaurant in the Omm Hotel.  Just fantastic - we arrived at about 8.30pm for pre-dinner drinks, and didn't leave until after 1am ... good job we were on holiday (although the locals seemed to still be going strong at that time on a work night!!)

It's a very expensive city, but we thought it was worth paying extra to have a beautiful hotel to come back with space to chill out, and we couldn't have chosen better than the Neri.",5,2010,03,18
14,A hidden gem perfectly located in the heart of old Barcelona,"Getting to this hotel is half the fun.  As your cab winds thru old world alleys barely large enough to clear its rear view mirrors, you expect to see Humphrey Borgart or Sidney Greenstreet at any moment.  Once you make it through the hotel's simple entrance, you feel like you have been admitted to some romantic and exclusive club.  The public spaces are very cozy, and the staff is completely friendly and accomodating.  Make sure you do the ""standard"" breakfast tray in the dining room - the food is great and you could easily get through the whole day just on what they give you - if only you could stuff it all in.",4,2010,01,10
14,"Sophisticated,spartan & verging on pretentious, but with helpful staff and supremely comfortable beds.","Dinner in the hotel was expensive & pretentious. My beef arrived with 3 peas, a teaspoonful of supposed cauliflower mousse and a lump of well stewed leg muscle.
breakfast consists of a tray of food brought to your table. Ours was  obviously prepared the night before so that the 'fresh' fruit was tired. It wasn't magnificent and I would suggest that 1 breakfast is shared between two. Coffee was good and plentiful, and self-served.
The location is fantastic and there are much better restaurants all around.",3,2010,01,08
14,Oasis,"Situated in the middle of busy Barrio Gotico, designed into medieval palace, this hotel is an oasis for the senses. Absolutely fabulous rooms. very well equipped with all the latest tech gadgets, ooze style. Almost Venetian opulence forced into minimalistic regime, with lots of Buddhist/Asian accents :-) Also great food and silent, super-professional staff.
A real feast for the senses!",5,2010,01,07
14,"Beautiful, excellent, boutique hotel in gothic district","Misleading reviews on Tripadvisor.  We stayed at Regina Hotel for one night based on tripadvisor reviews.  The reviews are misleading and that hotel is terrible.  Not sure if it is a ""reveiwer"" distortion or tripadvisor lack some ethical controls of its website.  So, we transferred to Hotel Neri as the result of a recommendation of Frommer's travel.  Neri outstanding and is as much better then the tripadvisor ratings as is Regina is worse that tripadvisor ratings.....humpf.

Neri is elegant, deep in the Gothic district.  It is lovely, clean, distinguished and well kept.  It was a terrific experience.  5-star hotel or very close.  We would highly recommend it.  It is rather expensive at $300US per night or more.",5,2009,12,14
14,"Stunning hotel, great service & location but noisey","Stayed here for a few nights when we got married in Barcelona. Great city by all accounts, stunning hotel however was a bit noisy and difficult to get to in terms of luggage etc and we had a lot of that considering seen as we had a ot of bags.. The room was on the main street and it got a bit noisey so make sure you get a room at the back of the hotel. The food, service and room were faultless. An expensive outing all the same however truly a lovely experience and once in a lifetime treat for us.",4,2009,10,31
14,best hotel in Spain,"A beautifully appointed hotel with contemporary fittings right in the middle of the Old Town. The attentive service commenced before we had even entered the hotel lobby - we were unable to drive down the little laneway due to a truck blocking it when Edward from reception came and picked up our bags then drove with us to a couple of carparks to get the best deal for us as we were staying there 6 nights. The standard room which we had booked through Expedia was a bit small for that length of time and again Edward showed me several other rooms which were available and we upgraded to a junior suite for an extra 40 euros per night.

I must say that all rooms booked through Expedia in the 8 hotels that we stayed in Spain were well appointed and you were not lodging in some back room of a hotel - I would certainly book through them again.

Again Edward went out of his way to find us a top class restaurant one night for dinner as most of the top restaurants were closed for the month of August and he booked us into ABaC where the food was stunning and by far the best restaurant in Spain.

The hotel also has a fabulous restaurant for lunch and dinner and the biggest breakfast served to you which we found impossible to finish. It was fantastic after all the sightseeing to sit out the back in the little plaza and relax and have a drink or on the rooftop which was so private.

Do not miss entire streets of old Barcino with water and drainage systems, baths,homes, dye works and laundries which lie under the Museu d'Historiain Placa del Rei about 3 Minutes from the Neri hotel.

I would highly recommend this hotel for its location, attention to detail and attentiveness of staff both in the restaurant and reception. Edward is a real asset to this hotel.",5,2009,09,13
14,In the heart of the Barri Gothic,We were upgraded to a  Jr. Suite since it was our honeymoon and they had a bottle of Cava chilling for us.  Our room was clean. spacious and had a view of the courtyard and restaurant patio.  We did not experience any of the noise issues that some have mentioned.  The location was good and I loved that it was down a small untraveled narrow street.  Although some of the cab drivers do not know where they are going - be sure to print a map.  The rooftop patio is not as spectacular as the pictures.  You can only see anything if you are standing. The staff was very helpful with making dinner reservations and suggestions.  Overall a good experience.,5,2009,09,10
14,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Great boutique hotel.  Staff was very helpful and cheerful, rooms were clean and well appointed.  It is in Barri Gothic so once you walk out the door it is a very busy area but our room was very quiet.  Centrally located.",4,2009,08,24
14,Stunning-worth the $,"Loved this hotel.  We stayed here our last night in Barcelona and decided to splurge on a suite. It was so beautiful (and large). The bathroom is amazing, and the overall modern, yet soft decor was stunning. We also had drinks in the hotel bar which was very nice too. We've stayed all over the world at some of the best hotels (four seasons, ritz etc.) and I can say that we were very impressed with this gem.  Great location, good staff, beautiful decor.",5,2009,08,02
14,Luxurious but loud,"We had two beautiful rooms.  The decor is elegant and lush.  Our room was spotlessly clean and very well appointed.
Noise is an issue.  During our trip there was a drunk in the courtyard who yelled out periodically.  During the day the kids were quite loud as were the neighbors across the narrow street.
The service is great as is the food.",5,2009,07,17
14,Loved it but a couple of issues...,"This is a really nice hotel with tons of low key style. The service was without fault, in fact they seemed to bend over backwards to be of service to us the entire stay. The best thing about the hotel is the location, which is tucked away on a pedestrian street away from the frenetic energy in the Barcelona streets and it was a relief to come back to our room after a hectic day exploring the city. The room was very comfortable with great linens and bathroom lined with stone tiles that I loved. However, there are a couple of issues which I think are important to know. Firstly, although the hotel is on a nice little square, for every weekday that we were there the sound of children from the school there was really, really loud every day for most of the day. I don't mind some city or kids having fun type of noise, but it was pretty loud and our room was on the far side of the hotel away from the square. The other noise issue was that because of the contemporary decor, most of the surfaces in the hotel are hard (wood, stone, glass) and because there is a large atrium open between floors, there is noise from the other heavy wooden doors closing. It didn't ruin my stay, but it was loud. Another thing to be aware of is that we stayed in a Junior Suite, which was a really nice room but which was basically just a large room and in no way a suite. There was no separate area or bedroom, so calling it a suite is not accurate. There were two chairs and tiny end table in between, plus the bed. In fact, the closet storage was smallish and for a couple staying for a while with a lot of clothes or luggage, it would be a tight squeeze. I've experienced this before in Spanish hotels so I wasn't overly surprised, but I would've liked to know it in advance because I love a separate bedroom when we travel. I still enjoyed the room and liked the private deck, which was spacious if not private because of neighboring windows overlooking it. There were also a few small issues that I think a hotel of this caliber should not overlook, like peeling paint in the shower, as well as a shower fixture with a sprayer that would not turn off and sprayed all over during the shower.",4,2009,06,19
14,Neri - ok but noisy!,"Our stay at the Neri was a 40th birthday treat.  It was very understated and calm.  In a lovely part of the city and the location was a big bonus being able to visit all the sites on foot.  The staff were very helpful and did not bother you unless you needed them.  The breakfast was expensive but good.  We had a junior suite room on the 3rd floor.  It was very roomy with a nice bathroom.  The fluffy robes, towels and slippers were great.  The TV channels were limited for English speaking holidaymakers - the News!  The big downside was the noise.  There is no traffic adjoining but the room overlooked a square which was frequented by down and outs - their talking which echoed throughout the square was supplemented by the noise of guests arriving back to their rooms throughout the night.  The soundproof was non-existent.  Therefore very uninterrupted sleep was had!!! Hotel chosen to ensure that as much deprived parents of young children our break would allow a good nights sleep.   During our break, in the majority, the weather was raining and slightly cold.  Would hate to think what the noise would be in the nicer weather where you would want the windows open wide.  Charming hotel but noise would put us off returning.",3,2009,03,30
14,Fabulous!,"Spent four nights at the Neri. It was a last minute change from our planned stay at the Ritz Carlton. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, tranquil, spotless clean, and very well located in the heart of the old city. The rooms are large, have lots of nice features including original furninishings, large flat screen TV's, CD players, and the bathrooms are beyond cool. My only complaint was the school yard adjacent to the Neri, which made for noisy afternoons if you happened to be in the room, but most of the time we were not so not really a bother. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2009,03,03
14,Neri good,"A very slick Hotel in the Centre of the old city. An amazing feel. We had one of the rooms with a balcony, which had views over the city roof tops towards a lite church. While at the Neri we ate both breakfast and dinner, which were top. A cleaver layout to the menu giving you different options depending on your mood.",4,2009,01,05
14,Wonderful stay at The Neri Hotel,"We recently spent two nights at the Neri Hotel.  Everything about it was terrific.  The location is great - right in the middle of the Old Town and within walking distance of everything a visitor would want to see.  The room we were in was large, airy, bright and wonderfully appointed - bathroom was also large and beautifully appointed.  The Hotel has a lovely peaceful feel to it.  The staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful.  

The bedding was very comfortable and we enjoyed the big fluffy bathroom towels and robes.  

We did not eat breakfast there but did enjoy one dinner - very good food.",5,2008,10,22
14,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Neri to celebrate our anniversary.  We were generally very impressed.  The hotel is beautiful and the location in the Barri Gotic is perfect.  This was our first time in Barcelona and were very pleased that we decided to stay in the Barri Gotic rather than L'Eixample where a number of the other hotels we were considering were located.

The Neri staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and reservations.  The only service hiccup was the presence of a prior guest's dirty underwear and socks left over in the room when we checked in--slightly disgusting, but forgivable.

The primary--and maybe only--downside of the Neri is price.  It was expensive in both an absolute sense and relative to other hotels in its class.  However, it is difficult to evaluate relative value because the Neri is so unique.  Overall, we thought it was worth the splurge.",4,2008,10,18
14,Loved it,"Loved this hotel.  We had a junior suite on the 3rd floor.  Great in room breakfast.  Wonderful shower/bath.  We would stay in this charming off the beaten path hotel again any day.    You can negotiate rate directly with the hotel.  Loved the location and the charm.  If you go to Barcelona, stay here.  We finished our stay at the Hotel Arts after this, and it was average and cold at best.  Don't waste your time with the big hotels in BCN.

Concierge was great.  We had two absolutely amazing meals at Commerc 24 and Gresca.  Great lunch at Cuines Santa Caterina.  Great tapas at Tapac 24 and Cal Pep.  Not so memorable tapas at Taller de Tapas (don't go here).",5,2008,10,15
14,Probably The Most Charming Hotel!,"I am coming back to Neri next Nov. 24th and I just can´t wait. We stayed there time ago and I could say this is probably one of the nicest hotels we have ever been to (and we do love hotels). The setting is just perfect in the gothic areas at the most charming litlle street. People were amazing, so wellcoming. We felt just pampered. The room (what a room!). So well furnished, just the way I like it. The restaurant was nice, quiet and food just superior (great wine recommendation).

Just and plain: perfect!!!",5,2008,10,03
14,Extraordi-Neri,"It would be easy to run down a hotel when the whole of your visit to supposedly sunny Barcelona is blighted by incessant rain. However, it would be difficult to fault the Neri. The service was extremely friendly and the room was fantastic. Its location in the heart of the Barri Gotic is convenient for getting around and also for local bars and restaurants (the Cuines Santa Caterina is well worth a visit). The interior modernity of the hotel comes as a surprise when viewed from outside - it is a clever blend of old and new. Not that its the be-all of a holiday but the wi-fi service worked extremely well. Would definitely recommend.",5,2008,10,01
14,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic!","We travelled to  Barcelona to  celebrate our engagement.  Hotel Neri  was everything we wanted and so  much  more.  The service was brilliant, the staff couldnt help  us enough.  

We stayed in a standard room and it was massive witha huge bed and sitting area.  We were given a list of different types of bedding, so  if you fancied silk for example you could have it.  if you wished for a different style of pillow no  problem there was a choice for pillows too.

The bathroom was kitted out was lovely toileteries and had a wet room shower.

We didnt eat in the restaurant but ordered room service the first night as we arrived at 2.00am the food was delicious and reasonably priced. 

The hotels location is great on a quiet alley so extremely quiet.  it is however only minutes walk from the las rambles",5,2008,08,21
14,Gorgeous hotel centrally located in Barcelona,"The hotel is gorgeous and quite an experience. Our room was fresh, modern with a large bathroom and patio! We ended up just sitting on our patio during the afternoon siestas and love it. What a special place. I can't wait to go back. It's in the Gothic Quarter and within walking distance to everything you want to see. Easy access to the metro.",5,2008,08,20
14,Perfect for all,"Perfect in everyway - great location, private, secure, clean, attentive to details, good service, great breakfast, elegant, some rooms even have DVD players, gorgeous bathrooms, nothing could have been improved",5,2008,06,08
14,Fantastic boutique hotel,"We had a great stay at the Neri which has THE most central location in Barcelona,right in the centre of the Bari Gotic behind the (other) cathedral. We found the staff utterly charming and could not have bben more helpful. 
   The room was more than adequate altho' a slightly strange layout.All in all one of the best city centre hotels i have stayed in and very romantic too.
  I am not sure would stay there in the summer tho' as it may be better to stay near the beach.",5,2008,04,24
14,Loved the Hotel Neri!,"The Neri is a small, cool boutique hotel in a historic building nestled into Barcelona's Gothic Quarter (the Bari Gotiq). The decor, service and food are impeccable, and the location is outstanding - right in the middle of the medieval city and a quick walk to just about everything. Our room was quite comfortable and surprisingly quiet, overlooking a small public courtyard (with a sad history ... a bomb exploded there during the Spanish Civil War, killing a group of elementary school students. The elementary school is still there, still used as a school). The concierge went out of his way to help us organize tours, get tickets, and select restaurants. It was an outstanding experience.",5,2008,04,22
14,The Neri is elegant but over-priced,"The hotel is beautifully styled and in a superb location in the gothic quarter.  It is peaceful, has nice roof terrace and the service was helpful and polite.  We have stayed in many boutique hotels but this seemed hugely over-priced.  We had a small (but elegant) room, no bath only a shower and no balcony.  Annoying piped music throughout the hotel - at breakfast and on the roof terrace it was loud and the same chill-out CD playing for 4 days solid. Almost £40 for two to have breakfast! Barcelona was amazing though - we loved it.",3,2008,04,16
14,Fabulous boutique hotel -- misses the mark on service,"We spent three nights at the Neri in early September. What a nice surprise of a place as you enter from the Barri Gotic. Fabulous ambience, nice accomodations. (And believe it or not we had a brave cab driver who actually dropped us at the door!) Truly a special 'boutique hotel' but alas, I must nod in agreement with all those other reviewers who are criticizing the service. We prefer the boutique hotel experience because of the personalized attention and service one typically gets at hotels in this category.  

While the Neri tries to position itself as a boutique hotel, it really does disappoint on service. The staff, while eager to please, just doesn't have the training or experience. What a shame...would we stay again?...hmmm...tough one. We loved being in the Barri Gotic. We would definitely want to stay in that area again but the service at the Hotel Neri would have to really improve to win us back. 

My advice to those considering a stay at the Neri would be, if future reviews indicate that the service has improved and that management finally 'gets' what their shortcomings are, book at the Neri. If they get the service right, it would be a fabulous place to stay!",4,2007,11,17
14,Awful service!,"What a shame - this hotel has so much potential - superb location, very chic and stylish, and with some super design features. However, in common with so many of the comments I have now read below, we found the service to be shocking. This hotel simply cannot justify it's 4 star price tag when it employs 1 star staff. The staff in any hotel are what really make it and you can excuse all sorts of problems if they are dealt with efficiently and in the right way. But at this hotel they have no idea what the service industry is about and made our stay very difficult from start to finish. Don't touch this hotel with a bargepole - over-rated and overpriced.",1,2007,11,05
14,Very Hip,"Wow! In stark contrast to its medieval surroundings, the Neri Hotel is urban chic to the max. A taxi can take you only as far as the Placa St. Jaume in the heart of the Barri Gotic, and from there you have to walk a couple blocks through narrow cobblestone streets.  But
once they buzz you in and you pass through the huge glass door, it's designer all the way from the complimentary orange juice and grenadine drink they serve you at check-in, to the walls and furniture of the lobby, to the decor and lighting of the rooms, to the large flat-screen television, to the quarried stone bathroom with
the rain forest shower. The Neri captures perfectly the sense of style and design that is almost palpable throughout Barcelona. Huge rooms, perfect central location, first class amenities and service, it was hard to leave.",5,2007,10,15
14,A perfect hideaway,"Loved the neri.  From the scent of the lobby once you enter through sleek glass doors, the modern juxtaposed stylishly with the historical.  The rooms were gorgeous, we loved the attention paid to design and detail.  Loved the flat screen TV.  Loved the unique lighting in the bathroom.  Loved that the hotel was set in an oasis of calm amidst bustling Barcelona and yet centrally located.  Definitely great for loved-up couples looking for a dirty weekend getaway!",5,2007,10,10
14,very modern boutique hotel with minor problems,"The wife and I did a three day stay at the Hotel Neri at the very end of August, 2007.

A few days before you arrive at Neri, you'll receive an e-mail asking you for your preferences with pillow types (feather, foam, sponge, brick?) and sheet types (linen, cotton, satin), as well as if you need a transfer service from the airport (Neri's transfer service would be 50 Euros; a regular Barcelona taxi would be about 25 Euros, but you run the risk of the driver not knowing precisely where Neri or Sant Server street is, in which case you tell him Plaça de Sant Jaume).

Thankfully our driver knew where Sant Server street was and after dropping us off in the square, we walked up one street, made a left onto Sant Server (no sane driver should attempt to drive up Sant Server street, it's too narrow) and the hotel was right there.  

The first thing you might walk into when entering the building will be an aromatherapy wall.  It's strong!  When you sit at the reception desk, the receptionist will have welcome drinks (""sweet milk"", as in coconut milk?) brought out.  The check-in process was very individualized and pleasant.

Because the hotel was fully booked for the nights were there, the receptionist said we received an ""upgrade"" (we originally booked a deluxe room) to a Junior Suite.  From what I can tell, the sizes between the three different room types are really really close, the only difference might be that there's a few extra amenities from one room type to another, and our junior suite had an outside balcony with chairs, a table and a day bed.  Not worth the difference in price, in my opinion.  For example, the suite balcony would probably be most pleasant to use when the sun is going down or especially when the weather isn't blazing hot outside, but the table there is not even big or tall enough to properly balance a room service tray or more than a couple small plates.

Apparently the hotel is a renovated, centuries old mansion, but every single centimeter of the building seemed completely brand new and I couldn't find what I thought was an original brick or tile in the place.  When I stepped out onto the suite's balcony and looked at the overhanging roof, I recognized those as being somewhat aged.  Okay -- the renovation they did to the original building must've been incredibly thorough.  

For it's size, the room was very impressive, thoughtful, quiet and indeed very soothing.  Your keycard needs to be inserted into a slot near the door in order for the room's lights & A/C to turn on.  Tiny halogen lights on each side of our bed could be dimmed and controlled from either side.  

I liked the very slight ""rustic"" feel to the furniture.  

Entering the bathroom, our room had an immense mirror with lights behind it.  Other light switches turn on a heat lamp and a much brighter light.  The shower was encompassed on three sides by rock slabs and a full glass wall (no worries about spilling water all over the floor like in other European hotel bathrooms with puny glass panels only covering a little bit of a tub).

Two little bags on the sink contain pretty much anything you forgot to bring from home:  toothbrush & paste, comb, tissues, shower cap, makeup remover wipes, cotton buds & cotton puffs, razor & shaving creme.  There's lotion, shampoo and ""bath foam"" (shower gel, I guess... no bathtubs in this hotel) bottles as well.

Now a couple of unfortunate things.

The last night of our stay, we noticed tiny black bugs in our bed.  They were about the size of fleas but they didn't jump like fleas.  Nor did they bite.  I'm not sure what attracted them or what they were, but it added a wee bit of an ""ick"" factor to the stay.  

There is an incense burner with incense on a shelf next to the bed.  After I burned some incense the first night, housekeeping never swept up the ashes from the shelf that I probably should've cleaned up myself.  I still tipped the housekeeping staff, tho.

My wife wanted to try the restaurant for dinner but once we got a look at the menu on site, she said there appeared to be more menu items listed on the hotel's website than in the actual restaurant menu (it appeared that there were maybe four things listed under each category of ""fish"", ""meat"", ""starters"").  Nothing in the English menu sounded very appetizing, so we ended up not indulging with dinner at the hotel restaurant.

We did do a room service ""snack"" two nights (in place of dinner).  The Ham, Cheese & Asparagus sandwich was small but very delicious, and my wife very much liked the Boccanipio (sp?) cheese and dried tomato salad.  My next night's choice turned out a little strange because of an unfortunate English translation in the menu.  It listed ""tacos of bullock with potato foam"", but the actual item turned out to be beef skewers in a kind of potato soup.  Relatively tasty, but I would've chose differently had there been an accurate description.

Other reviewers note surly service.  I didn't get this perception at all.  Most every staff member I talked with seemed pretty friendly and helpful.  Only a couple requests got ignored or denied (e.g. we had to check out at 12 noon sharp, not 12:30 p.m.), but nothing too important or annoying.

As we left the hotel, we noticed that graffiti taggers had ""hit"" the Hotel Neri window on Sant Server street, as well as spray painting lots of other doors & buildings along the way back to the plaza.  We felt pretty safe walking around the area, other than that.

14,"Small, intimate, well located","Stayed at the Neri in April, and found the hotel to be very much as described elsewhere!  Situated down a small road close to the Gothic Cathedral, the Neri is fantastically well situated in the Gothic quarter, placing you very much in the centre of Barcelona, making it an excellent base for exploring.

The hotel is decorated in soft and plush fabrics, and the staff were all polite and helpful during our stay and when booking.  The hotel arranged tickets for a Barcelona football match in advance for us, with the tickets arriving at the hotel on the day of the game.  Our room was a Junior Suite, which was a reasonable size and and on the top floor.  Quiet in the evening, in the day you got noise from children playing in the square below, though don't let this put you off as it in no way intrudes. 

Be prepared to get lost in the Gothic quarter - it truly can be a maze until you get your bearings, but there's much to enjoy from getting a little lost, as there are shops, streets, markets, restaurants and cafes seemingly every way you turn.  We had the hotel arrange a car to pick us up from the airport.  On your first visit this is probably worthwhile - though be aware that this is just a normal black and yellow taxi that the hotel sends.  You'll be impressed by his ability to get the car down streets barely wider than the wing mirrors though!

All in all, the hotel meets expectations - it's clean, comfortable, stylish, and was a nice place to stay.  If I was returning to Barcelona, I would look at other hotels simply to give us a variety of experiences, but I would also recommend the Neri to others.  In summary - the Neri is good, but somehow falls short of being great!

14,"Fantastic Hotel, Fantastic Location","The Neri Hotel is in a fantastic location within the heart of the old Gothic section of Barcelona.  The hotel itself really is quite spectacular and has all the amenities that you would want, with the exception of a gym.  The staff is incredibliy friendly and helpful.  We found the restuarant at the hotel to have great food, but to be very over-priced, but since you are located so centrally, you can walk within 5 minutes to find a number of other great places to eat.  If you are looking for a funky, boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona, this is the one.  Note to travellers: we arrived as a large group and took three taxi's to the hotel and none of the taxi's knew exactly where the hotel was situated.  Print out directions before you go to help your taxi as the hotel is nestled within the old gothic section and can be VERY hard to find the first time around.

14,Perfect hideaway,"My husband and I booked two nights in Barcelona, away from our toddler, and this was the perfect hangout!

The hotel is hidden down the passages of the Gothic Quarter, but is within walking distance of anything you might want to do.

For us this was sleep...  which we managed... and go out late for some caipirinhas at Schilling and some fab tapas at Taller de Tapas...

Our room 303 was big with a balcony and large bathroom.  Couldn't falt it.  The staff, contrary to other reviews, were extremely helpful and the room service Classic Breakfast a must!!!

No pool - which would have been nice, but the quirkiness of the hotel makes up for it.  You are staying somewhere quite different and special...

14,Fantastic beautiful boutique hotel,"My fiance and I recently stayed at the Neri in a junior suite located on the third floor.  The quietness of the room was fantastic, the best 5 nights sleep we have had in ages.  We did not have a balcony but our room overlooked the square which was really lovely.  The housekeeping was excellent, the bed extremely comfortable and the fixtures and fittings really chic, we disagree with previous reviews of the furniture being Ikea ish.  The staff do not fawn all over you but when utilised were friendly and courteous.  They did book a table for us at a michelin starred restaurant at short notice.  It is a welcome respite from the heat entering the hotel as it is quite dark and very cool after being out in the heat.  There aren't lots of facilities in the hotel so if you want a swimming pool etc then this is the not the hotel for you but is is unique and in a fabulous location, the catedral literally up the road and it is fabulous staying in the gothic quarter.  It is really easy to get anywhere in Barcelona pretty much from here.  Did not eat in the hotel restaurant but it does have a very good reputation and there is a fabulous little place called buenos migas not far from the hotel that does amazing foccacias and yoghurt with fruit for breakfast costing about 9 euros for 2 with coffee.  Barcelona is an amazing city and my fiance and I could easily have stayed for longer and felt relaxed after staying at the Neri would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants something that little bit different.

14,Great boutique hotel in central location,"We were delighted with this hotel.  If you like intimate hotels with strong contemporary design, this is the one for you.

The location couldn't be better.  It's in the middle of the Barrio Gothic right by the cathedral.  Plenty of places to eat out within easy walking distance.

Contrary to the reviewers below, we found the service excellent.  The staff are young, keen to please and they all spoke very good English.  They responded quickly to anything we asked for.

We booked a junior suite on the third floor with a terrace.  We couldn't fault the design of the room- spacious, good lighting, large bed, flat screen TV, DVD and CD player.  Good size bathroom with a tub plus shower.

Some of the reviewers below have complained about noise, but we asked for and got a quiet room which didn't overlook the children's play area.

The bar on the roof terrace is a bit of a let down and was empty when we went up there.  It isn't really a bar, as you phone down for drinks to be brought up to you.  Not much of a view either.

Breakfast was spot on.  We didn't try the restaurant as it has no choices for vegetarians, but we ate really well at Tragaluz, Cuines Santa Caterina and Agua which all had good veggie selections.

We would definitely stay at the Neri again.

14,"bad service, great location","The good news, this location can't be beat, it's in the middle of everything you would want to see or do in Barcelona.

The bad news - the service is HORRIBLE. We travel frequently and stay in many differnent types of properties. This was hands down the worst service I've ever gotten at a hotel (regardless of price). I am not a fussy traveler and usually don't need anything from my hotel staff.

This staff, however goes out of their way to make you feel unwelcome.
Their attitude is only matched by their incompetence. We booked 3 months in advance a junior suite. We were given a standard room, without a word. Like we wouldnt notice the difference! Unbelievable! 
We complained, and after much rangling (and tons of attitude) were given a suite after agreeing to pay a lot more (and waiting a full day). It was huge and beautiful (#106), but very loud and dark. Knowing that we wouldn't be able to handle switching again, we put in earplugs and made the best of it. 

They refused to exchange travellers checks (in euros) and on top of it, didn't know where to change money. Upon our late arrival the restaurant they sent us to was closed, and the requested wake-up calls never happened. They are a disaster. 

The hotel itself is beautiful, but the staff has got to go. I can't believe the owner puts up with this.",2,2007,05,20
14,Neri has spoilt,"It has been the third time i was staying at this hotel. It used to be my favourite in the world, but things went wrong this time.

We have booked juniour suite with the terrace, top floor, quiet, far away from elevator. Let me say it appears that they have 3 junior rooms, and believe me, they are far from been the same. The one we were given was resembling more a deluxe room only with a high celing, and this for 406 euros per night (incl taxes). I felt so crooked/ I reserved 6 weeks in advance, but obviously they messed my reservation.

It was never like that before, i was staying here in great rooms with nice small balconies, cozy and intimate. I was almost speachless once I saw in which room I had to stay this time. And have communicated before with a hotel about my reservation.

In the end they gave us a discount on the room, and next day we could move to a different room. But only after we complained 2 times. This so much spoilt my perfect Barcelona dream hotel.

I still find the hotel itself very unique. And they have actually lowered the price for breakfast which is worth every euro. 

But it seems to me that there obvious problems with stuff. It is still the same people at reception who used to work there 3 years ago, and they definitely feel demotivated. I do not see any longer sparkling in their eyes. I think some kind of rotation must take place. 

Otherwise I will definitely return again trying my luck.

14,Can do better...,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Neri in April 2007. We discussed and agreed on the following:

1) Location: right smack in the middle of the gothic maze, thus very close to many restaurants and sites. Would have been difficult to find, but the hotel arranged for transportation right to the door which was convenient (we recommend this, only costs a bit more than using a taxi). If safety is on your mind, generally this is a safe area. However, we were the vicitim of a purse snatcher...which we were told is common in these winding streets. Just leave your stuff in the safe box and all should be fine. You would be hanging out in these streets whether you were staying at the Neri anyway, thus don't let this be a determining factor in your decision.

2) Facilities: really, there isn't much in this regard. There is a sleepy restuarant and a roof top with chairs, but no real bar scene or service for that matter...def not a place you want to be hanging out...boring. Internet access in the ""library"" but what hotel for over $350 bucks a night doesn't have this?

3) Rooms: very cool intereior, mix of dark ""cave like"" stone and soft colors made for a comfortable, modern, room. Flat screen TV, but like the rest of the hotels in spain, I hope you like CNN. Shower was nice, but I have no clue why they made the room so dark...honestly, you can barely see to shave, put on make-up, etc...its sort of strange. The bed was very comfortable and the climate controls worked to perfection.

4) Service: indifferent at best. Odd to me, but I felt at times like my being at the hotel was an inconvenience. There is no real doorman, just people wondering around. Upon arrival, we were asked just to leave our bags in the lobby and walk around as the room wasn't ready (which is fine), but as we were leaving I swear our bags were just left and there wasn't a single person left to look over them, move them, or whatever. Don't expect anything from anyone. This crowd doesn't bother you, they just don't want you to ""bother"" them.

5) Noise: as noted by other reviewers, these rooms are really noisy. Some of it comes from school kids during the day (we really didn't care about this because we were out playing in the City). But late at night, or in the morning, footsteps could be heard, voices, etc. Not sure where it originates from, but it was loud and clear.

Overall, we enjoyed Barcelona, but you can do better for a place to stay. I think any ""buzz"" over the Neri is withering away (if it's not gone already), and it is enjoying its final gasps of popularity. Even the staff seems to be growing bored.

14,"lovely hotel, but","Due to a mix-up by a booking agency, 4 extra rooms were booked in our
name. Instead of the hotel staff sorting this with the agency, they expected us to sort in the middle of our holiday. They even suggested
we may have to pay 5 x over! Eventually it was sorted, but the hotel staff offered no formal apology or compensation. Sleepless night and stress do not make for a good holiday. Could not recommend the hotel as the staff did not deal correctly and professionally with this problem

14,Great Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Neri in Nov. 2006. The hotel is beautiful and the staff could not have been more helpful. The hotel is in a perfect location in the Barri Gothic. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and I loved the mood lighting. I highly recommend this hotel.
",5,2007,04,17
14,Great place shame about the staff,"We spent three nights there in April. The hotel location and rooms are great, but the staff attitudes let the hotel down. I've been lucky enough to stay in some great hotels over the years, and they've all had the same thing, great staff! Not something that I would say about the Neri, although there were some exceptions. Breakfast service was offhand to say the least, a second cup of coffee was a bit of an effort for our waitress. Roof terrace is lovely, rooms and bathrooms are great, our room service dinner was expensive and very poor. Some great restaurants around, try Pla, fabulous setting, food and staff! The Neri could take some lessons
",3,2007,04,16
14,"totally ""underwhelmed""","Having read the reviews on trip advisor we decided to treat ourselves to a special hotel. Given the price we were paying (even booking last minute) we had high expectations of the Neri. 
The hotels location is excellent although we do agree with other reviewers it is a little hard to find. Although the building is architecturally very interesting the interior is somewhat lacking. We found the reception staff to be aloof and uninterested. 
Our room was okay but nothing special. Some of the furniture even looked like it had been knocked together at ikea! On a plus point the bed was huge and very comfy.
The bathroom was on the small side and for the price and style of hotel we  would have expected a walk in shower - not a badly designed shower over a spongy bath that leaked onto the floor. 
As advertised in the room we decided to have a drink on the roof terrace. Orders had to be placed by telephone, there was no menu and the staff taking the call were very unhelpful. The waitress who brought the drinks up was very unfriendly as if she resented having to bring drinks to the fourth floor!
The electricity kept going off in our room and we had to ring reception to have it switched back on. When we mentioned this again on check out the receptionist said ""oh"" and continued with her paper work.
We did not eat in the restaurant or have breakfast at the hotel 
( 25 - 84 euros per person !)
The hotel is just ""okay"". We do not feel it is anything special and definitely not worth the money they are charging. Maybe six  years ago it was seen as something different in Barcelona but other hotels have caught up and over taken the Neri. It is tired and over priced. Friends we were with stayed at the Camper which seemed much better value all round.
",3,2007,03,10
14,Romantic and stylish stay,"Like many other hotels in Spain, this hotel was accommodated in an old building.  It was a lovely small hotel.  We stayed three nights there, two nights in a junior suite and one night in a standard room.  Originally we planned to stay all the three nights in the junior suite but it was already full for the final night when I made the reservation (almost one month ahead already).  So, make the reservation earlier.

Location
The hotel was situated in the heart of the Barri Gotic.  Very close to the plaza (within 2 mins walk) where the Correfoc and the Castellers show were during the biannual festival.  The hotel was not located right on the major road, not easy to find.  Ask the hotel to pick you up at the plaza or the metro station.

Room
Both the standar room and the junior suite were fantastic.  Tastefully appointed, plasma TV, beautiful and good quality toiletries, mood lighting......  All made you feel being pampered.  I really liked the room and the bathroom.  It was not difficult to note that they used high quality materials / accessories to decorate the room.  Worth the little extra for the junior suite.  If you can't book a suite, a standard room is still good enough.

Service
Warm and friendly.  We were taken care of all the time by the staff.  They offered a welcome drink made from rose petals, it was romatic but tasted a bit strange (like drinking liquid soap).  Nothing was too much trouble.  Similing face on every staff.

Food
We tried a breakfast there.  Lots of food and presented in a special way.  Not good value but worth a try.  It was a playful experience.

Facilities
This was the weakest aspect of the hotel if you compared it with big five star hotels.  There was a small library on the G/F and bikes for rental.  

I like this hotel very much.  It was my favorite in my whole journey in Spain.  It was a lovely and stylish boutique hotel embraced with culture and history.

",5,2006,11,23
14,Starkly elegant,"Ultra modern juxtaposed with the 18th century made this hotel unique and memorable. The location is fabulous, the staff helpful and friendly. Language is a non issue. Our room was starkly elegant with neutral grays and browns accented by sharp colors in the painting, which hung over the bed. A dimmer switch controls ambient lighting. The bath was stunning and had all the toiletries anyone could need, including a sample of Armani perfume. Internet access is “on the house”. Simply ask for a cable.

To avoid the hassle of schlepping luggage through the cobbled streets of Barri Gothic, ask the hotel to arrange transportation. As a rule cabs are not allowed on the pedestrian streets of the old city. To break the traffic rules, the cab drivers will add 30-40 Euro to the fare. We felt the convenience well worth it. 

Although we did not partake in the hotel’s evening dinner, we did indulge in the breakfast on our final morning. They call it a personal buffet. We sat down in the restaurant and waited several minutes. Never saying a word or acknowledging our presence, the waitress brought out a Japaneese style tray filled with food. Expensive, unique and filling, it consisted of freshly squeezed Valencia orange juice, assorted hams, fresh fruits (some of which I had never before seen), coffee, cereals and pastries.
",5,2006,10,28
14,Can't fault the Neri,"We stayed here for two nights during a 9 day journey from England through France to a villa in Spain and this hotel was the most luxurious of all.  The only downside was that we arrived by car and as the hotel is in a pedestrianised area almost next to the old Cathederal in the Barri Gotic, we had to park in the public carpark in Placa D'Antoni Maura and haul or luggage to the hotel.  It was worth it!
The hotel is housed in an historic building but is sympathetically modernised to a wonderful degree.  The bedrooms are very well equipped, elegantly decorated and artistically lit.  Our well proportioned bathroom had rough granite tiling, a good bath and shower, a heated mirror to prevent misting and excellent lighting.
We did not eat in the restaurant in the evenings as we were with vegetarian friends and the menu didn't appear very veggie friendly but the breakfasts were outstanding. There were excellent choices for all including a tray of fresh fruits, breads, yoghurt, meusli, cheese and hams and the additional option to order eggs of any description plus bacon and sausage.  A breakfast here can truly last all day!
If we go back to Barcelona (and it is always worth an additional visit) we will definitely stay here.",5,2006,10,09
14,Fantastic Hotel,"This was our second stay in Barcelona and the fact that we enjoyed it so much more this time was largely due to this hotel.  It is in a superb location, the suite was fabulous and the service and food first rate.  The hotel has a very chilled atmosphere balanced with impeccable facilities and staff.  The decor is gorgeous and the fact that there are only 22 rooms makes for an intimate and relaxing experience.  We can't wait to return.
",5,2006,10,03
14,Romantic Gothic Hideaway,"Hotel Neri is gorgeous! It's tucked away in the gothic quarter and is an oasis of luxurious calm.  This is the perfect hotel for a romantic stay in a fantastic city.  The location is superb. 
Have dinner in the hotel restaurant at least once, the food is delicious.  The breakfasts are amazing, try the french toast. 
I loved everything about the hotel!
",5,2006,09,20
14,"Cool, chic design hotel","Just spent 4 days at the Neri to kick off a 2-week trip to Spain.  I booked it after doing an exhaustive search of Barcelona's high-end hotels, and I was very happy with the outcome.

The Neri is fantastically located just a block from the Cathedral and is a 5-minute walk from the trendy Born area and its tapas restaurants.  Anyone going, though, should arrive armed with a good map--not the one from the Neri's website--because taxi drivers have no idea where the hotel is and don't even realize you can drive in what many think is an exclusively pedestrian zone.  So we found ourselves hoofing it for a few minutes, asking for directions from passers-by, until finally finding success.  Once you know where you are, however, it's no problem since you can just ask for Placa Catedral, which is only a couple minutes on foot.

The hotel is an expert renovation of an old Gothic mansion, really stylish and design-forward.  The commons areas are warm, chic, inviting.  The rooms are a bit cramped, but impeccably done, so that didn't bother us.  The bathrooms, done in granite blocks evocative of the Gothic walls outside, are fabulous--and come with excellent products.

We only had breakfast at the hotel--good but expensive.

The staff is attentive but largely uninterested, as mentioned by another reviewer.  They are willing to help if asked, but certainly don't strive to go beyond the minimum.  If you're independent like us, and can laugh it off that the staff is too trendy for their own good, you'll be fine.  If you need to stay somewhere where you feel like the staff are your best friends, then you won't be happy with the service.

 I did visit a friend at the Hotel Arts--one of the biggest and most expensive hotels in town--on the last night of our stay.  And while the Arts is certainly luxurious and somewhat cool, it comes nowhere near the style and personality that the Neri boasts.
",5,2006,09,08
14,Wow!,"We spent four nights at the Neri at the end of August  beginning of September.
When we arrived at the airport, we had to help our taxi driver to find the best place to drop us off. We had about a 2 minute walk to get to the hotel. 

We arrived a little hot and flustered after getting a bit lost but were welcomed with drinks and very efficient friendly staff.

As it was our anniversary we found a bottle of Cava in our room which was most welcome. The rooms are really modern with fantastic granite bathrooms, cool lighting and very clean

The restaurant at the Neri, though expensive is very good quality, but plenty of restaurants to choose from nearby.

The location is the best thing about this hotel. Totally central and surrounded by narrow streets, tiny squares with fountains and a cathedral.

We loved this place and would say this is probably the best hotel to stay in if visiting Barcelona, mainly for location but also it is genuinely  a beautiful hotel
",5,2006,09,05
14,Nice but . . .,"A stunning and unique property. Very well appointed rooms and bathrooms with excellent detail. 

However.

Our room was at the back of the hotel and faced a charming courtyard . . . which filled with children several times a day. Sometimes the racket of kids laughing and playing was nice, sometimes it was a bother.

We went there on our honeymoon for some pampering before a trip to the countryside in France. We were not pampered. The hotel is wonderful, but we felt pretty disposable. The staff was always courteous and professional, but the personal touch was totally lacking. Of course, no one felt as special about our wedding as we did, but we had hoped for something more than nice digs.

The hotel is located in the old quarter. The narrow streets are not very well lit at night and can seem very seedy and not so safe. We never felt in danger, but unless you're used to walking down very narrow streets with moderate to poor lighting and the sound of drunken revelry around many corners, this neighborhood might feel a little sketchy.
",4,2006,08,13
14,Stunning and unique hotel!,"My other half booked this on the sly having seen it in the Mr & Mrs Smith guide, as he was looking for somewhere a bit different to propose.  The Neri didn't disappoint, we had a lovely suite overlooking a quiet little square next to the Cathedral.  The hotel was very cool, full of beautiful people and we were spoilt rotten for the 3 nights we were there. 

Would definitely recommend the Neri for a special occasion as it is a bit on the expensive side - the huge room service breakfast brought to you at 11.00 am is the height of decadence! 

We will be back...
",5,2006,07,27
14,Very charming  and stylish hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Neri for 3 nights - and loved it.  Wonderful , helpful  staff , lovely rooms  and an outstanding  terrace .  Very nice bathroom amenities and  super linens-a choice of satin, cotton or linen.   The room was beautifully appointed although just a little bit dark.  A large mirror in the bedroom would be helpful.  Otherwise, a  perfect  hotel-we'll be back and will  recommend it hightly.
",5,2006,05,25
14,great Hotel,"I booked this hotel for my wife’s 40th birthday. This hotel was one of the best I have ever stayed in. The service was second to the none and the hotel was excellently located in the old Bari Gothic district.

The general decoration of the hotel and rooms was impressive to say the least. 
The hotel even e-mail you for your choice of music and bed linen upon arrival in your room! 

If travelling by taxi from the airport use any of the well marked yellow cabs outside as this only costs about 22 euros and is no more than about 20 mins journey depending on traffic.
",5,2006,03,23
14,A liitle extra but worth it!,"The reviews for the Neri are generally very favourable and this is why we chose to stay there. They were very helpful booking the taxis to and from the hotel, (50 euro's if you want to go direct to the door as streets are VERY narrow).
The room was small but lovely AND very, very clean. We ate in the resteraunt twice, once at the last minute due to an upset elswhere. The food was excellent, even when my daughter sent the food back twice as she only wanted her food steamed, with no dressing what so ever, they remained polite and did everything to please her. Service above and beyound the call of duty. (Breakfasts were overwhelming, 1 could be shared between 2)
We found all the staff very kind and helpful, particularly when I had an accident, it happened away from the hotel but they still gave me brilliat first aid!
I am not easily impressed, or easily pleased, but I do think the Neri desrves an above average rating. IF things upset you talk to them, I have no doubt they will help if it is at all possible. Just remember, the impossible may take a little longer.
",4,2006,03,19
14,Barcelona's Hidden Gem,"Having visited Barcelona many times I can safely say that Hotel Neri is the best
hotel I have stayed in.

The only downside is that it is quite difficult to find first time around. I took a taxi from the Airport and the driver was unsure as to the location of the Neri as it is tucked away up a pedestrianised street.

Having said that, the quiet location somehow adds to it's charm and Clientele such as David Bowie and Lou Reed (check the guest book) have used this to their advantage.

The hotel is built from stone and is very dark but somehow the lighting and super cool decor gives it a warm and calming atmosphere. The rooms are excellent, very nicely lit and equipped with everything you could possibly need including some very nice Etro toiletries.

I'm not sure about the dining at Hotel Neri as I didn't eat dinner there and rushed out before breakfast. The staff, who spoke excellent English were courteous without making a huge fuss but were happy to help when needed.

Hotel Neri is a design hotel but it is much better and cheaper than similar hotels I have stayed in I would definitely recommend the Neri to both couples and business travellers.
",5,2006,01,23
14,Poor Service betrays an otherwise good hotel,"My wife and I visited Neri Hotel for New Year. We booked a Junior Suite for two nights and chose Neri over Arts, due to its proximity to the New Year celebrations and after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor.

The majority of reviews are accurate when discussing the location (which is excellent) and the decor/ambiance (which, again, was very pleasant). The rooms are well designed. They are rather more modern than the surroundings of the Gothic quarter, but we knew that. Comfortable beds and a stylish bathroom created a relaxing environment.

So what was the problem? Well, for a four star hotel that charges me EUR 332 for a night, I expect a lot more. It was difficult for us not to compare with Santa Mauro in Madrid, where we had stayed a month before, for the same price and which oozed efficiency and courtesy. Neri was nothing on this, or indeed many other hotels we have stayed in (particularly those that charge the same prices).

We arrived at 23.30 after a late flight from London. The hotel knew that this would be our arrival time (and as it was Friday evening, I would imagine the hotel has had experience of many people taking a flight after work to spend the weekend in Barcelona). There was one person manning the front desk and no other staff (whether porter or receptionist or indeed anybody else) were available. And so, we were not shown to our room, and carried our own bags there. We were not shown how to operate the TV or the Aircon or shown where the well-hidden mini bar was (we now know) or even offered a newspaper for the following morning or told that we could order breakfast for our room by filling in a form and placing it on the door. As a perennial back-pain sufferer, I was pleased to see I could get a firm pillow, but displeased to find out that I could not do so after 9pm as house-keeping was closed (despite the information in our room proudly advertising the fact that a range of pillows was available)! Then we found out the TV didn't actually work.

The next day, when we mentioned all of this to the supervisor, she could not have looked more disinterested or acted more discourteously if she tried (the manager was only available from Monday - Friday, and was not around at weekends.

This was a shame, for Barcelona is a wonderful city, the hotel is a fabulous building in an excellent location and the staff (with the exception of the supervisor) were very friendly and welcoming, although rather stretched. But if a hotel expects to compete with others in the top end of the market, it needs to consider the bigger picture. Service sets one hotel apart from other hotels, which is why the Neri failed to justify its expensive room rates and why next time I am Barca, I will stay at the Arts.
",3,2006,01,03
14,Clone the Neri,"I just spent three nights at the Neri and came away overwhelmed by its minimalist elegance and utterly wonderful ambience.  The room was delightful (we had a superior double) with your choice of music, bed linens, and newspapers.  Those who find it difficult to find are a bit dim as the hotel is located right next to the Cathedral of Barcelona which is a rather simple landmark.  Since the hotel is in a pedestrian zone, the noise levels were minimal and the hotel staff is utterly accomodating.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough...I wish there were Neris everywhere I travelled.
",5,2005,12,21
14,Very stylish hotel,"Very stylish hotel
I liked all. Unique lack - necessity in advance for a day to enter the name for a supper, that we forgot to make. The suite is especially good.

",5,2005,12,10
14,excellent Neri,"Stayed there in November 2005. Superior room 203. Very atmospheric - different but good. Own LCD TV,CD player (borrow CDs from reception), decor and comfort superb, breakfasts bit expensive at 18 euro but good. Not all taximen can find. Watch pickpockets around Cathedral.
",5,2005,11,30
14,Lovely hotel. shame about the twin bed.,"Had heard about the hotel through a friend living in the city. Taxi driver wasn't exactly sure where it was but 20 minutes later we found it. A lovely place down a little side street. The hotel is everything you could want. Beautiful surroundings, great feel to the place, everything was perfect except our 'double bed' room turned out to be a twin bed stuck badly together (something not uncommon in spain, but this was badly stuck together!). Upon requesting a change of bed they showed us the only other room available which had a regular double bed. But alas this room was nothing compared to our orginal (which had lovely views of the coutyard). 

So if you decide to stay; room 202 has lovely views of the courtyard, just request a regular double bed!
",4,2005,11,30
14,A Mixed-Bag,"The Hotel Neri is both a wonderful place to stay and somewhat problematic.  Getting there can be a challenge so have the hotel arrange for your transporation when you arrive at the airport.  The staff is very friendly and will try to do whatever they can to make your stay pleasant.  Everyone was warm, friendly and helpful.  Breakfast in the dining room was frustrating...it was under-staffed and took way too long.  Also, the waiter did not have a good command of English so exchanging basic information was difficult.  

The hotel decor is fascinating.  All very minimalist and modern with some unusal twists and turns.  The room is relaxing and attractive.  Just remember to bring a flashlight and ear plus.  The lighting is dramatic and creates a wonderful atmosphere, however you can't read on the sofa because there is only ""mood lighting"".  Right outside our window was a delightful courtyard belonging to a school.  While all of the children were adorable I must warn you they are children and they make a lot of noise.  Not just in the morning, but all day long.  So bring ear plugs, or plan to get up early and stay out all day if you are looking for quiet.
I suppose I would choose it again because it was such a kick and it's in a great location.
",4,2005,11,20
14,Great hotel.Pity about the breakfast service!,"We enjoyed our three nights at the Neri apart from breakfast.
The service in the dining room on the first morning was poor despite only eight people being in the dining room.We had to ask for refills of tea or coffee when we managed to attract the attention of the two members of staff. We realised after the first morning that you had to make a point of asking for the cooked breakfast on the first encounter with a member of staff. We cancelled our evening meal which we had booked for the Saturday evening because of the offhand service at breakfast.
",4,2005,11,13
14,I'm in heaven...,"We have just been staying at the Hotel Neri for five nights. And I must say - this hotel impressed me big time! The atmosphere and the staff is just beyond anything I have ever experienced.

If you are looking for a romantic hotel in Barcelona, the Hotel Neri is the only place to stay. It's expensive but worth every penny. This is not ""nice"" to visit, but ""need"" to visit.
",5,2005,10,29
14,Unique Experience,"This hotel came recommended by our friend who lives in Barcelona.

We spent one night at the Neri and we are so glad we did. It was so beautiful inside the lobby and our room was artistically decorated. The interior of the room was masculine, so men like it, but also elegant for the women. There was stone and wood throughout the room and unique lighting which made the room warm and cozy. The bed linens are the best and you have five choices of sheet types (silk, linen, etc). We met some people in the bar and the bartender was friendly. It was the first time we spoke English in 10 days so it was like an oasis. We ate some tapas at the bar which were excellent. The only thing to be aware of is that it can be difficult to find this oasis. We were too tired to really be able to clearly follow a map to the hotel. There needs to be some signage in the area. Not the fault of Neri Hotel. Once we got there we cared less about how long it took us to find it.

This is a unique experience you must try.",5,2005,09,20
14,Fabulous!,"We stayed at the Neri for five nights in September with a group of 12 other friends. The hotel was terrific. The location was perfect and Sant Felipi Square was beautiful. Though there was some noise from the square, it was easily remedied by shutting our windows each night. The rooms were spacious and modern and every member of our group was very happy with the accommodations. A few people stated it was the best hotel they had ever stayed in! The hotel staff in particular was fabulous and extremely patient and gracious--making reservations, assisting with a scavenger hunt, and helping individuals on matters like internet access, finding our tour bus driver for a wine tour, arranging taxi's for large groups, a wine party in the library, and taking group photos. We couldn’t have been happier and will always choose this hotel in Barcelona.
",5,2005,09,20
14,Beware,"We would be writing a review of this hotel had they not TOTALLY screwed up our reservations for two rooms. The only way we discovered this error was by dropping by the Neri 2 weeks before our planned visit (we were staying at the wonderful Casa Camper in July 2005) and having been urged to also try the Neri by friends in Barcelona we had made reservations there for our return to Barcelona in early August.  In any event, during our little visit to the Neri we were told that they had lost our reservations despite the fact that we had the confirming emails with us and had exchanged multiple emails with the staff.  The most appalling thing was that the hotel offered us nothing! Not even an apology.  They just said: sorry we're full and don't know how this happened....  This does make one wonder about this hotel. 
We returned in August 05 instead to the Casa Camper which we love and can highly recommend.",2,2005,09,03
14,A few missing facts -,"I'll not repeat the majority of what has been said, its a great place and without any doubt better than any other hotel in Barca.

Ideal for romantics but NOT under 12's, even though they will add an extra bed for 50Euros a night.

Just a few ""adds"".

It is VERY VERY difficult to locate, we were there for 2 nights and got lost every time we ventured out - and even the owner of the bar in the next alley way didn't know where they were!!!

Book a superior room - they have a safe + they face the square and not the adjacent apartments.

Don't expect a scenic view from any window though!

Breakfast is expensive at 18Euros ...BUT...like the place itself its an experience, don't miss it out!

Barca is, contrary to popular opinion, a safe place if you take care and be sensible.

Sadly the square behind the hotel is very peaceful, so it attracts some vagrants, we counted 5 one evening-  who enjoy the delights of sleeping on cardboard in the corners.

They aren't agressive, they just want to sleep- but it does take the gloss off you enjoying the opulence from within- guilt maybe??????

They can't get rid of them as the police say they aren't breaking the law.

Restaurants start serving at 9pm onwards- plenty to choose from.
PLA, which is just around the corner from Neri is ideal if you don't want to walk too far- good food as well.

The Neri is not cheap - but for a short stay its well worth it.
Not just a place to stay but an experience - much enhanced if you like the smell of joss sticks ,  being attended to by ""beautiful people"" and appreciate detail - such as the condoms in the mini bar - honest!!! :)
",5,2005,08,25
14,Wouldn't Stay Anywhere Else!,"Spent five nights in the Neri before a cruise, and loved every minute of it.  The rooms are beautiful, with plasma TV, CD player, dimmers on all the lighting, exquisitely comfortable beds, and the most wonderful bathroom to be found in any hotel anywhere!

The staff was gracious and accommodating, catering to our every whim.  The location is perfect - right in the heart of the old area, on a pedestrian street with no traffic noise.  Yes, it is a little hard to find your first time there (use their airport pickup service just to spoil yourself and avoid any trouble getting there the first time) but once you are there you won't want to leave!

Rooms are fully equipped (with a safe big enough for storing your valuables), and the amenities provided are top notch.  If it is hot (as it was during our stay) the air-conditioning is outstanding - you can pratically cause frost on your windows if you like.  They change the towels during nightly turn down service if you have even moved them during the day.

All in all - I would go back there in a heartbeat!
",5,2005,08,23
14,Great boutique hotel,"2 nights at the Neri proved to be a fabulous choice!  The hotel is located adjacent to the Cathedral, but on a quiet pedestrian street slightly off the beaten path. The service was nothing to brag about, but the rooms were modern and new. (Expensive food and no snacks or ability to bottled water, though.) Great amenities and great shower! Especially great for an American used to American hotels and shocked by European room sizes and styles.  The front desk operates as concierge desk and everyone wears multiple hats at this property. Note: I recommend having the hotel send for a taxi to meet you at the airport as most people do not know this property.
",4,2005,08,01
14,Thieves in the hotel!!!,"WARNING: watch out for your belongings at all time.
We would have loved our two day staying at this precious hotel if it wouldn't have turned to the nightmare of being stolen in our own room by its personel. The hotel management declines all responsability and never take any step to disclose what happened. The appartements are nice, decoration original, but no design is worthy lack of security. Stay away from this hotel, it isn't worthy the trouble.
",2,2005,07,05
14,Fantastic hotel offering great value and friendly service,"We visited the Neri for a long weekend in October to sightsee Barcelona, party and relax.  

In arrival in the early morning our room was not ready, and we were shown to a library/salon to wait and given complimentary drinks by the friendly and helpful staff.

The hotel is in the old town and is a small boutique style venue.  Our room had a high vaulted ceiling, was spacious and beautifully furnished, completed with plasma tv and cd player.  The fantastic bathroom was unusual and stylish with slate floor and tiling.  We enjoyed a gorgeous breakfast in bed - the food was pricey but delicious.

The hotel is ideally located in the old town of Barcelona and provides an excellent place for sightseeing.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone except families with children
",5,2005,06,28
14,The best part of my vacation-Gothic Barcelona,"Spent 2 weeks in Spain - Madrid, Mallorca and Barcelona.  The best was staying at the Hotel Neri in the Barri Gotic district (the old city) of Barcelona.  This 22 room converted house, boutique hotel was simply delightful and the staff were extemely delightful, helpful and accommodating.  Wandering this area of narrow streets and small restaurants and shops was fun while still being close enough to walk to La Rambla, upscale shopping on Passeig de Gracia and other sightseeing venues.  We rented bikes close by (although the hotel does have electric bikes for the use of guests) and rode through the Gothic Quarter and down by the port and beaches. 

In addition the restaurant in the hotel was magnificent--one of the best 3 meals we ate in Spain. (And I was traveling with a food snob who had a list of restaurants recommended by other food snobs and Zaggat).  Try the Mushroom Cannelonis. Yum!
",5,2005,06,19
14,great experience!,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Neri for 2 nights June 5 - 7, 2005 upon termination of our cruise. what would have made this the 'excellent' category would have been a shelf in the separate shower to put soap on. One has to put soap and other toiletries on the floor and then bend down to retireve them.
other than that, the separate soaking tub was wonderful, great water pressure! nice thick bathrobes and slippers are provided as well. Improved lighting in the bathroom would be nice as well

room 301 is lovely with 2 plasma tvs, 3 stations in english. 
furnishings are comfortable.

the hotel has an enviable location in the middle of the Barri Gothic, just down the alley from the Cathedral. It is an easy walk to Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya where the busturistico is based.

The staff is warm and personable, and although we were there early, we ony had to wait about 40 minutes, (while we waited we received esprssos in the hotel library) and were able to enter the room around 11am. I was very impressed.

Be sure to use the taxi service that's recommended for the trip to the airport as our driver from the port never heard of the place and it is in a pedestrian zone. 

The hotel may be pricey,  but I believe it is well worth it.

14,Good but not Great,"I stayed with a friend at the Neri in early May.  I thought I was great with maps but we really did have trouble finding it as both our maps were not accurate and showed an extra little street that did not exist!  On arrival mid afternoon we were told our room was not ready - not a good start.  After getting up at 5 am to catch 2 flights to get there, this was not the welcome we expected.  After a 30 minute wait, we were shown to our twin room which overlooked the square.  The room itself was OK but not what I had expected from reading the other positive reviews on this website.  It was quite small, with very low lighting and very noisy.  Noise from the rooms next door and mainly from the square below.  If you want a lie in do not have a room overlooking the square!  The school children woke me up early every morning and I was awoken twice in the middle of the night by gypsies singing and clapping in the square.  The bathroom was lovely - exposed stone walls made it very atmospheric although our shower did leak.  The roof top terrace was closed when we arrived.  Service on the whole was very good.  We didn't have breakfast but had room service which was excellent.  On the whole I was a bit let down by the hotel but the location more than made up for it - there really is no better place to be based for exploring the beautiful old town and only a few minutes walk from Las Rambals and the main square where the tourist buses are based.

14,Paradise in the Heart of Barcelona,"We discovered Neri as a  beautiful small Hotel in the Gothic area of Barcelona. We recommend this Hotel for all people in search of modern but warm design with great feeling for detail. The presentation as well as the quality and variety of the breakfast were amazing. A great souvenir for us and a recommendation for everybody.
",5,2005,04,29
14,Three memorable nights at the Neri,"Because of the good reviews here, I decided to book this hotel for a stay with my wife as a sort of second honeymoon. It was great from beginning to end. The hotel is in a great location in the oldest past of the city near the cathedral. It is small, stylish and ultra-pleasant. It shows that modern design and an old building go along well. The hotel rooms are not the biggest around, but the quality is outstanding with many personal touches. We enjoyed our stay very much and hope to revisit soon.
",5,2005,04,28
14,Helped celebrate a 21st birthday,"Friendly and helpful, very good position in Barcelona.  Hotel staff picked up from passport that it was our daughter's 21st and presented her with bottle of Cava.  A lovely hotel we will return to.  They recommended good local restaurants and their own looked good although we did not try it.  Only minus was that they could not provide a kettle when my trusty travel kettle let us down.
",5,2005,04,25
14,Disappointed,"We have just returned from a three night stay at the Neri. We have previously been delighted with hotels chosen from recommendations from tripadvisor but were a little disappointed with the Neri. The hotel is very atmospheric, the rooms have very dim lighting which is all very well for romance but not so good for putting on make up and doing your hair ( this is of course from a female point of view). Overall we felt that the hotel had been designed to have immediate visual appeal but it fell down when it came down to being user friendly.
",2,2005,04,19
14,An oasis,"Stayed at the Neri for 3 nights in March on the strength of recommendations read on TripAdvisor. The reviews weren't wrong. It's probably impossible to convey just what an oasis of calm and tranquility the hotel provides in a location that surely cannot be surpassed.Like most of the other reviewers we'd like to think that sometime very soon we'll be back and that really says it all.
",5,2005,03,17
14,Great place,"Just back from 2 day break here. Chose this hotel based on the reviews on this site that all proved spot on. It is a superbly refurbished 'boutique' style hotel. Rooms very well equipped and stylishly designed. 

Location is tricky to find but that's part of the charm. Once found, you are in a great location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. Easy walking distance to the main street La Rambla. 

Didn't eat in the restaurant although it looked very good, but pricey.

Staff at the hotel were really helpful throughout our stay.

The school mentioned in other reviews is definitely there - but we weren't troubled by the noise at all. All part of the Catalan charm!

Would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about going.
",4,2005,03,08
14,Loved it!,"My husband and I stayed here for one night and loved it. It has a great feel to it, as it is housed in a very beautiful and old building yet is ultra modern chic. Our favorites were the sleek furniture, flat screen tv in our bedroom, mood music with great system in our room, and the nice terrace, also in our room.

The downside to this hotel is we got a bit lost getting there carrying all of our luggage, as it is on a tiny pedestrian street. However, it is my understanding that since we stayed there, they offer really detailed video directions on their website. The neigborhood should keep you on your toes, but as long as you are vigilant it should be no problem. We found some great restaurants in the area and really, it was very centrally located.

We would definitely stay there again.
",5,2005,03,01
14,"A calm, contemporary hotel in Barcelona's dark gothic heart","The Neri is a contemporary, high-class hotel set in the very centre of Barcelona's medieval gothic quarter. This part of town is a maze of dark alleys and atmospheric little squares. It is mostly pedestrianised so one will have to walk the last 200m to the hotel.

The hotel itself is set in an old building about 50m from the cloister entrance of Barcelona’s gothic Cathedral. The surrounding streets contain every sort of bar, restaurant and café imaginable. Its location makes the hotel a good base to explore Barcelona from. All the main sights are in walking distance and walking is the way to see this city.

The hotel is dark, calm, stony and all shades of grey. The overall effect was in harmony with the part of town it resides in. Staying in this hotel (during a sunny February) really coloured our view of the town. If one was to stay at, say, the Hotel Arts, you would likely end up seeing Barcelona as a hip, vibrant, modern, squeaky clean, bright town. From the Gothic quarter, Barcelona seems much more complex and the fantastic modernista buildings seem slightly menacing. Gaudi’s buildings in particular look less like playground confections and more like the work of genius.

The hotel was very quiet when we were there but the nature of the area is such that nightlife may well be audible in your room. It only has 22 rooms so the place never seemed crowded. 

Beds were huge and comfortable. Bathrooms were original and good (but no separate shower). No tea and coffee making facilities in the room (thank god) but there was a very well stocked mini bar. Everything was spotlessly clean and everything worked.

The hotel has a small roof terrace where one can catch the sun while listening to the thrum of the town around you and the shouts from the local nursery playground across a square.

All in all – recommended. The place is a real treat

14,Fall in love at the Neri!,"This hotel is extraodinary in every way! 
There is no way to explain how fantastic this hotel is, if you are going to Barcelona, try to stay here if at all possible. It is popular and books fast, so plan ahead,
Romance and glamor in spades, can't say how much I loved it!
Life is short, live well, smile!

",5,2005,02,19
14,Loved it and I can't wait to go back!!!,"I loved the Neri.  I loved the location, the decor, and the staff was awesome.  I even loved the food at the restaurant.  What else can I say...but I can't wait to go back.  If I won the lottery I would consider living here!  It is definitely worth upgrading to a junior suite.  The price difference is minimal and the room is much larger. The hotel is very small so book early.
",5,2005,02,15
14,perfect and cosy for a city break!!,"We stayed here for two nights of our four night holiday in January and it was well worth it!! the rooms get booked up early as there are only about 20 rooms so book early if possible.
    
    The rooms are gorgeous and the staff extremely helpful.  The whole hotel seems to be lit only by candels adding to the romantic ambience, although at times it did feel a bit too dark!  
    
    I would also splash out for a junior suite - I dont think they are much more expensive. 
    
    We ended up with a room that was by the school so unfortunately we did hear the kids in the early morning, but it wasnt so bad.
    
    Staff there recommended Pla restaurant which was amazing and La Fianna bar which is a really cool little bar, neither of these we would have found on our own and are musts while in Barcelona.
    ",4,2005,02,10
14,Discreet Charms Of The Neri,"On Tripadvisor comments I booked this hotel for a short 4 day break - we weren't disappointed. It is the perfect small hotel with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. Having travelled extensively, far too many hotels rely upon offering a plethora of services that guests will never use. The Neri, in common with good hotels, simply concentrates on providing excellent accomodation where a good nights sleep is guaranteed, excellent assistance from the helpful staff, and a wonderful location for sightseeing.

The hotel deserves to succeed.
",5,2005,02,08
14,Honeymooning in Neri,"My husband and I just spent four nights in the Neri Hotel on our honeymoon in Barcelona and would recommend it highly to anyone.
Best points - rose flavoured drink on arrival, chilled cava in the room for the honeymoon couple, very large bath (more than enough room for two!) in stone finished bathroom, large plasma screen tv with films on demand, chocolates and weather forecast on your pillow every evening, charming and extremely helpful staff, the beautifully designed roof terrace, and all things considered, pretty reasonable price for what was on offer.
Some tips - the restaurant is lovely but pricey, and don't eat until after 9:30pm or you'll feel very conspicuous as you'll be the only ones there and the staff are very attentive.  Given the time again, I would not eat there at all, as I felt the experience of eating in the nearby tapas bars was altogether more enjoyable and easier on the wallet.  Same goes for breakfast, which can be found for a whole lot cheaper than 18Euros.
The walk to the hotel is easy, and the small amount of exercise required will do you good after you spend time in Catalonia eating all the lovely food on offer!
The noise from the school can be a bit much, but it's also charming (what nicer noise than kids playing???)  It didn't bother us a bit.",5,2005,02,06
14,Very good,"We stayed at Neri in Sept, for the first few nights of our honeymoon and loved it. The architecture and design is great. We loved our room. It had a view over San Neri square and we were never bothered by the noise. The rooms are a little on the small side but are laid out very well so we never felt cramped. We loved the location, very central, and never  felt concerned for our safety. It is in one of the oldest parts of the city and so there are many narrow alleyways, but tons of shops and people. The walk from where the cabs can drop you off is really not bad, not even a block. We would highly recommend this place to someone interested in staying in a unique hotel.
",4,2005,01,22
14,Need to return to the Neri!!,"Just returned from a fabulous weekend at the Hotel Neri. What a great place to stay. The design of the hotel is truly funky, without being over the top. The rooms are all of a modern style, with the bathrooms finished in stone. The lighting and the BOSE speaker system in the bathrooms are all nice touches, not to mention the wide-screen TV and CD player in the bedroom.

The roof terrace was nice, but we didn't have the weather for it. The breakfast looks a little expensive at 18 Euros, but when it arrived, it was well worth the money! 

All staff are friendly and helpful, and can't do enough for you.

With regards to the location - it couldn't be better - 5 mins walk from Las Ramblas / Catalunya Square, and 2 mins from the Cathedral in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. I have noticed some comments about not being able to get a taxi to the door - big deal! It's a two-minute walk at the most; a small price to pay for the experience you will have when you arrive.
",5,2005,01,20
14,The best!,"The Hotel Neri is one of the best I've ever stayed in!  All of the staff that I ran into were nothing but fabulous, friendly, and accomodating.  It is a little noisy, but if you're going to stay in the city, you should expect this!  I personally think it added to the charm.  You cannot find a better location, close to so many things.  We were only there for 1 day and we saw so much just by walking.  Cabs do drop you off a little ways away from the hotel but it is not dangerous!  My husband and I had no problem walking to the hotel from the cab with 3 suitcases and a carry-on.   Contrary to what some people have written, you will not be worn out or perspiring from the walk!!  The rooms were ultra-modern and the staff will explain EVERYTHING electronic in your room to you!  We would definitely stay here again and have recommended this to many others!!   Enjoy!!
",5,2005,01,18
14,just nice...,"We were not informed about the fact that you have to carry your luggage for more than 5 minutes because the taxi can not get to the hotel. This is not nice specially when is raining.
The hotel is very nice but the neighborhood is dangerous and dirty... Not recommendable.",1,2005,01,10
14,Sensational and Unique,"Spent nine nights in Suite 106 over Christmas/New Years holiday and commend the hotels designers and staff for creating a unique hotel experience - original design, amenities, facilities, comfort - no detail has been over looked.  The best of everything without attitude or pomp and circumstance.  Beautiful rooms, fabulous food, wonderful people, flawless housekeeping.  Glamorous, yet unpretentious and fun - how often can you put those words in one sentence!
",5,2005,01,08
14,Great Hotel,"I can not recommend this hotel enough.  We stayed for four nights for our honeymoon and couldn't fault the service from the rose scented drinks we were served on arrival to the chocolates and weather forecast they discreetly leave on your pillow while you are out.  The location is perfect, right behind the cathedral and 200m from Las Ramblas.  The room was huge as was the bed with all the touches you'd expect from a hotel of this class.  The only tip would be to give eating in the hotel a miss as there are many fabulous restaurants above the Placa Catalunya for a fraction of the price.  Top tip on arrival is to order a glass of champagne on the solarium on the roof - very reasonable.
",5,2004,12,17
14,Perfect Honeymoon Hideaway,"Hotel Neri is a perfect small, modern, and charming hotel.  My wife and I spent our entire 9-day honeymoon in October 2004 at the Hotel Neri and loved every single day.  The staff were amazingly helpful and would do anything you asked.  

The location was perfect for walking all around the old city and quite close to two major Metro stops.  
Taxis can pull right up to the door depending on the time of day and pedestrian traffic.  I suggest you visit the hotel’s website and look at the videos depicting the approaches to the front door so you can help your driver find the hotel.  

The TV and stereo system are great and I highly suggest you bring your favorite CDs.  The speaker system in the bathroom is just one of the many details that the designers of this hotel put in place to make every aspect of the stay enjoyable. (The volume control is behind the stereo, not in the bathroom). Everything really is well planned out but may be different than you are accustomed to in United States (AV/Lighting Controls , procedures, etc.)  We really enjoyed the design elements and the daily attention to detail (cleanliness as well as style) from the staff.

You must know that there is no pool (just go the beach) or valet service (you really don’t need a car) or other things people expect from “5 star” hotels but  I rate this hotel as first class and would recommend Hotel Neri to anyone who asked.  Just don’t tell too many people so that it maintains its hidden charm.  Have a great trip.",5,2004,12,02
14,Would not stay there again,"We recently spent 2 nights at the Neri.  It is a beautiful hotel; however, I must agree that it was incredibly noisy.  We never could not hear street noises.  This goes on until after 2:30 a.m.  Our room was beautiful, ultra modern, but the lighting was very poor.

Really the main complaint is the noise level.  As nice as the room and employees were, I would not stay there again or recommend it because of the noise.
",2,2004,11,14
14,"Sylish, great value in the heart of the gothic quarter","We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Neri which I booked solely on the basis of reviews on this website!  I was not disappointed - the room was ready on our arrival, 2 hours before scheduled, we were given an upgrade and shown to the most beautifully designed room.  The whole hotel has been recently renovated using fabulous materials and fabrics with a sense of 'no expense spared' whilst retaining old architectural features.  The staff were delightful and the price very reasonable.  We recently stayed at the Monaco Grand Canal in Venice and thought that could not be surpassed, but considering that this was a third of the price we were amazed by the Neri and would unreservedly recommend it.
",5,2004,11,01
14,Modern Trendy Hotel,"Hotel Neri reminded me of a trendy New York City hotel. It was the most comfortable hotel we stayed at during our 11 day honeymoon in Spain. The staff is very friendly, accomodating and attentive. The amenities in the room are impressive -- flat screen TV, BOSE stereo system. The little tocuhes make this hotel nice -- the roofdeck, the simple modern decor.

However, as other travellers have noted, taxis cannot get through the small street in front of the hotel so you have to walk a bit. We were a little apprehensive about the safety of the neighborhood at first but found it to be safe (reminded us of the West Village in NYC). Our biggest problem was the noise from the school outside the hotel. Starting at 8:30am and throughout the morning, children are lined up outside in the mini-square in back of the hotel. Then they have recess until early afternoon --I don't know when they are in class. The noise is just mind-numbing and forced us up every morning. It should be alright during the summers but early September, watch out.
",4,2004,10,05
14,Loved Neri Hotel,"Just returned from 2 nights in Neri Hotel.  Best hotel I ever stayed at.  In fact, first time I ever loved a hotel room so much I made an effort to keep it tidy! Loved everything - small & quiet (only 20 rooms), really cool decor, mood lighting in bedroom & bathroom, plasma TV, CD player wide selection of CDs, choice of bed linen.  Staff on reception very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast is amazing - presentation, quantity and quality - well worth €15 charge.  My husband had worried about location in that it is on a quiet pedestrian street but literally 2 minutes from busy square so no problems at all - in fact location was a big plus as near everything.  Rooftop solarium lovely - spent an hour there both evenings and had it to ourselves both days.
",5,2004,08,11
14,Worth a stay,"My wife and I just spent part of our honeymoon at Hotel Neri. Firstly, I can't think of a better location for a hotel than this. It is right in the middle of the Gothis quarter which is where most everything is happening and you can walk to so many interesting restaurants, sites. The hotel is on a small, quiet, mostly pedestrian street which I never would have seen without finding the hotel online first. The street however is not a scary or dangerous one at night as it is connected to a much busier street and two large squares which have constant activity on them late into the night. The hotel is gorgeous, ultra sleek and ultra modern and quite something to see. We stayed in a junior suite and the room was absolutley huge, gorgeously decorated and had great A/C. The room was also very quiet. The room has lots of cool amenities which we really didn't use (2 large plasma screen tv's, cd player in main area and speaker in bathroom, heat lamp in bathroom, choice of bedding material options, seperate shower and tub in bathroom, very well stocked mini bar, etc). The bed was large and very comfy, the room was dusty but clean. Overall, style was placed before function in the hotel which may bother some (ie, very cool and soothing lighting in rooms but not great for reading in bed - or anyhwere in the room, cool rainfall shower head in shower but not that practical if you are showering but not wanting to wash your hair, very beautiful granite walls throughout bathroom but they give off a certain smell when wet that some will love and others will hate). Hotel breakfast was slightly expensive but very good and you can order a bunch of high quality items off a little menu (in addition to the fixed breakfast they serve you) without any additional charge. Our only complaint for this hotel was the staff whom we found unfriendly and often quite irritating. We had some of our clothes washed by the hotel service and when 2 of our clothed did not return, we politely inquired about them and were told repeatedly that we were wrong. To make a long story short, they finally recovered one item and after a few conversations with the staff, got them to take the price of the last missing item off the total price. We were also directed to a few spots in the Gothic quarter by the staff that we later discovered no longer existed. Overall, if you don't need to speak to the staff very much, this hotel is really great and you'll actually look forward to coming back to it after a long day of sightseeing and walking through Antoni Gaudi architectural works.
",4,2004,08,09
14,"Nice boutique hotel, but..........","Just came back from Spain and stayed for two nights at the Neri on recommendations from this site. I reserved thru the internet and was not informed that taxis are not allowed to enter Sant Server St. My wife and I had to drag our luggage from the plaza which is about 50 meters from the hotel. Naturally, we were perspiring and angry when we got there.
The hotel is modernist in design and impressive. The room where we stayed was just right in size but had a huge king size bed. Plasma TV and CD player were nice details. My wife found the room to be dusty. I was impressed by the sound insulation though-never heard noise from either the inside or the outside of the hotel.  The bathroom was well detailed but the shower glass did not close tightly resulting in flooding outside the shower area.  The bose speaker in the bathroom had no volume adjustment and it was too loud.  
Our overall impression was that it was a well done boutique hotel but that there are better options out there in barcelona for the same amount of money.
",3,2004,08,05
14,Perfect choice,"Just returned from Barcelona and we stayed at the Neri Hotel. Previous visit stayed at the Claris, which is a fantastic hotel but at least double price and not as good location. The Neri Hotel is romantic, small and intimate, beautiful, modern but in old setting,  top class and with a perfect location. Service is very good, although lack a concierge. Great roof top solarium, but no swimingpool which the Claris has (who cares - go to the beach instead!) Rooms are spacious, very comfortable and just lovely. Had a superior room (no 304) with a big terrace. Wonderful bathroom. Can choose from different type of bed clothes, which never encountered before (try linen!). CD player and flat screen TV (but who wants to watch TV when you are in Barcelona?). Breakfast is superb!! Ok, maybe expensive, but like many hotels. Try it, and try it on your terrace! They bring you much more food than you can eat! 
Short and sweet - no need to look further - this is the place! And some taxis will take you all the way up to the hotel, although the short walk is no trouble!
",5,2004,08,02
14,Gothic Quarter Gem,"We loved this small and efficient hotel. The staff are discreet but helpful the restaurant is fab and the location is brilliant for exploring the city. There are some great restaurants nearby too. Downsides are smelly drains ( but they do provide joss sticks in the rooms) and the children are noisy at playtime in the school opposite in their rooftop playground. 
Overall a stylish and comfortable hotel good stereo and plasma TV in the room too..

14,lovely hotel and wonderful staff,"I recently spent two nights at the lovely Neri Hotel unfortunately with an ill husband. The hotel is beautiful and the staff superb. I am grateful to have been in such a caring and lovely hotel considering the circumstances of our trip. The front desk staff was warm and compassionate and assisted us in every way possible. The room was clean, quiet and classy. It would be my sincere pleasure to return at a better time and I thank the hotel staff for their assistance during a difficult and unfortunately brief trip.
",5,2004,07,29
14,Absolutely fabulous,"We abolutely LOVED this hotel.  It is exciting, calm, beautiful, good location.  The decor was stunning : an ultra modern bathroom with a stone shower, 15 foot ceilings, plasma tv, and just the right chairs to remind you that are in a 17th century building.  Perfect service too.

It was the highlight of our vacation to Ireland, Barcelona and the Costa Brava.
",5,2004,07,05
14,Go!,"Stayed at the Hotel Neri two weeks ago and all I can say is Wow!  If you are looking to take your girlfriend / boyfriend away for a romantic weekend I cannot recommend it highly enough.  You get a true feeling of indulgence staying there.

On arrival we were given a welcome drink made of rose petals and a little tour of the hotel. 

We had a standard room which was huge and although it didn't have a bath you could fit about 10 people in the shower.  You could even change the colour of the lighting in the bathroom and there was a speaker in the ceiling for you to listen to music.

Our plasma screen TV wasn't attached to the wall which was actually quite good as you could move it around and watch it from the edge of the bed (which was also very large) but the picture quality was poor and it seemed to be very slow at changing channels. 

Had dinner in the hotel on the second night.  Also very good.  If I'm going to be picky I'd say my main course was a little on the salty side and I love salt.  Also it said on the menu it came with a selection of vegetables and potatoes which I didn't receive.  The head waiter was amazing.  Very helpful and when we couldn't decide which cocktail to have he made one up for us which was delicious - a mandarin sour.

The roof terrace was a little on the small side and would be good if it had a pool but the sunbeds were comfy which makes a nice change.  

It's very central and we found it easy to get around / find our way back there.  We felt very safe there and I disagree with other reviews that have mentioned a smell of drains in the hotel.  We didn't notice this at all.  

On the first night we went to an amazing restaurant about 10mins walk from the hotel called Hoffman.  The desserts were like a work of art and the service was spot on.  Approx £120 for a 3 course dinner for 2 with a bottle of champagne and 3 bottles of water.  For the standard of food and service we found this very reasonable.  It would have cost a lot more in London.  The food is very creative so I would only go if you are an adventurous eater.  

Also if you like trendy clothes then it's a five minute walk to the El Bon area.  Again, don't go on a Sunday as nearly all the shops are shut.

If I had one complaint about the hotel Neri I would say it was the dry cleaning / ironing service.  I asked for an iron and ironing board in my room and the ironing board was tiny.  Impossible to iron anything yourself.  So we put lots of things in the dry cleaners thinking it would come back the next day but we had to wait another day for it and because they folded our clothes they looked exactly the same as when we took them out of our cases.  Total waste of money.  When we complained whilst checking out the man on reception knew nothing about it even though we'd mentioned it to other staff several times.  He was also got a bit aggrevated and said that nobody else had complained and made it seem as though we were complaining for nothing or to get out of paying.

We had never seen this man on reception before this and would say that all of the other staff were lovely and very helpful.

I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay at this hotel and I would definitely go back.  Have been recommending it to all my friends!
",5,2004,06,29
14,Loved the Neri Hotel,"We found out about the Neri Hotel on tripadvisor. And what a great find it was. A wonderful start to our pre-cruise from Barcelona. The hotel is beautiful in the 
Gothic Quarters, with so much to see in walking distance.  The service is outstanding from the moment we walked in the doors. We were greeted in the lobby with sparkling rose water and then escorted to the dining room for a breakfast buffet set up at our table with local cheeses, meats, and pastries.
Our rooms were out of this world decorated in a Zen atmosphere, spacious bathrooms with great amenities,as well as bath ropes and slippers. The beds were very comfortable. The balcony overlooked the Gothic Quarters, and don't forget  to check out the rooftop terrace.
We were also fortunate to have a driver the hotel sent to pick us up at the airport who also gave us a guided four hour tour that afternoon.His name is Armando Panedas,I would high recommend him if you need a guide, his prices are very reasonable. His phone no. is (34) 60-419-756, he is with BCN tour-taxi. We stayed at the Neri in June,2004. I hope we have an opportunity to visit Barcelona and the Neri Hotel again soon.   
",5,2004,06,21
14,Perfect!,"We just spent three nights in a junior suite at the Neri, and we can honestly say that this has been our best hotel experience EVER! We immediately felt at home - the room and bathroom was beautiful and very spacious, the furniture, ambience, bathroom amenities - everything was just perfect. The location couln't be better - we were able to walk to everything we wanted to see. We also had dinner at the restaurant on the night of arrival, very delicious and the setting - the old building, modern decor and the music - all made it very special. 
The staff was so friendly and helpful and the roomservice very good. The breakfast is a bit pricey, but so delicious it's definitely worth the money. The only downside is that from now on, every hotel that we'll stay in will have a hard time living up to the Neri! Thank you, all Neri staff, for a truly wonderful time! We would come back in a heartbeat!
",5,2004,06,18
14,Loved the Neri Hotel,"We too loved this Hotel.Fabulous furnishings, modern and tasteful, but in an old, traditional building. Quite one of the most 'suitable' hotels we have stayed in, and so reasonably priced. I thoroughly recommend the Hotel Neri.
",5,2004,06,14
14,Brilliant location,"Have just returned from a 3 day break with three other couples and what a wonderful time we had. The Hotel Neri is in a great location a short stroll from the Ramblas and a pleasant walk to the harbour. The hotel itself is very elegant the staff are extremely helpful it was quiet and the security was good. The rooms are atractive and elegant ours was particularly spacious as we had a small suite however the lighting in our sitting room was definitely ""mood"" lighting and in other words it was impossible to read a book or a wine bottle label!Barcelona was great fun and we felt very secure the whole time we were there, would definitely return to the Hotel Neri if we were in Barcelona in the future.

14,Hotel Neri - a chic & tranquil hotel in a fabulous city.,"The Neri is absolute chic-boutique! The location is excellent - 
literally meters from the Cathedral in a tiny pedestrianised street so 
there is no noise to speak to of.The decor of the rooms is stylish, 
using lots of lavish fabrics throughout. In our room we had a painting 
of a white lily which spanned 2 meters across one of the walls - quite 
beautiful - and tiny, sparkling pendant lights hovering over each 
bedside table. The staff are very helpful and discreet, and as the 
hotel only has around 20 rooms it rarely seemed busy and retained a 
sense of calm throughout our stay. Add to this all this a fantastic 
bathroom, plasma screen, CD player (with a speaker in the loo too!) and 
a host of added little luxuries - and you have a truely lovely hotel 
which we cannot recommend highly enough.

14,In a word - Superb,"The newly opened Neri Hotel + restaurante is fantastic. We have been travelling to Barcelona for many years and have stayed in some lovely hotels but the Neri is the best. The hotel is a 17th century building that has been renovated to the highest standard without losing its historical charm.

The interior design is very cool. All the rooms appear to original art on the walls and the attention to detail with the furnishings is excellent. The staff are friendly and helpful. The restaurante is very good and is full most nights so it's better to book in advance. You can't help but hope that some of the coolness at the Neri rubs off on you when you see Spaniards and toursists alike peer through the enterance to admire to stunning interior.

As for the location you couldn't want for a better position to explore Barcelona. You are minutes away from Las Ramblas, Catedral Square and basically in the middle of the Barri gotic. We will definately be returning to Barcelona to stay at the Neri next year.",5,2003,12,22
14,Perfect hotel in perfect location at a perfect time.,"Perfect hotel in perfect location just to Mercè. Due to its very quiet location in the middle of the Barri Gòtic, the limousine cannot possibly drive to the hotel. The solution is Thomas, who also picked us up with our luggage, speaking German, as politely as he did personally, and later delivered us again. In the impressive lobby of the Neri we were received perfectly. Neri includes a restaurant that has tables in the historic Placa Sant Felip Neri. Dinner here is one of the highlights of our visit to Barcelona.",5,2024,10,03
14,Unique space for company events,"Recently, we had the opportunity to rent the room ""La Favorita"" at the Neri hotel for a work meeting and the experience was exceptional. From the beginning, the hotel staff offered us all kinds of help and technical material necessary to make our meeting a success. 

In addition, the hotel had the generous gesture of presenting us with coffee and something to snack on, which was greatly appreciated by all attendees. It was a great way to break up between sessions, really.

As for the food, the experience also exceeded our expectations. The dishes were perfectly prepared and presented, standing out both for their taste and their freshness. The service at the restaurant was impeccable, with attentive and friendly staff who made sure we were not missing anything at any time.

We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to host events or just enjoy great food.",5,2024,07,09
14,It was the ideal place for our wedding celebration.,"We got married at Barcelona City Hall and we already knew the cuisine of A Restaurant, so it seemed like the perfect place for the subsequent celebration. The environment is fantastic and the restaurant has that perfect balance between tradition and modernity that we like so much. The staff was attentive at all times and responded to all our requirements. The food was exquisite and I would definitely celebrate there again. See you at 25!",5,2024,05,18
14,Very good,"The location of the hotel is very good and the atmosphere is super cozy. Very quiet despite being in the center of the city.

the guys at the reception were all very kind, they really made our stay special Tomas (the porter) who welcomed us back every day with a big smile when we returned and Guillermo (barman) who made us something to drink every evening and exchanged a few words with us !
When we return to Barcelona there is no doubt that we will return to Neri again ❤️",5,2024,01,28

Llegamos por la tarde y nos atendió un chico muy agradable de la recepción; nos invitó a tomar algo mientras nos daba las llaves y nos explicaba todo con detalle. El personal en todo momento muy agradable y con una sonrisa.
Decidimos cenar en el restaurante del hotel y probamos la exquisita comida; los platos se degustan diferente cuando te explican sobre lo que lleva y como está cocinado.
Después dar un paseo por las callejuelas del barrio, llenas de vida, tiendas locales, productos artesanales; volvimos al hotel para dormir en las nubes! Una de las mejores camas en las que hemos dormido nunca. Esto sí que es lujo real!
Cuando volvamos a Barcelona, volveremos a Hotel Neri sin lugar a dudas.
Muy  recomendable",5,2023,06,06

El ambiente del restaurante es acogedor y elegante, con una decoración moderna y minimalista que a la vez conserva el encanto de la arquitectura histórica del edificio.

Menús degustación de 55€ y 80€. Pedimos el de 55€: completo, no te qiedas con hambre y vinos aceptables pra el menú. Entrantes y pulpo muy bueno. Canelon de bacalao, así, así. Y pollo rebozado bueno, pero nada de otro mundo y menos para un menú degustación. El gintònic impecable.

14,Ein absoluter Skandal. Angemessen für die Apartments sind maximal 2-3 Sterne!,"Gemeinsam mit meiner Partnerin habe ich ein Wochenende im Neri Hotel in Barcelona verbracht. Schon die Anreise war chaotisch.Die Rezeption war nicht in der Lage zu organisieren, dass in der Nähe des Hotels unser Fahrzeug vom Hotelpersonal übernommen wird um es in der öffentlichen Tiefgarage zu parken. Sie waren auch nicht in der Lage, uns den Standort des Parkhauses per WhatsApp zusenden. Wir waren nicht im Hotel, sondern in den so- genannten Apartments. Das Bad hat maximal 3 m² inklusive Toilette. Das Apartment war verwohnt, Fugen dreckig und insgesamt ungepflegt. Das Geschirr und die Gläser sind von IKEA. Das Hotel hat fünf Sterne und gehört zu Relais Chateau! Ein absoluter Skandal. Angemessen für die Apartments sind maximal 2-3 Sterne! Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist unterirdisch!",2,2022,11,13

14,Hotel imprescindible si se visita Barcelona ,"Éste es un hotel donde, al menos una vez en la vida, uno debería alojarse. El encanto del mismo se advierte desde su misma entrada. Su esmerada decoración, los detalles para ser admirados, los preciosos espacios comunes...todo desprende un halo de lujo elegante, de ése que se piensa para ser disfrutado por el huesped. La habitación invita al descanso, a dormir bien y a pasar tiempo en ella. 
Pero lo que para mí destaca por encima de lo demás es el trato: extremadamente profesional, los detalles son su especialidad. Gracias a Hotel Neri por hacerme sentir tan bien. Estoy segura que repetiré mi visita.",5,2021,10,14
14,Buen rincón en el gótico,"aRestaurante del Hotel Neri. Servicio y cocina impecable. El cocinero, un crack. Recetas originales, sabores fuertes, pensadas para compartir.

Algo caro",4,2021,09,21
14,Eccellente,"Sono stato con i miei amici a bere qualcosa. Mi avevano parlato di questo hotel e della piazza sulla quale si affaccia. Il luogo è meraviglioso, l’accoglienza è attenta e calorosa.

14,PERFECTO,"Cena un dia normal. Restaurante del hotel, moderno pero en local medieval. A pesar de la terraza, cenamos en el interior por el aire acondicionado. Comida de diseño de muy alto nivel. Personal muy profesional y precio razonable. Aconsejable!",5,2021,08,26
14,Como en un cuento,"El restaurante del hotel esta ubicado en una plaza idílica, comer viendo como caen las florecitas amarillas del árbol nos pareció como estar en un cuento.
El menú cuidado tiene platos sorprendentes como taten de rabo de toro que estaba riquísima.",5,2021,08,13
14,Quiero y no puedo,"Este hotel representa la falacia por excelencia todo eso embalado con una sonrisa bonita. Muchas maneras pero poco fondo. Había reservado una habitación con vistas a la plaza, y solo me dieron una habitación interior con estupenda vista a una pared a 3 metros.  En el momento de la reserva, pedi una habitación con terraza y jacuzzi, y claramente ni terraza, ni jacuzzi. Pedi una cama supletoria y la cama no estaba preparada, Pregunté horarios de cena, desayuno, y wifi a la persona que me recibió y no sabía. Ha sido una llegada atropellada, sin solución, con mala fe, y no digno de la cadena ""Relais et Chateaux"" y tampoco de las tarifas que practican. Coji mis maletas y me fui a por otro hotel, y lo conseguí. Evidentemente, la manager ni se molestó en intentar solucionar la situación lo que me pareció el colmo de la falta de profesionalidad. Un engaño en toda regla y sin clase.",1,2021,08,08

14,Meraviglioso!,"Sono stato in questo bellissimo albergo con un gruppo di amici e siamo stati divinamente.
Nel cuore del quartiere gotico, pieno di fascino, elegantissimo e raffinato, pulitissimo.
Le stanze sono ampie e luminose, molto confortevoli, la prima colazione è FANTASTICA, il personale efficientissimo e molto gentile.
Voglio menzionare in particolare Veronica Mansson, manager dell’hotel, che ci ha aiutato con una professionalità ed una disponibilità davvero straordinari.

14,Wunderschöne Oase im Barri Gotic,"Das Hotel liegt mitten im Barri Gotic, dem ältesten Teil der Altstadt von Barcelona, an einem kleinen und recht verzauberten Platz (übrigens einem alten Friedhof). Inmitten des alten jüdischen Viertels und zwei Minuten von der Kathedrale. Wer die Atmosphäre von geschichtsträchtigen Orten sucht, ist hier richtig. Das Hotel setzt einen sehr geschmackvollen Kontrapunkt zu der Geschichte seiner Mauern mit modernen, farbenfrohen und individuellen Design. Wer Spaß hat an Esprit, ist hier richtig. Last but least habe ich die Dachterasse geliebt. Ein Preis für die zentrale Lage ist die Erreichbarkeit: Teilweise kommen die Taxis nicht direkt vor das Hotel. Für mich hat das den Charme ausgemacht, aber das muss nicht jeder so sehen.",5,2019,06,16
14,Comida especial ,"Restaurante con un ambiente íntimo y acogedor.

Todo lo que pedimos estaba buenísimo: flan de foie, pulpo a la brasa..., la atención del personal muy correcta, y los baños estaban muy limpios, con detalles como toallas (las cuales repusieron en el corto tiempo que estuvimos) y crema de manos.

La verdad es que solamente puedo decir cosas positivas de mi estancia, empezando por el edificio, un Palacio Medieval que te deja boquiabierto en pleno Barrio Gótico, la amabilidad del personal, muy serviciales, la maravillosa habitación con terraza en la que me he encontrado un libro de Vázquez Moltabán que me ha enganchado (y que me han permitido comprar en el Check Out!), el desayuno espectacular (en bandeja individual y con platos a la carta!) y la terraza de la última planta en la que disfrutar de un buen cóctel en un entorno agradable y romántico.
Sin duda alguna, repetiré.",5,2017,08,25

Está vuelta  acudí con mi familia a disfrutar de una simple cena con hamburguesas, ensalada y buen vino todo exquisito, pero lo mejor fue el trío cubano con música en vivo en esta terraza cosa que enamora y vas disfrutando de todo aquello al compás de boleros y melodías que se hacen eternas y súper agradables en aquel entorno!!

14,Encantador,"Nos atendio muy amablemente tanto el chico de la tarde, como posteriormente el de la noche, que nos recomendo sitios para comer.
La habitacion muy amplia y con el techo muy alto. Todos los detalles muy cuidados.
Muchas gracias a todo el equipo del Neri.",5,2016,12,08

14,Magnífica restauración y ubicacion,"Enclavado en El Barrio Gótico, es el lugar perfecto para perderte unos días en Barcelona! Restaurante excelente, habitaciones perfectas y un servicio correcto! El hotel consta de dos edificios de siglos distintos unidos y restaurados con un gusto exquisito. Volveremos sin duda!!!",5,2016,10,18
14,excelente ubicacion,"excelente ubicacion, excelentes servicio e instalaciones. debe llegar en taxi por que el acceso es limitado en la zona donde esta ubicado el hotel. pero vale la pena quedarte en el corazon del casco viejo de barcelona!",5,2016,09,06

Die Dachterasse mit Bar war wunderschön!Zimmer mit Blick in den Innenhof-zur Kirche unbedingt nehmen! Alles sehr sauber und liebevoll gestaltet!Zentraler geht es glaub ich nicht mehr! Gerne kommen wir wieder!
",5,2016,08,24
14,Comunque una tappa piacevole,"Buona posizione anche se non semplice da raggiungere, staff attento e professionale. Connubio tra antico e moderno particolarmente riuscito, buoni gli spazi, camere confortevoli e curate nei dettagli. WIFI non ottimale, come non è ottimale il rapporto qualità/prezzo ma approfittando delle molte offerte speciali, il rapporto può diventare buono. La colazione non è compresa e non è regalata. Ristorante all’altezza, ottimo servizio, bella carta. Complessivamente più un 4 Stelle che un 5, ma comunque una tappa piacevole.",4,2016,08,16
14,Buena estancia.,"Excelente servicio, habitaciones y comida en pleno corazón histórico de Barcelona. Buen trato y ambiente decoración esmerado. El silencio en las habitaciones permite descansar y relajarse. La terraza permite ver una parte de la ciudad y de las montañas a lo lejos, y tomar una bebida o comer.",5,2016,07,14
14,Conciertos,"Hotel espectacular muy céntrico y con un servicio profesional, su restaurante es muy recomendable , la única pega es que al estar en calle peatonal es complicado llegar en coche incluso usando Taxi.
Tiene una terraza muy acogedora aunque no la utilizamos por falta de tiempo pero nos la mostraron muy amablemente",5,2016,07,13
14,Decepcion pero personal muy atento,"No es desde luego mi concepto de relais chateaux,el desayuno es lo mejor del hotel,las instalaciones son de lo mas normal,la habitacion es moderna y pequeña, lo que le salva es la ubicacion,la plaza neri tiene muy bonita historia,pero repito no es ni de lejos un relais chateaux",3,2016,07,08
14,como en casa,"fabuloso hotel, cuidado, limpio, el personal maravilloso, lo recomiendo. Situado en zona tranquila, la terraza para quedarte todo el día en ella, no puedes encontrar un solo pero. Lo mejor sin duda el personal!!!!!",5,2016,07,08
14,"Schönes Hotel, zentral gelegen","Das schöne Hotel Neri liegt sehr zentral in der gotischen Altstadt, trotzdem ist es recht ruhig. Das Hotel und die Zimmer sind schön und gut eingerichtet. Das Personal ist sehr nett und bemüht, im Bereich Reception wären aber manchmal bessere Absprachen wünschenswert. Abstriche gibt es für das recht unpraktische Badezimmer. Man sollte es den Designer mal benutzen lassen, er würde evtl. dann auch merken, dass man die Badetücher nicht aufhängen kann und, dass das Licht schlecht ist.

Frühstück ist gut, wir konnten es immer wunderbar draussen auf dem kleinen Platz einnehmen.",4,2016,06,27
14,Provenza e Barcellona,Posizione bellissima al centro del quartiere Gotico e ideale per girare a piedi Barcellona. Personale gentilissimo e preparato. Camere silenziose e confortevoli. Personale gentile e preparato a consigliare e assistere durante il soggiorno.,5,2016,06,26

14,Hotel muy gotico y lujoso,"Muy buen hotel, con mucho diseño lujo pero conservando su estilo gotico.
Lugar central y tranquilo, cerca de la zona turistica, cerca de la catedral y ayuntamiento, lo cual lo hace seguro a pesar de sus pasadizos oscuros.
No tiene acceso vehicular, problema si vas con muchas maletas.",5,2016,06,22
14,Espectacular,"Un hotel romántico, ideal para ir con el marido. Los recepcionistas de 10, y el servicio de habitaciones muy atento. Lo recomendaría sobre todo para parejas que quieran un fin de semana privado y relajado. Sin duda repetiremos cuando volvamos a Barcelona.",5,2016,06,19
14,Le Chateaux del Gotico,"Aunque vivimos a 20 minutos del centro de Barcelona, de vez en cuando nos hacemos los turistas y nos sumergimos en el barrio gótico de la capital catalana, y todo lo hacemos para pararnos en el Neri y disfrutar de siglos de historia adaptada a nuestros tiempos de la mano del mejor staff que podáis imaginar. 
Cuidan al detalle cada esquina del edificio y cada necesidad, párense aunque sea a tomar una copa de cava en su terraza ""roba estesa"" (ropa tendida), un auténtico oasis en medio del barullo del barrio judío barcelonés. 
Les dejo unas imágenes de una entrevista que le estaban haciendo al Perla (guitarrista flamenco) para el primer canal de Rusia. ",5,2016,05,19
14,Extrem charmantes Hotel inmitten der Stadt,"Meine Frau und ich haben dieses charmante Hotel 4 Tage lang genossen, perfekte Lage im Barri Gotic, super Personal, schöne Zimmer, beeindruckender Vorplatz, nettes Frühstück, volles Wohlfühlen ! Tolle Kunst in der Lobby und den Gängen! Zimmer mit Blick auf den Platz nehmen!",5,2016,04,25
14,"Schöne Mittagspause, feiner Lunch","Das Hotel Neri ist etwas versteckt im Barrio Gothico gelegen. Sobald man das Hotel betritt, erkennt man die wertige, schöne Ausstattung und die liebevollen Details. Wir wollten, auch aufgrund der guten Bewertungen hier auf tripadvisor, dort zum Mittagessen sein. Wir hatten nicht reserviert, kein Problem. Sehr schönes, angenehm eingerichtetes Restaurant, netter Service und ein gut gemachtes, wirklich leckeres 3-Gängemenü, das seinen Preis (inkl. Wein 24 Euro) wert war. Hat Spaß gemacht, gerne wieder.",4,2016,04,18
14,Top Lage in einem alten Stadthaus im gotischen Viertel,"Als Repeater kennen wir das Hotel: top Lage im gotischen Viertel in einem alten Stadthaus. Mitten in der Altstadt gibt es keine Fernsicht, ausser die Sicht in die Nachbarwohnungen. Dies kann nachts zu Lärm führen, also gehen sie nicht als erste ins Bett. Innen ist das Neri geschmackvoll eingerichtet mit sichtbarem Mauerwerk. Die Zimmer sind angenehm gross und hoch. Das Personal an der Rezeption ist sehr hilfsbereit und organisiert Taxi, Restaurant oder einen Stadtführer inkl. Eintrittskarten. Das Frühstück entspricht nicht Relais & Chateau und hat noch grosses Entwicklungspotential. Aber insgesamt: ein spezielles Hotel an einem speziellen Ort in einer wunderschönen Stadt.",3,2016,04,14
14,Celebramos nuestra 10º aniversario de casados donde también hicimos el convite.,"Diez años después de casarnos en el Hotel Neri decidimos volver y pasar una noche. Comimos en el restaurante y pasamos una noche maravillosa. La señorita Claudia Bou nos hizo un upgrading espectacular y encontramos una botella de cava en la suite. Al día siguiente desayunamos en el buffet y desgraciadamente tuvimos que volver a casa.
Quiero agradecer a todo el personal del hotel habernos tratado de una manera tan exquisita. Sin duda uno de los mejores hoteles de Barcelona!!",5,2016,03,06
14,"Moderno, trato fantástico, pero muy pesado el room service, buscando propina constantemente y entrando sin llamar","Modernos, trato fantástico, pero muy pesado el room service, buscando propina constantemente y entrando sin llamar a la habitación. Por lo demás, estuvieron muy atentos, el baño tenía estropeado el desagüe y no lo arreglaron de inmediato",4,2016,02,01
14,Pequeño hotel con encanto,"Hotel situado muy cerca de la Plaza Sant Jaume de Barcelona, pegado al Palacio de la Generalitat, en cuanto al restaurante decir que tienen un menú de diario sobre unos 15 euros con una relación calidad-precio muy buena, si se puede recomiendo comer en la terraza que da a la Plaza Felip Neri, maravillosa !!!",4,2016,01,23
14,No se merece ser de la cadena Relais& Chateaux,"Aunque está en un sitio inmejorable y el hotel es precioso es una pena la explotación que hacen de los empleados. La señorita de recepción, un encanto por cierto, fue la que se encargó hasta de subir las maletas y también la vimos hacer una cura sin importancia a un cliente.
El desayuno bastante incompleto y también carente de servicio.
Una pena, la cadena no debería consentir todo esto.",1,2016,01,06
14,Luxus in der Altstadt,"Sehr komfortables, kleineres Hotell in der Altstadt, an einem schlönen kleinen Platz gelegen, mit hübschen Außenbereich und einladender Bar,  nette Zimmer, sehr engagiertes Personal, gutes spanisches Frühstück, kein internationaler Hotelstil, sondernn sehr katalanisch, Joggingnähe zum Meer, dennoch absolut zentral in der Fußgöngerzone, deshalb tagsüber etwas laut. Schöne Dachterasse.",4,2015,12,22
14,Hotel elegante in una posizione unica,"Abbiamo sperimentato durante il ponte dell'Immacolata l'Hotel Neri: ottima scelta! Ambiente raffinato e accogliente, con interessante arredo di design, in uno splendido edificio storico sapientemente ristrutturato; personale cortese e preparato, atmosfera tranquilla e rilassante. La posizione, accanto alla cattedrale,  è strategica per visitare a piedi il quartiere gotico e dintorni, inclusa la spiaggia di Barceloneta, e la vicinanza ai mezzi pubblici permette di raggiungere comodamente altri punti di interesse. Un consiglio: meglio non portare troppo bagaglio, se si vuole raggiungere l'hotel a piedi dalla cattedrale, visto che le stradine hanno la pavimentazione originale del medioevo...
La nostra camera al terzo piano si affacciava su una piazzetta alberata, e quasi potevamo toccare i bellissimi gargoyle della costruzione medioevale adiacente. 
Da non perdere il ristorante, con piatti raffinati ma non stravaganti. Complimenti allo chef, che ha saputo riempire i ravioli contro ogni legge della fisica: sembrava  che in due soli ravioli fosse contenuta un'intera aragosta! Il quartiere era piuttosto caotico visti i giorni di festa, ma all'interno dell'hotel il relax era assicurato. Consiglio quest'hotel perché sa dare attenzione al cliente in modo raffinato e non invadente.",5,2015,12,15
14,Ist das eine Location fuer ein Hotel?????,"Das Hotel liegt in der Mitte der Stadt und ist mit dem Auto nur beschraenkt zu erreichen. Die Gasse ist so schmal, dass man nur rueckwaerts vor die Hoteltuer kommt.
Der Service im Hause ist recht amateurhaft, aber nicht schlecht.
Ein zweiter Aufenthalt wird in Barcelona sicherlich nicht wieder  im Neri sein.
Allerdings gibt es fast kein zentral gelegeneres Hotal als das Neri.
Auch hier moechte ich anmerken, dass ich auf relativ hohem Niveau meckere. Letztendlich finde ich, dass das Preis/Leistungsverhaeltnis nicht passt.",3,2015,12,13
14,Me encanta,"Romantico , sexy , relajante ...no nos hemos quedado en el hotel porque residimos en la ciudad , mi opinion es porque hemos comido y hemos tomado unos tragos muchas veces ( epoca Navideña , Verano , terraza , interior , Roba Estesa ) y hemos llevado a amigos que vienen de fuera y han quedado encantados , siempre nos lo recuerdan , es algo caro pero el entorno lo vale 👌",5,2015,12,09
14,Muy agradable ,"El hotel muy bueno. Servicio excelente. Las habitaciones de muy buen tamaño, muy limpias y baño excelente. El personal muy atento y el restaurante bueno (sobre todo para desayunar). Excelentemente bien situado en el barrio gótico, cerca de todo. Sin duda, muy recomendable. ",5,2015,12,05
14,Fabuloso,"La mar de agradable y un servicio exquisito. La calidad del café y del bocadillo bárbara. Marcin derramó el cola cao y no solo se lo repusieron sino que le regalaron chuches!
La plaza en la que se encuentra es de las más bonitas de Barcelona

",5,2015,10,25
14,Perfect place in barcelona!,"Das hotel ist unheimlich geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Mitten im gotischen Viertel eine wahre Oase zum ausspannen und barcelona entdecken. Es war traumhaft dort. Allein dem frühstück würden wir keine Top Punktezahl geben, es fällt recht übersichtlich aus, ansonsten alles was man von einem 5-sterne Hotel erwartet.",4,2015,10,16
14,Agradable,"Muy buena ubicación, personal muy amable. Hotel 100% recomendable para viaje de turismo, familia, pareja o negocios. El wifi funciona muy bien. Solo buenas razones para volver. Muy buen gusto! Muy limpio este hotel.",5,2015,08,31
14,simplicidad que hace al buen gusto.,"siempre no es necesario demasiadas cosa,para pasarla naravillosamente,lo simple hace la diferencia, y es muy dificil encontrar un lugar decorado sin demasados lujos,pero que refleja exactamente  la armonia  , .Musica tranquila, en el corazon del gotico barcelones.Con un lugar secreto escondido en su azotea,",4,2015,07,18
14,Maravilloso hotel,"Alojarse en Neri es una experiencia única para los sentidos. Ideal, una autentica joya.

14,Non il solito R&C,"Mi sono recato nella struttura mosso da fascino della catena sinonimo di eccellenza.
L'accoglienza e gli ambienti risultano curati e ben studiati,tutti ritagliati con dovizia attorno al cliente in un modern chic che dà calore e lusso.
Il servizio ad essere sinceri non da cinque stelle. Di certo.
La qualità dei prodotti senza dubbio buona.
Il prezzo quindi esagerato 400 euro per la mezza pensione in matrimoniale/notte.
Da migliorare su questo.
Un incoraggiamento ma anche un bravi a tutti.",3,2015,05,23
14,Romanticismo e tranquillità.,"Romanticismo e tranquillità in un ambiente elegante e raffinato. E' posizionato in una zona strategica nelle vicinanze della Cattedrale.. Eccellente l'accoglienza e ottima la professionalità dello staff; un apprezzamento particolare a Jacopo per i preziosi consigli, le attenzioni e la disponibilità prestate. 
Consigliatissismo in occasione di una visita alla città.",5,2015,05,16

14,Muy agradable.,"Las fotos de internet no le hacen juicio al imponente edificio con que nos encontramos.
La habitación encantadora, con una decoración cálida y espacios muy bien resueltos. 
La atención del personal por demás cordial.
Si bien a la hora del desayuno se veían un tanto desbordados por la cantidad de huéspedes, la amabilidad del personal contrarrestó este detalle.",5,2015,04,17
14,"MUY BIEN, COMO LO ESPERABA","Noche de pareja, en un antiguo palacete medieval. La habitación fantástica. El servicio de hotel muy correcto. En fin, cuando se pueda se repetirá. Aconsejable.
Una pequeña pega fue el desayuno. La mesa era muy pequeña y el salón también. Además, me trajeron una mermelada que ya había sido abierta previamente (un pequeño desliz). Parking muy caro (33 euros día completo).",4,2015,03,16
14,Encantador,"El hotel se encuentra en el barrio gótico cerca de la catedral en una locación muy cómoda si quieres conocer Barcelona y recorrerla un poco caminando. Las instalaciones son muy lindas pero lo mejor de todo me pareció el trato del personal, desde el recepcionista jacobo hasta los camareros del desayuno fueron todos muy amables. Muchas gracias por hacer nuestra estadia estupenda. Volveremos seguramente",5,2015,02,10
14,Agradable y detallista,"Estuve cenando con un compañero alérgico al gluten. Y desde el inicio al final todo el personal tuvo un especial cuidado con mi invitado, explicando la elaboración de los platos. Situado en un rincón especialmente bonito detrás de la catedral.   ",5,2015,01,06
14,Week end indimenticabile,"Sono stata con mio marito in questo meraviglioso hotel 3 notti per festeggiare il nostro anniversario di matrimonio. Era la nostra prima volta a Barcellona ed in un relais chateaux (è passato da 4 a 5 stelle durante la nostra permanenza) e tutto ha soddisfatto le nostre aspettative... Romantico, elegante, sobrio e incantevole",5,2014,12,09
14,Nel centro del barrio Gotico un hotel super confortevole,"Si trova nel cuore del barrio Gotico in un palazzo ristrutturato in modo eccellente: un albergo che incarna la mia idea di relais chateaux. Con un servizio ottimo per cortesia, efficienza e qualità. Ottimo il ristorante. Perfetta la posizione e le stanze, contemporanee, ma perfettamente integrate nello spirito del quartiere. Unico micro difetto la Wi-Fi non eccezionale (ma comunque free per gli ospiti)",5,2014,12,08
14,Wir lieben das Hotel,"Ein Geheimtipp in einer sehr abgelegenen Gasse des Barri Gotic in Barcelona. Moderne, schicke Zimmer, netter Service. Blick auf einen kleinen Hinterhof. Frühstück nett und von ansprechender Qualität. Ich finde man spürt etwas Zafons Barcelona. Mit dem Taxi kann man nicht vorfahren, also ist mit dem Koffer kleiner Fußmarsch angesagt. Uns hat es nicht gestört, im Hotel ruhige und angenehme Atmosphäre. ",4,2014,10,06
14,mi hotel para la próxima visita a Barcelona,"si bien no estuve alojada en el hotel descubrí la plazoleta por casualidad, me senté en la terraza al aire libre a tomar algo con el rumor de la fuente de fondo y entré a espiar un poco las instalaciones porque me encantó. el lugar es hermosísimo y brinda un remanso de paz y belleza en el medio de la zona de la Barcelona vieja en pleno Barri Gotic.",5,2014,09,14
14,Excelente....  Maravilloso,"Me aloje en julio de 2014, viajando con en familia y con un bebe de 5 meses. Nos parecio Hermosisimo .... La ubicacion excepcional...  El hotel boutique se encuentra sobre  la plaza Felipe Neri... Muy cerca de la plaza del pi.... Un sitio soñado... Calmo... muy cerca de la catedral... Casi en el barrio gotico... 
            En un ambiente fantastico.... unico.... donde se puede disfrutar tanto del silencio  de las noches como de las dulces  campanadas que emiten varias capillas cercanas..
Las habitaciones maravillosas.. Las camas... Sabanas...almohadas...  Los muebles excelentes....La iluminacion del cuarto.... El buen gusto en el diseño... La suavidad de las telas (sabanas.. Toallas... Etc) . Tiene tambien una pequeña terraza donde se sirven tragos y algunas noches con musica en vivo... 
El desayuno espectacular... La calidad y frescura de los alimentos del desayuno....  La calida  y eficiente atencion de todos los empleados, especialmente de Jacopo (recepcionista de la noche). Todo el hotel guarda un encanto particular...sus aromas...la particular iluminación... la calidad de las comidas del restaurante servidas en las mesas de la plaza Neri... Y la suave musica de todo el establecimiento..(un edificio del siglo XII ) totalmente renovado con tan buen gusto que gratifica al huésped a cada instante..  Sin duda merece categoría 5 estrellas...",5,2014,08,03
14,"Hotel ""Relais Histo"", in San Pietro sul Mar Piccolo (Apulien)","Ehemaliger, alter Gutshof, welcher in siebenjähriger Arbeit sanft renoviert wurde. Grosse Ruhe, ca. 15 Kilometer ausserhalb von Taranto inmitten von Olivenhainen und an einem kleinen See gelegen. Riesige Zimmer, wundervoll und in einem modernen Stil ausgestattet. Man fühlt sich sofort wohl, in den Gebäuden, dem prachtvollen Garten und am Swimmingpool. Zum Hotel gehört auch eine SPA Anlage mit verschiedenen Wellnessbereichen, ein sehr gutes Restaurant ""La Latermaia"" und eine Kapelle, in welcher grössere Veranstaltungen durchgeführt werden können.
Das Besitzerehepaar arbeitet mit und steht für grosse Freundlichkeit, auch von Seiten des Personals.
Für uns jederzeit eine Reise wert, um in diese tolle Welt abzutauchen.",5,2014,06,23
14,Tolles Ambiente,"Das Hotel Neri befindet sich in der Altstadt von Barcelona in einem altem Palazzo und gehört zu den Relais et Chateaux Hotels. Der Service ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.

se ubica este hotel, en  un edificio historico, con un ambiente selecto, con un servicio esmerado y atento, y con una cocina excelente.

Y el precio esta ajustado a su calidad.",4,2013,09,05
14,Geniales Hotel! Klein aber fein.,"Kleines Hotel mit sehr geschmackvoller  Einrichtung. Das Badezimmer ist sehr schön, wie aus dem Fels gehauen!
Das Hotel ist mitten in der Altstadt, somit keine Aussicht aus dem Zimmer. 
Taxi kann nicht Vorfahren. 
Sehr zuvorkommenden Service
Das ideale Hotel für eine Städtereisen zu zweit 
Ideale Ausgangslage, da praktisch alles gut zu Fuss erreichbar ist
",5,2013,07,18
14,Tutto sbagliato,"Di certo nella scelta dell'Hotel Neri ho commesso degli errori. Ritenevo che fosse al centro della città ma invece si trova vicino al centro del potere politico ed alla Cattedrale, ma ben lontano dalla Sagrada Familia e dal Paseo, in una stradina difficilissima da trovare e dove i taxi devono accedere a ...marcia indietro. Non vi dico l'uscire dall'Hotel in taxi, alla ricerca di una strda che non fosse bloccata dai dissuasori...Inoltre ci sono stato il 1 Maggio, con manifestazioni all'angolo e praticamente recluso in questo albergo, molto costoso, dove la sola colazione del mattino, che si paga a parte costa 19 euro!!!. Infine gran design, che non è detto piaccia a tutti, ma poca sostanza. personale di buon livello, ma l'impresa non vale la spesa anche se non si può dire che sia brutto, anche se sarete spaventati dai cumuli di immondizia che sono all'ingresso.",3,2013,05,02
14,UNA CENA ROMÁNTICA MARAVILLOSA,"Un restaurante excepcional, si tuviera que definir la experiencia como un espectáculo, diria que soberbio, el Cheff  magistral  y el resto del personal a su altura. La relación calidad precio buena, hicimos un menú degustación con oferta de un portal gastronómico y salimos mi mujer y yo por 140'-€ más o menos, pero como os digo no fue caro para la calidad y el servicio de todo lo que comimos. Ah!, si vais en temporada no dejeis de probar el plato de trufa, con una presentación increible y un mejor sabor, y como se dice hasta ahí puedo decir, ahora si quereis saber más debeis probarlo vosotros. Un saludo bien grande al Chef Sr. Iranzo y a todo su equipo de Jesús de Copivalles. Volveremos seguro.",5,2013,02,04
14,Wunderbare Erfahrung- subtiles Geschmackserlebnis,"Wir nahmen das Degustationsmenue, das halbjährlich neu zusammengestellt wird. Quantitativ: zusätzlich zu den angekündigten  sechs Gängen wurde noch je ein kaltes und ein warmes Häppchen vorher serviert, jeweils zu den Gängen andere passende Brotsorten, sowie zum Digestif weitere köstliche Süssigkeiten. Qualitatv: Jeder einzelne Gang war perfekt abgestimmt, jeder Bissen eine neue Geschmacksvariante, abhängig von der Kombination der einzelnen Bestandteile auf der Gabel. Auf Nachfrage kompetente Informationen zu den Gerichten, charmant, kein Gastrogeschwafel, nicht belehrend. Angenehme Atmosphäre. Unsere Vorbehalte gegen Restaurants in Hotels ( abgesehen von Sternegastronomie) wurden Lügen gestraft. Preis- Leistungsverhältnis absolut angemessen. ",5,2013,01,06
14,La' forza' del design.....,"Trovare l'hotel Neri nell'intrico delle viuzze che si snodano intorno alla Cattedrale non è stata cosa facile, soprattutto per chi, come noi, mancava da Barcelona ormai da dieci anni. E' stato comunque assai divertente camminare qualche centinaio di metri sull'acciottolato lucido del Barrio Gotico, trascinando i nostri trolleys rumorosi, alla ricerca di una insegna che sembrava non apparire mai. E poi eccolo, il monumento dell'ospitalità 'minimal-chic' della Catalogna: bella la hall, spaziosa ed elegante; belli e gentili il portiere ed i ragazzi della conciergerie. Bella la nostra stanza, Stark,  prodotti italiani di altissima qualità....Meno bello il panorama: un palazzotto rifatto di recente, con l'assetto di un alveare..Leggo in altre recensioni dei prezzi, che sono difatti assai alti, almeno nei listini protocollari; consiglio di approfittare delle offerte (frequenti) che, in alcuni casi, fanno risparmiare fino a 200 euro a notte.",4,2012,11,26
14,bella la struttura ma con delle pecche...,"Sono stata ""OSPITE"" dell'hotel mercoledi 7 novembre 2012, è davvero bellissimo con una atmosfera davvero piena di relax e poesia,le camere sono carine pienedi comfort si nei minimi dettagli del bagno,non mancava proprio nulla,pulizia e arredi,lenzuola,tutto perfetto.....ma per il prezzo molto caro dell'hotel e non avendo la colazione inclusa ma solo con un supplemento fuori prezzo assolutamente,non posso concepire di ordinare la colasione in camera,per darmi un lusso in più e ordino un pancake e me ne arriva uno di numero al prezzo di 9€,mi è arrivato freddo e senza le posate per mangiarlo,inconcepibile,quando l'ho fatto presente alla reception si sono scusati carinamete,ma cmq la mia colazione è stata rovinata e il mio pancake costosissimo non gustato come avrei deisiderato.
Non ho provato la cucina del ristorante perchè nel momento dell'accoglienza ""check in""non ci è stato detto che occorreva prenotarsi,poco male siamo andati in un ristorantino li vicino molto buono e carino.
Altra pecca e ultima per mema non da poco,quando il ristorante è all'opera e cucinano l'odore del mangiare intenso e fastidiosissimo si sente in tutto l'hotel fino ai piani superiori.

BELLO MOLTO MA TROPPO CARO",3,2012,11,10
14,Overpriced,"La location e' senza dubbio bella come pure la posizione, ma il servizio , il personale e il livello di preparazione NON SONO ASSOLUTAMENTE livello. per tre notti ho speso 1200 euro con quella cifra penso che un cliente abbia diritto ad un trattamento esclusivo. A mio modo di vedere il neri fa parte di una moda moderna che vuole stupire senza avere le solide basi di un personale adeguatamente preparato per quella cifra il servizio deve essere perfetto ed efficiente in tutto. In sostanza il neri vale 150 euro a notte quindi e' decisamente OVERPRICED.",2,2012,11,04
14,Neri - ein tolles Hotel mitten im Zentrum,"Wir haben einen sehr schönen Kurzurlaub in Barcelona gehabt - insbesondere auch wegen des Neri.

Das Hotel liegt fantastisch um die Ecke des Platzes Jaume I. gelegen. So lässt sich die architektonisch schöne Altstadt optimal erkunden. 

Die Zimmer im zweiten Stock sind sehr stilvoll eingerichtet, man vermisst nichts. Insgesamt ist in dem Hotel, dass in einen alten Stadtpalast gebaut wurde, eine bemerkenswerte Kombination zwischen Historie und Moderne verwirklicht worden.

Ein besonderes Highlight ist das Frühstück, dass ganz hervorragend ist. Frische Früchte, sehr gute Eier, toller Schinken, frisches Brot und weitere Leckereien - alles vom Feinsten.

Ein weiterer Vorteil ist das einwandfrei funktionierende, kostenfreie WLAN.

Der Service war gut und sehr aufmerksam. Nicht zuletzt ist ein weiterer Vorteil, dass das Hotel nur 22 Zimmer hat, wodurch eine ruhige und persönliche Atmosphere aufrecht erhalten werden kann.

Zwei Mankos sind zu berücksichtigen: 
- Schlechter Geruch in der Lobby aufgrund wahrscheinlich alter Wasserleitungen 
- Kurzzeitig nachts laut auf dem Platz hinter dem Hotel

Insgesamt ist das Nerfast uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen.",4,2012,09,17
14,Bufff,"El hotel es bonito, si bien, y al menos si te alojas en una habitación que de a la plaza, es difícil pegar ojo por el ruido que hay por las noches. 

El trato es bueno hasta que se presenta algún problema. Entonces ya no lo es tanto.",3,2012,08,21
14,Una cena meravigliosa,"Abbiamo cenato al ristorante dell'hotel Neri in occasione di un importante evento. Apetizer impeccabili e innovativi, secondi di carne e pescado di qualità eccellente. Grande professionalità e cortseia.
Assolutamente da provare.",5,2012,08,16
14,Excelente Experiencia,"Excelente ubicaion para conocer, caminar y tener la experiencia de la ciudad vieja de Barcelona ... todas las calles, callejoenes y esquinas...
El personal y cuarto es de primera ... el desayuno muy original ... El trato es bueno y te recomiendas planes de caminar o andar en bicicleta en la zona... Lo recomiendo !!!!
El Bar de la Azotea es original ...
Tomen fotos ....",4,2012,08,09
14,Buena experiencia,"Me alojado en el hotel Neri varias veces, tanto para dormir, como para la comida familiar de navidad, todo el hotel esta muy cuidado, el servicio es muy bueno y muy gentil.
Las habitaciones están bastante bien, y son bastante grandes, los baños de pizarra son amplios y cómodos, el hotel es un antiguo palacete que al restaurarlo han dejado detalles como la escalera de la entrada de piedra que son bastante impresionantes.La situación es buena, en pleno centro de barcelona, pero alejado del bullicio. Lo que recuerdo de la comida de navidad familiar, es un servicio impecable, una cocina de autor, con platos muy muy elaborados",5,2012,04,09
14,Preis/Leistung stimmt nicht,"Leider schlechte Erreichbarkeit (wobei tolle Lage). Kein Service bei Anreise mit dem Auto, Taxifahrer die das übernehmen bekommen nicht mal das Parkticket des Parkhauses erstattet.

Zimmer sehr schön! Tolles Bett im Vergleich zu vielen anderen Hotels, die wir besucht haben.

Achtung mit dem Aufzug. Die Türen schlossen und verletzten mich.

Der Frühstückservice war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Leider auch hier im Hotel Kaffee aus dem Automaten. Bei der Beschreibung und den Preisen hätten wir etwas anderes erwartet.

Unser Aufenthalt im Restaurant war mäßig schön. Telefonische Reservierung vom Vortag wurde nicht gefunden (bei einer Anzahl von 10 Tischen kann man schon mal die Übersicht verlieren). Dann wollte man uns vertrösten (Super Idee am Karfreitag) allerdings wurde dann doch schnell der bestellte Tisch bereitgestellt, obwohl ja alles voll besetzt war. Die Gerichte waren sehr schön angerichtet! Großes Lob an die Küche! 

Was hier wirklich nervte war die Restaurantchefin! Ob man etwas erzählt bekommen wollte oder nicht, sie zog ihr Program durch. 

Leider war die Zeit für das Essen zu kurz. Restaurant öffnete um 20:30 Uhr - 23:00 Uhr. Bis alle Gäste mit Essen versorgt waren, war auch schon Feierabend. Die Rechnung bekam dann auch jeder Gast unaufgefordert auf den Tisch gestellt. 

Kurzum: um das beschriebene Niveau zu erreichen und das Preisleistungsverhältnis ins Gleichgewicht zu bringen bedarf es noch etwas Übung.",3,2012,04,07
14,Hotel incantevole nel cuore di Barcellona!,"Ho soggiornato al Relais & Chateaux Hotel Neri insieme alla mia ragazza da Sabato 17 a Martedì 20 Marzo e siamo stati benissimo!
L'hotel é incantevole e si trova nel cuore di Barcellona nella zona pedonale a 1 minuto a piedi dalla Cattedrale e a 5 minuti a piedi dalla Rambla e anche da Plaza Catalunya.
La location é eccezionale, l'hotel molto ben curato, le camere belle e spaziose e il servizio molto attento, gentile e professionale.
Lo staff sia alla reception che al ristorante é molto disponibile ed é sempre pronto ad aiutare l'ospite e a venire incontro alle sue esigenze.
Siamo stati trattati benissimo e il nostro soggiorno é stato proprio fantastico.
Le prossime volte che torneremo a Barcellona pernotteremo sicuramente ancora al Neri Hotel e lo consigliamo caldamente a tutti. Eccellente!",5,2012,03,24
14,Si può trovare qualcosa di meglio?,"Affacciato sulla centralissima piazza Felipe Neri, in un antico palazzo restaurato con grande gusto, un piccolo hotel che merita di essere frequentato. Ben arredate e spaziose le camere, buono il ristorante. I costi sono adeguati all' alto livello offerto. Vogliamo trovare un difetto? La rumorosa uscita dell' asilo nella minuscola, bellissima piazzetta.",5,2012,03,20
14,Isla de tranquilidad en el centro de la ciudad.,"Excelente relación calidad-precio. Servicio de habitaciones y de restaurante es de alto nivel.
Ubicación privilegiada en pleno barrio Gótico de Barcelona. Habitaciones bien equipadas y tranquilas, la zona no permite circulación de coches y el descanso nocturno está asegurado. Amenities de baño de calidad.",5,2012,03,15
14,Buena Experiencia pero hay que refinar algunos detalles,"Es un hotel muy lindo y ubicado en el corazon historico de Barcelona. Hubo detalles que valen la pena mejorar para subir a ""excelente"". En la tina filtraba agua y el piso del baño pasaba mojado. La atención fue muy atenta pero al momento de pedir recomendaciones costaba encontrar lugares recomendables. Falta más servicio de conserje. Hubo algunos malos olores en la recepción en ciertos horarios. Seguramente un problema de ventilación que se puede solucionar. Especialmente destacable el servicio y sonrisa de Mar. Muy atenta.",4,2012,03,06
14,Eine Perle im gotischen Viertel!,"Das Hotel Neri ist eine absolute Perle im gotischen Viertel. Von aussen kaum wahrnehmbar, wähnt man sich im Inneren in einer anderen Welt. Lounge-Musik, gekühlte Räume, eine Bibliothek zum Entspannen und Zimmer die absolute Ruhe bieten. Das Badezimmer ist toll und die Terasse mit den Hängematten zum Ausspannen wie geschaffen. Da müssen Sie hin! Auch das spezielle Frühstück das hübsch arrangiert auf einem Tablett daherkommt ist erwähnenswert- wenn auch einwenig teuer.",5,2011,08,09
14,"Gute Lage, schönes Hotel","Lage: Das wirklich beste am Hotel ist die geniale Lage, besser gehts wirklich nicht mehr!
Design: Sehr cool, Uraltes Gemäuer modern interpretiert!
Zimmer: Für ein Städtehotel haben die Zimmer eine super Größe, Sehr schön... lediglich die Kunststoff Badewanne störte ein wenig..
Personal: Hotelpersonal ist ganz okay....ganz im Gegenteil zu einige Mitarbeitern im Restaurant (wird eigens bewertet)
Fazit: Nicht ganz billig aber wirklich toll!",4,2011,07,07
14,Sehr gutes Stadthotel,"Das mitten in der Altstadt gelegene Hotel eignet sich sehr gut um die Stadt zu besichtigen. Das von Aussen unscheinbare Hotel, überrascht durch die schön renovierten Zimmer und das gute Restaurant mit Bar. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer schön gross, gut ausgestattet, sauber und sehr ruhig. Die schmale Gasse an der das Hotel liegt, ist praktisch autofrei.",4,2010,06,13
14,Hotel Pieno di Atmosfera,"Consiglio vivamente questo hotel ubicato nel centro storico della città.
Ho soggiornato in Junior Suite (la più bella è quella che si affaccia sula Piazza Filippo Neri).
E' un palazzo storico restrutturato in modo magnifico.",5,2010,02,15
14,"Fantastisches Hotel, eine Perle in toller Lage und Design","ein Kleinod inmitten des Gotischen Viertels, absolut ruhig und doch mitten drin gelegen, tolle Zimmer und Einrichtung unbedingt ausprobieren!!!",5,2009,08,14
